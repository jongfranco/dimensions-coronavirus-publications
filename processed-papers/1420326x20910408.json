The fight against the coronavirus infection should be an emergency affair, which can only be overcome by active cooperation of different trades and professions, such as medical industry, transportation, logistics, government administration, product production technology manufacturers, etc. Several urgent tasks have to be carried out during the outbreak control process.",

            "(1) Establishing a national popularization mechanism for health science: Health science popularization has been incorporated into the healthy China strategy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>] This would be the most effective way to enable citizens to understand and accept health science popularization, which could be written into the teaching materials of primary, middle and high schools, even into the syllabus of teaching and examination. For other members of the public, we should increase the strength and depth of the science popularization, and to encourage the growth in the understanding and practises of the knowledge of the health science popularization into people\u2019s daily life. (2) Improving the emergency security mechanism: The overall top-level design of the health emergency system should be carried out, making clear planning and documenting standards of strategic health materials in various regions, so as to prepare for the epidemic situation or the urgent need in time of outbreak crisis or disaster. (3) Establishing multi-industry coordination mechanism: A collaborative linkage logistic mechanism should be established between multi industries and various sectors of the society, such as government administration, health care, transportation, construction environmental protection, social management, etc. when the epidemic occurs, all sectors of the society should be coordinated to enable rapid response, with both division of labour and cooperation, so as to improve the response efficiency to public emergencies."
