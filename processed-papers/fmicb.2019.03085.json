        "abstract": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a porcine intestinal coronavirus that causes fatal severe watery diarrhea in piglets. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the only IgG transport receptor, its expression on mucosal surfaces is triggered upon viral stimulation, which significantly enhances mucosal immunity. We utilized TGEV as a model pathogen to explore the role of FcRn in resisting viral invasion in overall intestinal mucosal immunity. TGEV induced FcRn expression by activating NF-\u03baB signaling in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. First, using small interfering RNAs, we found that TGEV up-regulated FcRn expression via TLR3, TLR9 and RIG-I. Moreover, TGEV induced IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL8, TGF-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 production. TGF-\u03b2-stimulated IPEC-J2 cells highly up-regulated FcRn expression, while treatment with a JNK-specific inhibitor down-regulated the expression. TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein also enhanced FcRn promoter activity via the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and its central region (aa 128\u2013252) was essential for FcRn activation. Additionally, N protein-mediated FcRn up-regulation promotes IgG transcytosis. Thus, TGEV N protein and TGF-\u03b2 up-regulated FcRn expression, further clarifying the molecular mechanism of up-regulation of FcRn expression by TGEV.",

ORF1a and ORF1b, located in the 5 twothirds of the viral genome, are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) by the nsp3 and nsp5 proteases. These nsps are responsible for viral replication, viral transcription, and the antagonization of host innate immune responses.<br/><br/>Transmissible gastroenteritis virus replication occurs in the small intestinal epithelial cells, while viral entry and release are restricted to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. Neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is a specific receptor for the immunoglobulin IgG, which is expressed in many cells, including epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYe_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rYe_et+al_2008_a\">Ye et al, 2008</a>).

It has also been documented that the use of fusion proteins of the Fc fragment as immunogenic antigens can improve the impact of vaccines.

Most studies on FcRn have focused on the function of FcRn in humans and mice; so far, only a few relevant studies about pathogenic infection and FcRn expression regulation have been reported. In our previous study, TGEV induced FcRn expression via the NF-\u03baB pathway in IPEC-J2 cells (Guo et al, 2016b), but the regulatory mechanisms underlying this remain unclear; thus, we need to further explore the involvement of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), inflammatory factors, and virus-coding proteins in the regulation of FcRn."

            "TGEV-Induced FcRn Activation Is Closely Related to Viral Replication<br/><br/>To examine if TGEV infection induces FcRn promoter activation, IPEC-J2 cells were co-transfected with FcRn-luc or pRL-TK. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were incubated with live or UVinactivated TGEV for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-infection (hpi). Enhanced FcRn luciferase activities tended to increase during the progression of TGEV infection from 24 to 48 hpi, and this increase was significantly different compared with mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells (Figure 1A). Therefore, the up-regulation of FcRn is closely related to the replication of TGEV.<br/><br/>In order to determine whether TGEV induces FcRn expression in IPEC-J2 cells, live or UV-inactivated TGEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 was used to inoculate IPEC-J2 cells, which were then harvested for FcRn analysis at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hpi by RT-qPCR and Western blot (Figures 1B,C). TGEV induced FcRn mRNA expression about two fold higher at 24, 36, and 48 hpi, and the elevation in protein levels correlated with the increased mRNA. However, UV-inactivated viral treatment resulted in only a 1.3-fold up-regulation of FcRn expression compared with that in simulated infected cells, indicating that the replicating virus is more effective than the UV-inactivated virus."

            "The secretory IgA and IgG play major roles in mucosal antiinfection immunity and are obtained primarily through the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (plgR) and FcRn-mediated transport. Reovirus, dsRNA (a ligand for TLR3), LPS (a ligand for TLR4), IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2 all regulate pIgR expression (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJohansen_2004_a\" href=\"#rJohansen_2004_a\">Johansen and Brandtzaeg, 2004</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPal_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rPal_et+al_2005_a\">Pal et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSchneeman_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rSchneeman_et+al_2005_a\">Schneeman et al, 2005</a>). Therefore, LPS, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 could up-regulate the expression of FcRn via the NF-\u03baB pathway. NF\u03baB appears to be a positive regulator of FcRn expression. In our previous study, we identified that TGEV infection up-regulated FcRn via the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway (Guo et al, 2016b). Consistent with this, the replication of the virus is directly related to FcRn expression."

Enhanced FcRn luciferase activities tended to increase during the progression of TGEV infection from 24 to 48 hpi, and this increase was significantly different compared with mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells (Figure 1A). Therefore, the up-regulation of FcRn is closely related to the replication of TGEV.",

TGEV induced FcRn mRNA expression about two fold higher at 24, 36, and 48 hpi, and the elevation in protein levels correlated with the increased mRNA.

Transient transfection and RT-qPCR assays proved the low knockout efficiency of each siRNA, and the silencing efficiencies of the siRNAs to these receptors were over 50% (Figure 2A). The cells were transfected with each siRNA and then infected with TGEV; then, the changes in FcRn expression were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. The results showed that, compared with the cells transfected with NC siRNA, siRNA knockdown of TLR3, TLR9, RIG-I, TRIF, and MyD88 effectively reduced the TGEVinduced up-regulation of FcRn, while FcRn mRNA expression was not inhibited in cells transfected with siRNA targeting TLR2, TLR4, or TLR8 (Figure 2B).

In our previous study, we identified that TGEV infection up-regulated FcRn via the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway (Guo et al, 2016b). Consistent with this, the replication of the virus is directly related to FcRn expression.",

Both the SR-rich truncated proteins of the N protein of SARS coronavirus and PEDV can effectively promote the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhang_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rZhang_et+al_2007_a\">Zhang et al, 2007</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCao_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rCao_et+al_2015_a\">Cao et al, 2015a</a>).",
            "Epithelial TLR expression plays an important role in the innate and adaptive immune responses. NF-\u03baB is a branch of the downstream signaling pathways of TLR and RLR, which also play important roles in various immune responses. Diverse coronaviruses can escape host immune responses via NF-\u03baB activation through different pathways. PEDV activates NF-\u03baB signaling through TLRs, while mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) does so through RLRs (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2010_a\">Li et al, 2010</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCao_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rCao_et+al_2015_a\">Cao et al, 2015a</a>). IPECJ2 cells express mRNA encoding TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-18, TNF\u03b1, and GM-CSF (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBowie_2005_a\" href=\"#rBowie_2005_a\">Bowie and Haga, 2005</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBurkey_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rBurkey_et+al_2009_a\">Burkey et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMariani_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rMariani_et+al_2009_a\">Mariani et al, 2009</a>). Rotavirus infection triggers the production of IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in IECs by activating the TLR3 and RIG-I pathways (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBroquet_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rBroquet_et+al_2011_a\">Broquet et al, 2011</a>). Compared with the NC siRNA, TLR3-, TLR9-, RIG-, MyD88-, and TRIF-specific siRNAs inhibited TGEV-induced FcRn activation, while TLR2-, TLR4-, and TLR8-specific siRNAs did not. We speculate that TGEV activates NF-\u03baB via the TLR3, TLR9, and RIG-I pathways. Our results suggest that TLR3, TLR9, and RIG-I may be used to activate the FcRn signaling pathway when TGEV infects IPEC-J2 cells. Recently, our research has shown that PEDV down-regulate the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway to inhibit FcRn by TLR3 and",
            "RIG-I pathway in the early stage of infected piglets (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cQian_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rQian_et+al_2019_a\">Qian et al, 2019</a>). PEDV and PDCoV N protein inhibited IFN-\u03b2 by RIGI pathway (Ding et al, 2014b; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLikai_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rLikai_et+al_2019_a\">Likai et al, 2019</a>), and we found that TGEV N protein up-regulated FcRn by RIG-I pathway. Moreover, TGEV infection induced IFN-\u03b2 production and PEDV inhibited IFN-\u03b2 production (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAn_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rAn_et+al_2014_a\">An et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCao_et+al_2015_b\" href=\"#rCao_et+al_2015_b\">Cao et al, 2015b</a>). These results may be important causes of PEDV being more pathogenic than TGEV.",
            "Transgenic mice that overexpress hFcRn can improve the antigen presentation ability of dendritic cells and enhance the humoral immune response of the body (V\u00e9gh et al, 2012). FcRn not only transports IgG, but also transports antigen-antibody complexes, which are taken up by antigenpresenting cells (APCs) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRath_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rRath_et+al_2013_a\">Rath et al, 2013</a>). When the pathogen stimulates the mucosal epithelium, the expression of FcRn may be regulated. Simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection decreases FcRn and pIgR expression, which may also be the mechanism responsible for its pathogenesis in rhesus monkeys (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_2016_a\" href=\"#rWang_2016_a\">Wang and Yang, 2016</a>). On the other hand, TGEV up-regulates FcRn expression, which is potentially what provides the mucosal protection. To observe and measure IgG transcytosis in vitro, we applied the transwell system to mimic the porcine intestinal microenvironment, using IPEC-J2 cells to construct the transwell model, our previous research showed that FcRn not only transports specific antibodies across the mucosal epithelium in vitro, but also reduces the yield of TGEV (Guo et al, 2016a). We speculated that the up-regulation of FcRn by N protein may mediates more TGEV-specific antibody transcytosis across the mucosal epithelium, thereby enhancing the host\u2019s anti-infective ability. On the other hand, N protein-enhanced FcRn mediates more IgG immune complex transcytosis, followed by antigen uptake by specialized APCs to activate adaptive immune responses. Overall, we elucidated the immune mechanism of TGEV induced FcRn expression and provided a scientific and theoretical basis for the prevention and control of TGEV infection."
