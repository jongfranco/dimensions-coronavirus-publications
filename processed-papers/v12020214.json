        "abstract": "The genomes of coronaviruses carry accessory genes known to be associated with viral virulence. The single accessory gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), ORF3, is dispensable for virus replication in vitro, while viral mutants carrying ORF3 truncations exhibit an attenuated phenotype of which the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we studied the effect of ORF3 deletion on the proliferation of PEDV in Vero cells. To this end, four recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) were rescued using targeted RNA recombination, three carrying the full-length ORF3 gene from different PEDV strains, and one from which the ORF3 gene had been deleted entirely. Our results showed that PEDVs with intact or naturally truncated ORF3 replicated to significantly higher titers than PEDV without an ORF3. Further characterization revealed that the extent of apoptosis induced by PEDV infection was significantly lower with the viruses carrying an intact or C-terminally truncated ORF3 than with the virus lacking ORF3, indicating that the ORF3 protein as well as its truncated form interfered with the apoptosis process. Collectively, we conclude that PEDV ORF3 protein promotes virus proliferation by inhibiting cell apoptosis caused by virus infection. Our findings provide important insight into the role of ORF3 protein in the pathogenicity of PEDV.",

            "In conclusion, our study demonstrates PEDV ORF3 protein to promote virus proliferation through suppressing cellular apoptosis. However, we cannot exclude other mechanisms by which the ORF3 protein facilitates viral replication. It might, for instance, do so through its direct binding to the viral spike protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] or by interacting with cellular proteins [31]. Clearly, more research is needed to learn about the mechanism of the ORF3 protein\u2019s functioning in the proliferation of the virus."

The disease spread to Asia in the 1980s and caused great economic losses to the pig industry in the area, especially after 2010 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. In 2013, the disease also emerged and spread rapidly in North America, caused by a virus that most likely originated from Asia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].<br/><br/>PEDV is a positive-sense RNA virus classified in the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae. Its genome, about 28 kb in length, encodes two nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), four structural proteins\u2014the approximately 200 kDa glycosylated spike (S) protein, 8 kDa envelope (E) protein, 24 kDa membrane (M) protein, and 58 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein\u2014and one known accessory<br/><br/>Viruses 2020, 12, 214; doi:10.3390/v12020214 www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses<br/><br/>Viruses 2020, 12, 214 protein, the ORF3 protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Pp1a and pp1ab are the precursors of several enzymes and cofactors that together carry out PEDV genome replication and transcription. The S glycoprotein, trimers of which protrude from the viral membrane providing the coronaviruses their typical appearance, functions during cell entry by binding to cellular receptors and causing fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. The E protein has ion channel activity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and plays an important role in virion morphogenesis. The M protein is the main component of the viral envelope and interacts with all structural components during viral particle assembly.

            "Considering ORF3 is the only conserved accessory gene in all coronaviruses, it is safe to assume its encoded protein to be beneficial for these viruses\u2019 natural infection. Yet, there is thus far limited evidence for its precise role. In the case of PEDV, studies about ORF3 protein have been incoherent; many involved gene sequence analyses but few were about its biological functions. In a recent study, PEDV ORF3 protein was reported to have no effect on cell apoptosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. In the present study, using a unique system of reverse genetics, the ORF3 protein was demonstrated to enhance virus proliferation by a mechanism involving inhibition of cell apoptosis.<br/><br/>To enable a sensitive analysis of its effect on infection, we rescued several PEDVs differing in the nature of their ORF3. All the viruses had the same DR13att genetic backbone, their only difference being their ORF3. Rather than also making a recombinant virus expressing a truncated ORF3 protein (ORF3trun), we used the DR13att strain to examine the behavior of ORF3trun protein. We used these viruses to investigate whether the ORF3 protein plays a role in viral proliferation. By comparing the growth kinetics of the different viruses, we found that rPEDVs carrying ORF3, including also the one expressing the truncated form, proliferated faster and to higher titers than the virus without the gene, suggesting the ORF3 protein promotes the proliferation of PEDV in the cell culture system."

            "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and its causative pathogen, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), were first recognized in Europe in the 1970s [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The disease spread to Asia in the 1980s and caused great economic losses to the pig industry in the area, especially after 2010 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. In 2013, the disease also emerged and spread rapidly in North America, caused by a virus that most likely originated from Asia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].",
            "PEDV is a positive-sense RNA virus classified in the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae. Its genome, about 28 kb in length, encodes two nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), four structural proteins\u2014the approximately 200 kDa glycosylated spike (S) protein, 8 kDa envelope (E) protein, 24 kDa membrane (M) protein, and 58 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein\u2014and one known accessory",
            "Viruses 2020, 12, 214 protein, the ORF3 protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Pp1a and pp1ab are the precursors of several enzymes and cofactors that together carry out PEDV genome replication and transcription. The S glycoprotein, trimers of which protrude from the viral membrane providing the coronaviruses their typical appearance, functions during cell entry by binding to cellular receptors and causing fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. The E protein has ion channel activity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and plays an important role in virion morphogenesis. The M protein is the main component of the viral envelope and interacts with all structural components during viral particle assembly. The N protein packages the genomic RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid (RNP).",
            "ORF3 is located between the S and E genes; it is the only conserved ORF in all the genus of coronaviruses except Deltacoronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. PEDV ORF3 encodes a protein of 224 residues, which is about 25 kDa, but the gene is prone to undergo a 49\u201351 nucleotide (nt) deletion mutation when the virus is adapted to growth in cell culture, e.g., by serial passaging [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. The 49-nt deletion leads to a premature translation stop at nt 274 giving rise to a naturally truncated ORF3 protein of 92 residues designated ORF3trun, as is the case with ORF3 of the attenuated DR13 strain (DR13att), which was used as the backbone of the recombinant viruses generated in the present study. Another type of ORF3 variant, as occurring in PEDV strains 85-7 and AVCT12, has a 30 nt deletion at the 5 -end giving rise to a truncated ORF3 protein missing 70 residues at its N-terminus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Field isolates with longer-length deletions of ORF3 have also been documented [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "While there is accumulating evidence showing the ORF3 protein to be related to PEDV pathogenicity, the underlying mechanism is still elusive. The protein has been reported to function as an ion channel in both Xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast cells. Suppression of ORF3 expression by siRNA was found to inhibit the production of wild-type PEDV but not that of attenuated-type PEDV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Using a Vero cell line stably expressing ORF3, it was demonstrated that PEDV ORF3 protein prolonged the S phase of the cell cycle besides augmenting vesicle formation in the cells. Interestingly, constitutive expression of the ORF3 protein exerted a positive regulatory effect on the proliferation of attenuated PEDV but not on that of virulent PEDV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. In a more recent study, both the wild type and a mutant ORF3 protein lacking residues 82\u201398 were found to co-localize with the S protein intracellularly and at the cell surface, both in infected cells and during co-expression in transfected cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Additionally, a direct interaction of the S protein with each of these ORF3 proteins was demonstrated in such transfected cells by co-immunoprecipitation, leading the authors to suggest that the ORF3 protein might be involved in virus assembly.",
            "To extend our knowledge about the biological role of the ORF3 protein in PEDV infection, the aim of the present study was to reveal its effect on viral replication and to gain further insight into its role in pathogenicity. We generated four isogenic recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (rPEDVs) based on the genomic backbone of strain DR13att, three of them carrying an intact ORF3 derived from different virus strains and one from which ORF3 had been entirely deleted. With these rPEDVs and DR13att, we studied the function of ORF3 by comparing the titers of the viruses and the biological characteristics of the infected cells. We found that the ORF3 protein enhanced the proliferation of PEDV by a mechanism most likely involving inhibition of apoptosis in infected cells."

            "We used an earlier established reverse genetics system based on homologous RNA recombination [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] for generating PEDVs expressing different ORF3. To this end, four transfer vectors were constructed for use as templates for the transcription of the different recombination donor RNAs: pDR13att-ORF3wt, pDR13att-ORF3CV777, pDR13att-ORF3NY, and pDR13att-\u2206ORF3. They were constructed by substituting in vector pPEDV-DR13att the ORF3 sequence by the ORF3 sequences of PEDV strains DR13wt, CV777 and NY or by entirely deleting the ORF3 sequence from the construct (Figure 1A). The different ORF3 sequences were validated by sequencing and the vector constructs were validated by PCR analysis of the inserts (Figure 1B) and by double restriction digestion analysis with PmlI and AgeI (Figure 1C).",
            "To generate the different rPEDVs, in vitro RNA transcripts from pDR13att-ORF3wt, pDR13att-ORF3CV777, pDR13att-ORF3NY, or pDR13att-\u2206ORF3 were electro-transfected into LR7 cells that had been infected with mPEDV, after which the electroporated cells were co-cultured with Vero cells. CPE appeared in the Vero cells around 40 h post electroporation (Figure 2A). The recombinant viruses rDR13att-ORF3wt, rDR13att-ORF3CV777, rDR13att-ORF3NY, and rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 were purified on Vero cells by terminal dilution and stocks were prepared. For the verification of the recombinant viruses, RT-PCR was performed to amplify specific segments of the RNA genome for sequencing. Using primers mapping in the 3 -end of the S gene and the 5 -end of the E gene, DNA fragments of expected sizes were amplified, i.e., a 725 bp fragment amplified from rDR13att-ORF3wt, rDR13att-ORF3CV777, and rDR13att-ORF3NY, respectively, and a 309 bp fragment amplified from rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 (Figure 2B). Sequencing of the fragments further confirmed the results. Immunohistochemical analysis (IHA) with mouse anti-PEDV N monoclonal antibody showed all the rescued recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) to be able to infect the Vero cells (Figure 2C). The IHA analysis also showed ORF3 protein staining with the P71-3 antibody in Vero cells infected with recombinant viruses rDR13att-ORF3wt, rDR13att-ORF3CV777, and rDR13att-ORF3NY, but not in rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 infected and mock-infected cells (Figure 2D).

            "We subsequently examined the replication kinetics of the rPEDVs as well as of PEDV DR13att in Vero cells. As shown in Figure 3 (for primary data see Table S1), while their growth kinetics were all quite similar, all ORF3-expressing viruses\u2014including the one expressing ORF3trun\u2014grew to higher titers than the virus without ORF3. The three rPEDVs carrying a wild type ORF3-rDR13att-ORF3wt, rDR13att-ORF3CV777, and rDR13att-ORF3NY reached a maximal titer of approximately 105.7 TCID50/mL at ~24\u201332 h.p.i. The rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 grew less efficiently throughout the testing process, reaching a peak titer of 105.3 TCID50/mL, which was approximately 90% compared to the viruses having wild type ORF3. The DR13att vaccine strain reached a titer of 105.8 TCID50/mL at 40 h.p.i., the highest titer among the five PEDVs examined. Statistical analysis indicated the difference between the peak titers of rPEDVs with an intact ORF3 and that of the rPEDV without ORF3 to be significant (p < 0.05). Because all these PEDVs had the same genetic backbone except for their ORF3, the results indicated that the presence of an intact ORF3 protein-enhanced PEDV proliferation. In addition, also the naturally truncated ORF3 protein as it occurred in strain DR13att exhibited this enhancing effect on virus proliferation."

            "As more CPE was observed in Vero cells infected with rDR13att-\u2206ORF3, we sought to quantitate the effect of the ORF3 protein on cell viability of the infected cells. To this end, the four rPEDVs and the vaccine strain DR13att were applied to Vero cells at an MOI of 0.1 as described above. First, the live cells were counted at 24 and 36 h.p.i., which showed that their number in cultures infected with rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 was significantly less than when infected with the strains carrying the wild type or truncated ORF3, at both time points (p < 0.05, n = 3; Figure 4). Pictures taken at 30 h.p.i. also confirmed visually that the extent of CPE caused by infection with rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 was higher than after infection with the other viruses (Figure 5).",
            "To further confirm the effect of ORF3 protein on the condition of infected Vero cells, cellular viability was measured (in fact involving the measurement of formazan dye generated by dehydrogenases in live cells) at different time points after infection with the PEDVs. As indicated in Figure 6, as compared with mock-infected cells, the viability of the virus-infected cells decreased significantly in the course of infection. While the viabilities of the cells infected with the five PEDVs were the same in the early stage of infection (12 h.p.i.), differences appeared at later stages. The cell viabilities observed for rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 at 24, 36, and 48 h.p.i. were all significantly lower than those for the other four PEDVs (p < 0.05 at 24, 48 h.p.i.; p < 0.01 at 36 h.p.i.).

        "3.5. ORF3-Mediated Inhibition of Caspase-3 Cleavage in PEDV Infected Cells": [
            "One criterium to judge the apoptotic state of cells is by measuring the level of cleavage activation of caspase-3 in those cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Activated caspase-3 has been demonstrated earlier in PEDV-induced apoptosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. To check the cleaved caspase-3 level induced by the PEDV infection, Vero cells were infected with the viruses at an MOI of 2 (Figure 8). PEDV infected cells were gated by excluding the viral N protein negative cells (Figure 8A). The percentage of cells with cleaved caspase-3 was analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 8B). Consistent with the results from the dual Annexin V/7AAD cell labeling, we found a significantly higher (p < 0.01) cleaved caspase-3 level in the cells infected with rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 than when infected with the other viruses (23.3\u201328.1% vs. 45.4%; Figure 8B,C).",
            "We further verified the caspase-3 cleavage states in PEDV infected Vero cells by Western blot. Again, we observed a significant difference in the level of cleaved caspase-3 in rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 infected cells as compared with cells infected by the other viruses at 24 h.p.i. (Figure 8D). In contrast, when checking at the levels of S protein and uncleaved caspase-3, no obvious differences were found between the differently-infected cells. At the earlier infection time of 12 h.p.i., cleaved caspase-3 could not be detected in any of the infected cell populations (Figure S2). Interestingly, no significant difference was observed between the caspase-3 cleavage levels in DR13att infected cells expressing the truncated ORF3 protein and cells infected with the viruses expressing the full-length ORF3 proteins. These results were consistent with the findings obtained using the Annexin V/7AAD assay, implying that the C-terminally truncated ORF3 protein may have the same anti-apoptotic effects as the full-length form."
        ],
        "4. Discussion": [
            "Considering ORF3 is the only conserved accessory gene in all coronaviruses, it is safe to assume its encoded protein to be beneficial for these viruses\u2019 natural infection. Yet, there is thus far limited evidence for its precise role. In the case of PEDV, studies about ORF3 protein have been incoherent; many involved gene sequence analyses but few were about its biological functions. In a recent study, PEDV ORF3 protein was reported to have no effect on cell apoptosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. In the present study, using a unique system of reverse genetics, the ORF3 protein was demonstrated to enhance virus proliferation by a mechanism involving inhibition of cell apoptosis.",
            "To enable a sensitive analysis of its effect on infection, we rescued several PEDVs differing in the nature of their ORF3. All the viruses had the same DR13att genetic backbone, their only difference being their ORF3. Rather than also making a recombinant virus expressing a truncated ORF3 protein (ORF3trun), we used the DR13att strain to examine the behavior of ORF3trun protein. We used these viruses to investigate whether the ORF3 protein plays a role in viral proliferation. By comparing the growth kinetics of the different viruses, we found that rPEDVs carrying ORF3, including also the one expressing the truncated form, proliferated faster and to higher titers than the virus without the gene, suggesting the ORF3 protein promotes the proliferation of PEDV in the cell culture system.",
            "While growing the recombinant viruses, we noticed the development of CPE in cells infected with rDR13att-\u2206ORF3 to be more severe than with viruses carrying intact or truncated ORF3. Consistently, when measuring cellular viability in the course of infection by these viruses, we observed the same trend, i.e., enhanced cell death in the absence of ORF3 protein. This led us to suppose that the ORF3 protein, whether intact or truncated, reduces cell apoptosis, considering that infection by PEDV has been shown to induce this cellular reaction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found both ORF3wt and ORF3trun protein to exhibit anti-apoptotic properties.",
            "Apoptosis is considered to be a host innate defense mechanism that disrupts viral replication by eliminating virus-infected cells. Viruses have consequently developed strategies to reduce apoptosis, which, in turn, prevents premature cell death, thereby maximizing progeny virus production [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. In this study, we observed the use of such a strategy by PEDV. The viruses carrying an ORF3 not only grew to higher titers than the virus lacking the ORF, but their infection also caused less apoptosis, as judged by apoptotic indicators such as TUNEL labeling, translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and activation of caspase-3. The observations indicate inhibition of procaspase-3 activation to be the possible mechanism of ORF3 protein-mediated host cell apoptosis. On the other hand, many viruses have the ability to actively induce apoptosis to facilitate the release and dissemination of viral progeny to neighboring cells. This pro-apoptotic property is one of the cytolytic effects of viral infections causing CPE in vitro, and it supposedly plays a pathogenic role by contributing to cell damage, tissue injury, and disease severity in vivo. This process has been observed particularly in RNA viruses, including Coronaviridae [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. In addition, for PEDV, the induction of apoptotic cell death has recently been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The process was found to be caspase-independent but to be mediated by activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. While apoptosis facilitates the release of virions from infected cells, proper timing of its induction seems desirable for the virus, as a too early breakdown of the cells would reduce the time and space for its propagation. Hence, we propose that, while PEDV apparently takes advantage of the effects of cellular apoptosis, its ORF3 protein may function to delay these processes in order to extend time and space for the virus to multiply. This may be a built-in mechanism of PEDV to maximize the production of its offspring.",
            "While truncation of the ORF3 protein was found by Wang et al to strongly reduce the protein\u2019s ion channel activity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], in our study it did not influence the protein\u2019s effects on virus proliferation and cell apoptosis. Since the same or similar truncations have been found repeatedly in several independently obtained PEDV strains after serial passaging, there is an apparent selection for viruses still expressing the N-terminal part of the protein. It is tempting to speculate that this selection aims to maintain the favorable growth phenotype of the virus. Loss of the downstream C-terminal part of the protein is associated with attenuation of virulence in the natural host, suggesting that, as earlier proposed by Wang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], the ORF3 protein\u2019s ion channel activity is associated with the virulence of PEDV. Other functions of this C-terminal part, however, such as interference with innate host immunity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>], cannot be excluded and this warrants further research.",
            "Earlier studies on the function of the PEDV ORF3 protein have not yielded a consistent picture. Wang et al used a siRNA approach targeting the viral sub-genomic mRNA3, which encodes the ORF3 protein to study its role in viral replication. While they did observe a strong reduction in infectious virus production for the wild type CV777 strain, no effect was detected for its attenuated derivative, which carried an ORF3trun [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Though the actual effect of the siRNA treatment on mRNA3 or ORF3 protein levels was not assessed, their results were consistent with a positive role in virus production for the wild type but not for the truncated ORF3 protein. In a study by Ye et al a Vero cell line stably expressing the wild type ORF3 protein was established [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Virus yields in these cells were found to be similar to those in the parental cells when infected with field strain CH/YNKM-8/2013. A clear increase in infectious virus production was, however, observed with attenuated PEDV strains CV777 and AH-M. Quite a mysterious ORF3 protein was described by Jongkaewwattana\u2019s laboratory [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. This intact ORF3 protein, named ORF3NP12 and derived from the Chinese strain JS-2004-2, was found to block the rescue of the infectious virus when its gene was incorporated into strain PEDVAVCT12. The rescue was, however, successful when the full-size gene was replaced by its truncated form. The inhibitory effect of ORF3NP12 on replication, which was even observed in the context of infection by a totally different virus (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus), was attributed to two residues (F81 and M167) which, when mutated (F81L or M167S), restored the normal phenotype. It remains puzzling, however, how the strain JS-2004-2 carrying ORF3NP12 was able to cope with the inhibitory of effects of this ORF3 protein.",
            "In conclusion, our study demonstrates PEDV ORF3 protein to promote virus proliferation through suppressing cellular apoptosis. However, we cannot exclude other mechanisms by which the ORF3 protein facilitates viral replication. It might, for instance, do so through its direct binding to the viral spike protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] or by interacting with cellular proteins [31]. Clearly, more research is needed to learn about the mechanism of the ORF3 protein\u2019s functioning in the proliferation of the virus."
