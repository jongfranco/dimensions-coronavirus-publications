            "Airborne transmission between persons is a valid and major respiratory transmission route for a number of infectious diseases (CDC 2007, 2017; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHodgson_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rHodgson_et+al_2012_a\">Hodgson et al 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2015_a\">Li et al 2015</a>). Worldwide there are approximately 3.0 million deaths annually caused by lower respiratory infections (WHO 2018). Airborne transmission has been shown to occur within an enclosed indoor space (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rLiu_et+al_2017_a\">Liu et al 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAi_2018_a\" href=\"#rAi_2018_a\">Ai and Melikov 2018</a>), between different rooms on a same floor (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2016_a\">Wu et al 2016</a>), between different flats in the same building (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGao_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rGao_et+al_2009_a\">Gao et al 2009</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAi_2016_a\" href=\"#rAi_2016_a\">Ai and Mak 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMu_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rMu_et+al_2016_a\">Mu et al 2016</a>) and even between adjacent buildings in high-density urban areas (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYu_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rYu_et+al_2004_a\">Yu et al 2004</a>). Understanding the transmission characteristics, high-risk routes and influential factors is of great importance for formulating effective control measures, which would in turn contribute to reduced number of deaths and illness leaves as well as lowered health care costs. The whole process of airborne transmission between persons involves the generation of infectious droplets from an infected person, the spread of infectious droplet nuclei in the air and the inhalation of infectious droplet nuclei by an exposed person (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNicas_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rNicas_et+al_2005_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNicas_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rNicas_et+al_2005_a\">Nicas et al 2005</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTang_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rTang_et+al_2006_a\">Tang et al 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWei_2016_a\" href=\"#rWei_2016_a\">Wei and Li 2016</a>).

Most of these droplets evaporate instantaneously to half of their initial size and become droplet nuclei (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNicas_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rNicas_et+al_2005_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNicas_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rNicas_et+al_2005_a\">Nicas et al 2005</a></a>). These droplet nuclei spread in the air with the influence of factors like gravity, inertia, ventilation flow, human body boundary layer flow and respiratory flow (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMelikov_2015_a\" href=\"#rMelikov_2015_a\">Melikov 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2016_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2016_a\">Nazaroff 2016</a>).

            "<strong>Conclusion and future possibilities</strong><br/><br/>Tracer gas is a suitable surrogate of exhaled droplet nuclei for studying airborne transmission in the built environment, because (a) if a disease is found to be transmitted via airborne route, it is mostly the fine droplet nuclei generated by human respiratory processes that are the vehicles of pathogens, and fine droplet nuclei have aerodynamics more close to a gas, (b) studies show that the movement of fine particles less than 3\u20135 \u03bcm can be well represented with tracer gas simulation, and (c) tracer gas simulation is of lower complexity and less demand on user knowledge and thus it is easier to obtain reliable results. Note that dispersion and deposition of droplet nuclei in the respiratory tract were not discussed in this paper.<br/><br/>As reviewed, tracer gas simulation and particle simulation of droplet nuclei have different error sources. Few studies have evaluated quantitatively the error of particle simulation. It would be interesting to assess whether or not the error of tracer gas simulation is smaller than the error of particle simulation, when compared to the real-life dispersion of exhaled droplet nuclei. In addition, few studies have compared the dispersion characteristics of different tracer gases, and it is still unknown how different are the experimental results obtained by using different tracer gases (i.e., different densities, diffusion coefficients and Schmidt numbers). Further studies are required."

            "Compared with tracer gas simulation of the exhaled droplet nuclei, there are several deficiencies and difficulties associated with particle simulation. Firstly, in experimental contexts, the experimental space for particle simulation has to meet certain criteria so that the particles from other sources would not influence the measurements. Examples of these sources include particles in background and supply air and the resuspension of particles from surfaces of the space. Secondly, particle generators are normally stand-alone from a thermal manikin, where the influence of the presence of occupants and their thermal boundary conditions was not taken into account (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSze_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rSze_et+al_2009_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSze_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rSze_et+al_2009_a\">Sze et al 2009</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPoon_2011_a\" href=\"#rPoon_2011_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPoon_2011_a\" href=\"#rPoon_2011_a\">Poon and Lai 2011</a></a>; Pantelic and Tham 2013; Pantlic et al 2015; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCao_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rCao_et+al_2015_a\">Cao et al 2015</a>). Very few studies have successfully dosed aerosols through the breathing system of a thermal manikin. The major reason reported was that the integration of an aerosol generator into the breathing system of a manikin would easily result in the blockage of the breathing system, due to the narrow \u201crespiratory tract\u201d and the relatively low expiratory speed of aerosol particles (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAi_2018_a\" href=\"#rAi_2018_a\">Ai and Melikov 2018</a>). Thirdly, the aerosol generators reported in past studies could not simulate accurately the number and size distribution of human expiratory droplet nuclei (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSze_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rSze_et+al_2009_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSze_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rSze_et+al_2009_a\">Sze et al 2009</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPoon_2011_a\" href=\"#rPoon_2011_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPoon_2011_a\" href=\"#rPoon_2011_a\">Poon and Lai 2011</a></a>; Ai et al / Building Simulation",
            "Pantelic and Tham 2013; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCao_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rCao_et+al_2015_a\">Cao et al 2015</a>; Pantlic et al 2015), though most generators produce a range of particle sizes simultaneously (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSze_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rSze_et+al_2009_a\">Sze et al 2009</a>). In addition, it is unknown to what extent the particles produced by these available generators are the same with expiratory droplet nuclei, in terms of quantity, size distribution, thermo-fluid properties and dynamics. Fourthly, the particle dynamics and fate are complicated (see Fig. 1), which is required in order to set up and perform the experiments properly and to analyze the data and explain the phenomena quantitatively. The movement of particles in turbulent flow is governed by gravitational force, thermophoretic force, Brownian force, and Saffman\u2019s lift force (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\">Nazaroff 2004</a></a>, 2016). In addition, particles could deposit on surfaces, re-suspend from surfaces, coagulate, change phase etc. (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\">Nazaroff 2004</a></a>, 2016). In numerical context, fully considering all dynamics and fates of particles in airflows in the built environment is impossible at the present. Knowledge on the relative importance of each force and fate in connection with particle size and particle volume loading in air is required in order to make reasonable assumptions and simplifications in numerical models. Fifthly, there are quite several uncertainties associated with the risk of cross infection, including the number concentration and size distribution of droplet nuclei generated by each respiratory process including coughing, sneezing and speaking, the frequency of the respiratory process, the infectivity of the virus concerned, the lifetime of the virus, the vulnerability of the exposed person. In addition, the droplet concentration and its size distribution can be influenced by many factors, such as body weight, gender, and age (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2007_a\">Yang et al 2007</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJohnson_2009_a\" href=\"#rJohnson_2009_a\">Johnson and Morawska 2009</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZayas_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rZayas_et+al_2012_a\">Zayas et al 2012</a>). It is reported that, generally for a same person, among the processes of mouth exhalation, nose exhalation, coughing and speaking, coughing produces the largest droplet concentrations (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLindsley_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLindsley_et+al_2012_a\">Lindsley et al 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMorawska_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rMorawska_et+al_2013_a\">Morawska et al 2013</a>) and nose exhalation the least (Papineni and",
            "Rosenthal 1997). The error caused by these uncertainties may be comparable with that of tracer gas simulation of particles. Sixthly, some studies (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhu_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rZhu_et+al_2006_a\">Zhu et al 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRim_2009_a\" href=\"#rRim_2009_a\">Rim and Novoselac 2009</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPoon_2011_a\" href=\"#rPoon_2011_a\">Poon and Lai 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2016_a\">Yang et al 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rLiu_et+al_2017_a\">Liu et al 2017</a>) examined the dispersion of particles of different sizes, but most of them had no conclusion on the influence of particle size on the risk of cross infection, primarily because of the uncertainties mentioned above. In summary, the particle simulation cannot ensure an accurate modeling of the dispersion of expiratory droplet nuclei between persons, and the knowledge deficiency and the difficulties attached decrease the probability of obtaining reliable results.",
            "The statement in this paper is that tracer gas is a suitable surrogate of exhaled droplet nuclei for studying airborne transmission in the built environment. Most studies on airborne transmission between occupants in different spatial scales in the built environment were based on tracer gas simulation (e.g., <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cQian_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rQian_et+al_2008_a\">Qian et al 2008</a>; Bolashikov et al 2015; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLipczynska_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rLipczynska_et+al_2015_a\">Lipczynska et al 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2015_a\">Yang et al 2015</a>; Villafruela et al 2016; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rLiu_et+al_2017_a\">Liu et al 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAi_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rAi_et+al_2019_a\">Ai et al 2019</a>). The reasons for the popularity of tracer gas simulation should be attributed to not only the deficiencies and difficulties of particle simulation at the present stage, but also the well established tracer gas simulation techniques (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSherman_1990_a\" href=\"#rSherman_1990_a\">Sherman 1990</a>), their simplicity and good accuracy (described in Section 3). With the consideration that the main purpose of engineering studies of airborne transmission is to reveal the dispersion characteristics and its influential factors, to identify the major and highrisk dispersion routes, and to develop control measures, the proper use of tracer gas technique, and its pros and cons are reviewed in this paper."
        ],
        "2 Counter arguments": [
            "As the density of a particle is usually several orders of magnitude higher than air, a particle travelling in air is strongly influenced by its gravity and inertia (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHinds_1999_a\" href=\"#rHinds_1999_a\">Hinds 1999</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\">Nazaroff 2004</a></a>). In addition, a particle could deposit and be collected by solid surfaces after deposition, which is one of the most important fates of a particle in the air (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\">Nazaroff 2004</a></a>). A tracer gas in the air does not have such dynamic characteristics, and it is therefore no doubt that the gravity, inertia and deposition of a particle cannot be modelled using a tracer gas. In addition, the material of a particle, namely fluid or solid, determines the fact that a mixture of",
            "airflow and particles is typically a two-phase flow, where particles could departure from the main airstream and could even influence the airflow. Moreover, the coagulation and re-suspension are two important dynamic properties of particles (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThatcher_1995_a\" href=\"#rThatcher_1995_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThatcher_1995_a\" href=\"#rThatcher_1995_a\">Thatcher and Layton 1995</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\">Nazaroff 2004</a></a>). The coagulation occurs when particles collide with one another and adhere together, which shifts the size distribution of particles in the air. The most important mechanism causing coagulation is Brownian motion, which increases the chance of collision between particles. The important influence of coagulation on the concentration of particles emitted from unvented natural gas combustion was reported by <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDennekamp_et+al_2001_a\" href=\"#rDennekamp_et+al_2001_a\">Dennekamp et al (2001</a>). Particles that have been deposited at solid surfaces may become re-suspended into the air by many mechanical activities including walking. A few studies have observed the increase of particle concentration indoors due to resuspension resulted by human activities (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThatcher_1995_a\" href=\"#rThatcher_1995_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThatcher_1995_a\" href=\"#rThatcher_1995_a\">Thatcher and Layton 1995</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFerro_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rFerro_et+al_2004_a\">Ferro et al 2004</a>). Obviously, both coagulation and resuspension of particles cannot be simulated using a tracer gas. Furthermore, the droplet nuclei exhaled by human beings have different aerodynamic diameters, which could range from zero to dozens of micrometer (\u03bcm). The key attributes of particles, such as source, dynamic behavior and fate, are all strongly related to particle size (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\">Nazaroff 2004</a></a>). However, the dispersion characteristics of droplet nuclei with different size bins cannot be investigated using a tracer gas.",
            "All these counter arguments are correct. However, the importance of the particle dynamics mentioned above is strongly related to particle concentration and size distribution. For airborne transmission that is based on human expiratory droplet nuclei, they are less important and it is therefore believed that the tracer gas simulation is a suitable research method. The major reasons are listed below.",
            "Firstly, the respiratory droplet nuclei were found to range in diameter from 0.25 to 42 \u03bcm, of which 97% between 0.5 to 12 \u03bcm and the most common between 1 and 4 \u03bcm (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDuguid_1946_a\" href=\"#rDuguid_1946_a\">Duguid 1946</a>). Settling times for a 3-m fall are 17 minutes for 10 \u03bcm and 62 minutes for 5 \u03bcm, while droplet nuclei with a diameter less than 3 \u03bcm essentially do not settle (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTellier_2006_a\" href=\"#rTellier_2006_a\">Tellier 2006</a>). The relaxation times for fine particles are much smaller than the typical time scales of indoor airflow; droplet nuclei with 10 \u03bcm in diameter take only 1.55 ms to reach 99.3% of their terminal speeds indoors. These three aspects may support the fact that the main driving force of the movement of the majority of expiratory droplet nuclei is airflow, rather than gravity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2016_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2016_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2016_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2016_a\">Nazaroff 2016</a></a>). In addition, deposition at the solid surfaces is an important mechanism influencing the fate of droplet nuclei, only when the particle size is relatively large and the air exchange rate is small. It was reported that, for particles in the size range 0.5\u20131.0 \u03bcm, the deposition loss rate coefficient is 0.2\u20130.3 per hour for enclosed indoor environment (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThatcher_et+al_2002_a\" href=\"#rThatcher_et+al_2002_a\">Thatcher et al 2002</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2016_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2016_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2016_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2016_a\">Nazaroff 2016</a></a>). If, for example the air change rate is 3 h\u22121, the airborne particles have a characteristic residence time of 20 minutes in the room air, during which the probability of deposition for 0.5\u20131.0 \u03bcm particles is only 0.067\u20130.1. Note that the air change rate of a high-risk space or during a high-risk period, such as at hospital wards during the outbreak of infectious diseases, can be much higher than 3 h\u22121. Such a negligible deposition loss of fine particles was also supported by our CFD validation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGao_2007_a\" href=\"#rGao_2007_a\">Gao and Niu 2007</a>) against a particle experiment (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rChen_et+al_2006_a\">Chen et al 2006</a>), where 96% of 1.0 \u03bcm particles was found at ventilation exhaust, meaning that the deposition loss rate is only 4%.",
            "Secondly, the particle loading is the key parameter determining if the particle-flow interaction is important (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElghobashi_1994_a\" href=\"#rElghobashi_1994_a\">Elghobashi 1994</a>). When the particle loading represented by volume fraction is higher than 10\u22126, the influence of particles on turbulent flow would be important and the two-phase flow should be considered. The concentration of droplet nuclei generated by respiratory processes is generally much lower than this threshold loading. It was reported that 1.1\u20136.7 mg of saliva were collected on a mask during a single cough, and 18.7 mg were collected while counting from 1\u2013100 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhu_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rZhu_et+al_2006_a\">Zhu et al 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cXie_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rXie_et+al_2009_a\">Xie et al 2009</a>). A study by <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChao_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rChao_et+al_2009_a\">Chao et al (2009</a>) shows that the estimated total number of droplets at all sizes ranged from 947 to 2085 per cough and 112\u20136720 for speaking. Equivalently, the estimated droplet concentrations for coughing ranged from 2.4 to 5.2 cm\u22123 per cough and 0.004\u20130.223 cm\u22123 for speaking, which are much smaller than the threshold loading. However, as the frequency of respiratory processes is case dependent, the accurate loading of droplet nuclei is difficult to estimate. Many past CFD studies (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rChen_et+al_2006_a\">Chen et al 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGao_2007_a\" href=\"#rGao_2007_a\">Gao and Niu 2007</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGao_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rGao_et+al_2009_a\">Gao et al 2009</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhao_2016_a\" href=\"#rZhao_2016_a\">Zhao and Zhao 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cXu_2017_a\" href=\"#rXu_2017_a\">Xu and Wang 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMei_2019_a\" href=\"#rMei_2019_a\">Mei and Gong 2019</a>) using Eulerian method that treats the fluid phase and the particulate phase as continuum reported good agreements with experimental results, indicating that the simplification of one-way coupling for human expiratory droplet nuclei is reasonable.",
            "Thirdly, coagulation due to particle-particle interaction is important for very fine particles with several sources, when particle concentrations are high (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2004_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2004_a\">Nazaroff 2004</a>) and air exchange rate is low (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRivas_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rRivas_et+al_2015_a\">Rivas et al 2015</a>). <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKumar_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rKumar_et+al_2011_a\">Kumar et al (2011</a>) reported that, depending on the duration of interests, particle coagulation may be neglected for particles larger than 0.01 \u03bcm, as the coagulation is too slow to substantially affect the number concentrations. According to <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHinds_1999_a\" href=\"#rHinds_1999_a\">Hinds (1999</a>), coagulation rate is proportional to the square of the number concentration. Assuming a diameter of 1.0 \u03bcm and a concentration of 10 particles per cm3, 1% loss of particle number concentration by coagulation requires about 500 days (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGao_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rGao_et+al_2009_a\">Gao et al 2009</a>). Particle re-suspension from a solid surface is influenced by many parameters, such as particle size, surface material, and human activities. However, for fine particles, such as PM2.5, resuspension is very difficult and even human activities have a minor influence on it (Thatcher et al 1995). Considering also the low deposition rate of fine particles, the resuspension effect may also be neglected.",
            "Fourthly, though the different aerodynamic diameters cannot be examined using a tracer gas, the most important and major portion of airborne droplet nuclei exhaled by human beings falls in the range of less than 5\u201310 \u03bcm, especially within 2\u20133 \u03bcm. In addition, a tracer gas certainly cannot simulate large particles like 10 \u03bcm in diameter. However, in this paper, we would like to claim that a tracer gas is suitable to simulate the commonest range of expiratory droplet nuclei that is less than 5\u201310 \u03bcm. Justification of this claim is described in detail in Section 3."
        ],
        "3 Arguments": [
            "Argument No 1: if a disease is found to be transmitted via airborne route, it is mostly the fine droplet nuclei generated by human respiratory processes that are the vehicles of pathogens",
            "A study of ferrets found that transmission of influenza from infected to susceptible ferrets occurred despite the ferrets being separated by a long, straight air duct or by \u201cS\u201d or \u201cU\u201d-shaped ducts (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAndrewes_1941_a\" href=\"#rAndrewes_1941_a\">Andrewes and Glover 1941</a>). As large respiratory droplets could not move around the bends of the ducts whereas the smaller droplet nuclei could, this study may well indicate that fine airborne droplet nuclei were the major vehicles of pathogen, and that they could remain suspended in air for a prolonged period and be transported over an extended distance by airflows. Another study pointed out that the majority of droplets from human respiration activities are less than 5\u201310 \u03bcm in diameter (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNicas_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rNicas_et+al_2005_a\">Nicas et al 2005</a>), and this size range is used to differentiate between airborne transmission and droplet transmission. Another earlier study by <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDuguid_1946_a\" href=\"#rDuguid_1946_a\">Duguid (1946</a>) reported that 97% of human respiratory droplet nuclei ranged in diameter from 0.5 to 12 \u03bcm and the commonest range between 1 and 4 \u03bcm (see Fig. 2). In addition, the size of viruses is mostly from 0.02 to 0.3 \u03bcm. For examples, an individual SARS coronavirus ranges from 0.075 to 0.16 \u03bcm, and an influenza virus is of a similar size (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMorawska_2006_a\" href=\"#rMorawska_2006_a\">Morawska 2006</a>). <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLindsley_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rLindsley_et+al_2010_a\">Lindsley et al (2010</a>) measured influenza virus in droplet nuclei generated by coughing patients and reported that 42% of detected viruses were found in droplet nuclei less than 1 \u03bcm and 23% in droplet nuclei of 1\u20134 \u03bcm, which suggested that most viruses are contained within droplet nuclei in the very fine size range. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2011_a\">Yang et al (2011</a>) confirmed that a substantial fraction of the detected influenza A viruses was associated with fine particles smaller than 2.5 \u03bcm. It is known that fine particles travel readily between persons and penetrate and deposit deeply in the respiratory tract. Based on a semi-empirical model (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYeh_et+al_1996_a\" href=\"#rYeh_et+al_1996_a\">Yeh et al 1996</a>), particles around 3 \u03bcm have the highest deposition efficiency in the respiratory tract (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNazaroff_2016_a\" href=\"#rNazaroff_2016_a\">Nazaroff 2016</a>).",
            "Argument No 2: studies show that the accuracy of tracer gas simulation of fine particles can be good enough",
            "A few studies compared the dispersion of tracer gas and particles, which show that the accuracy of tracer gas simulation of fine particles can be good enough. These studies are briefly described below. Results of two studies are also summarized in Fig. 3.",

The results show that both the spatial distribution and co-occupant\u2019s exposure of particles not larger than 2.5 \u03bcm are very close to the tracer gas.",

            "In summary, these studies indicate that tracer gas simulation is accurate enough to study the dispersion of particles not larger than 3\u20135 \u03bcm. This size range is the dominant part of human expiratory droplet nuclei in terms of quantity.",
            "Argument No 3: tracer gas simulation is of lower complexity and less demand on user knowledge and thus it is easier to obtain reliable results",
            "As an alternative, tracer gas simulation is a well established research method both in experimental and numerical contexts. Experimentally, tracer gas simulation has been widely performed in different spatial scales, from a single room up to an urban area. For a single-room scale, tracer gas experiments do not have a special requirement on the cleanness of the experiment room, and the characteristics and area of the surfaces of the room do not obviously influence the experimental results. For an urban-area scale, there are very strong tracer gas sources to generate a large amount of tracer gas that allows the measurement at locations a few kilometers away from the source. Both the dosing system and the sampling system have been developed to a very high accuracy of control. The dosing system can be perfectly integrated with a breathing thermal manikin to include the influence of the presence of manikin body and its thermal boundary layer. The mixture of a tracer gas with air is a one-phase flow, which has nearly the same properties of air. There are no complicated dynamic processes, such as evaporation, condensation, coagulation, resuspension and phase change. Similarly, numerical simulation of tracer gas dispersion is much easier than particle simulation in terms of mathematical model complexity and practitioners\u2019 knowledge. In numerical context, a tracer gas is considered to be a passive scalar and only one more mass transport equation requires to be solved. The sensitivity of the influential parameters and constants (such as density, mass fraction, Schmidt number, and diffusion coefficient) related to this equation are easy to be tested. There are no assumptions and simplifications required for modelling the dispersion of tracer gas. Because of the lower complexity and less demand on user knowledge, it is easier for tracer gas simulation to obtain reliable results. This is especially important from the viewpoint of engineering practice."
        ],
        "4 Conclusion and future possibilities": [
            "Tracer gas is a suitable surrogate of exhaled droplet nuclei for studying airborne transmission in the built environment, because (a) if a disease is found to be transmitted via airborne route, it is mostly the fine droplet nuclei generated by human respiratory processes that are the vehicles of pathogens, and fine droplet nuclei have aerodynamics more close to a gas, (b) studies show that the movement of fine particles less than 3\u20135 \u03bcm can be well represented with tracer gas simulation, and (c) tracer gas simulation is of lower complexity and less demand on user knowledge and thus it is easier to obtain reliable results. Note that dispersion and deposition of droplet nuclei in the respiratory tract were not discussed in this paper.",
            "As reviewed, tracer gas simulation and particle simulation of droplet nuclei have different error sources. Few studies have evaluated quantitatively the error of particle simulation. It would be interesting to assess whether or not the error of tracer gas simulation is smaller than the error of particle simulation, when compared to the real-life dispersion of exhaled droplet nuclei. In addition, few studies have compared the dispersion characteristics of different tracer gases, and it is still unknown how different are the experimental results obtained by using different tracer gases (i.e., different densities, diffusion coefficients and Schmidt numbers). Further studies are required.",
            "Particle simulation of exhaled droplet nuclei may be necessary when the deposition becomes the dominating factor such as when the airflow passes through narrow passages (e.g., window or door gaps). In addition, particle simulation would potentially become an effective method for airborne transmission studies in the built environment, if (a) a particle generation system is developed for experimental studies to a level that the number and size distribution of the generated particles can be accurately controlled, (b) in experimental settings the factors including the background concentration that influence the measurement accuracy and repeatability can be conveniently eliminated, and (c) numerical models are advanced to be able to take into account the major dynamics and fates of particles."
