Total 14 articles were downloaded from the net and 10 to 20 times reads and conclusion was draw about this virus in China. The study indicates that Corona was spread from the Hunan Seafood market Wuhan Province and then spread in the whole world as SARS and MERS. Few cases by doctor in the start was identified in December in 2019 but the government has considered rumor in the country and warning were given to Doctor which was latter on died by this virus. Due to late advertisement by media the virus spread in the whole world and transfered to 33 countries which affected different number. The highest number was found in China 78966 followed by Diamond Princess where number of affectee was 691 while South Korea number was 602. The total death number was 2468 which was so high number than the SARS and MERS. Through this way the economy of China was highly damaged and countries boundaries were sealed while in and out were closed. Mostly the province of Wuhan and Hoebi were highly affected where the death number was 81 percent of the whole number. Canada, United stated and WHO helped in virus controlling. They give huge funds to China. The virus story is very complicated and the diagnosed was difficult. The shape of the virus was like crown while crown mean Corona, So its name was called corona. This virus has different form SARS, Ebola, Flu, MERS and Influenza. All were dangerous for body of human and all attacked mostly in the season of winter and damage the lungs and other tissue of the body. The virus is live in the body of bat but the immunity power is high and it cannot damage to bats. Similarly SARS and MERS live in the body of Covit and Camel while it do not damage to them. The main reason is temperature and immunity. So it is necessary for world expert to analyze the situation and check the temperature and immunity role in Corona virus control. All virus of flu, Ebola, SARS and MERS attacked in the winter season. So it is also necessary to keep the body of the affected person warm for this virus controlling. The bat and camel body temperature is also high, so there the virus affection is nil. Do the experiment on bat, camel and Covit why the virus do not affect their body On the basis of problems the review recommend that to keep the body of the affected person warm for its controlling; When touch animals then wash your hand with soap; Quarantine should be follow and keep constant in the country market; New hospital should be made for proper treatment; Face mask should be made in large number in the country; When some cases appeared then in time reported to concerned department for its treatment; Use more vegetables in daily life; Social talk should be closed when someone is affected by corona virus; All meat food should be cooked nicely. More fund should be kept for health problems solution in the country; Always speak truth and never propagate fake information in the world.; Always kept eye on animal and wash your hand in the time of animal contact.",
