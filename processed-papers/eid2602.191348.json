            "HEV-3 and HEV-4 are zoonotic viruses that infect pigs and humans. In this study, we found that \u224840% of US slaughterhouse pigs were seropositive for HEV, indicating prior HEV infection of the pigs on the farms, which was consistent with prior estimates for farmed US pigs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Despite the relatively high seropositivity, however, only a small proportion (6%) of the pigs had detectable HEV viremia, probably because HEV viremia is transient and thus the window for detecting HEV RNA in serum is narrow. In addition, active HEV infection occurs naturally in most farm pigs around 2 months of age [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Therefore, most marketweight pigs >6 months of age at the time of slaughter<br/><br/>Figure.

The phylogenetic analysis was performed by using MEGA6 software (http://www. megasoftware.net) and the maximum-likelihood bootstrap method based on the TamuraNei model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The figure represents a cladogram. The HEV-3abchij sequences belonging to HEV-3 group 2 (HEV-3\u20132) are highlighted in gray (n = 182 sequences from slaughterhouse pigs in this study; n = 19 reference sequences from the GenBank database). The HEV-3efg sequences belonging to HEV-3 group 1 (HEV-3\u20131) are shown on a white background (n = 7 reference sequences from the GenBank database). Reference HEV sequences from genotypes 1/2/4 clade of Orthohepevirus A, and Orthohepevirus B/C/D clade are also shown as collapsed branches, and the cutthroat trout virus within the genus Piscihepevirus is shown as a separate clade.

            "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA was detected in 6.3% and HEV IgG in 40% of 5,033 serum samples from marketweight pigs at 25 slaughterhouses in 10 US states. The prevalent HEV genotype was zoonotic genotype 3, group 2. Blood of HEV-viremic pigs from slaughterhouses may contaminate pork supply chains.",
            "Hepatitis E virus (HEV; family Hepeviridae, genus Orthohepevirus A) comprises at least 8 distinct genotypes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. In industrialized countries, swine HEV of the zoonotic genotypes 3 and 4 (HEV-3 and HEV4) is an emerging foodborne pathogen, transmitted by consumption of raw or undercooked pork [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Recently, HEV-3 has been detected in human blood donors in the United States [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. We previously showed that HEV-3 is present in US swine herds [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and that a small proportion of commercial pork products, such as liver and chitterlings, from US grocery stores contain infectious HEV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. However, the current HEV infection status of US market-weight pigs at the time of slaughter, the entry point to the food supply chain, remains unknown. We therefore investigated the presence of HEV RNA and HEV IgG prevalence in 5,033 serum samples from market-weight pigs at 25 slaughterhouses in 10 US states."

        "Conclusions": [
            "HEV-3 and HEV-4 are zoonotic viruses that infect pigs and humans. In this study, we found that \u224840% of US slaughterhouse pigs were seropositive for HEV, indicating prior HEV infection of the pigs on the farms, which was consistent with prior estimates for farmed US pigs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Despite the relatively high seropositivity, however, only a small proportion (6%) of the pigs had detectable HEV viremia, probably because HEV viremia is transient and thus the window for detecting HEV RNA in serum is narrow. In addition, active HEV infection occurs naturally in most farm pigs around 2 months of age [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Therefore, most marketweight pigs >6 months of age at the time of slaughter",

The phylogenetic analysis was performed by using MEGA6 software (http://www. megasoftware.net) and the maximum-likelihood bootstrap method based on the TamuraNei model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The figure represents a cladogram. The HEV-3abchij sequences belonging to HEV-3 group 2 (HEV-3\u20132) are highlighted in gray (n = 182 sequences from slaughterhouse pigs in this study; n = 19 reference sequences from the GenBank database). The HEV-3efg sequences belonging to HEV-3 group 1 (HEV-3\u20131) are shown on a white background (n = 7 reference sequences from the GenBank database). Reference HEV sequences from genotypes 1/2/4 clade of Orthohepevirus A, and Orthohepevirus B/C/D clade are also shown as collapsed branches, and the cutthroat trout virus within the genus Piscihepevirus is shown as a separate clade.

Nevertheless, studies have shown that 5.7% of UK [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], and 44.4% of Scotland [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] slaughterhouse market-weight pigs were viremic. A growing number of reported cases of autochthonous HEV-3 and HEV-4 human infection have been attributed to consumption of raw or undercooked pork [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], including 1 case acquired from imported HEV-4 in the United States [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "The HEV sequences we detected all belonged to the zoonotic HEV-3 group 2 (HEV-3abchij). This finding is consistent with previous reports of detection of HEV-3 in US farm pigs and commercial pork products [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Pigs in Europe are reportedly infected with HEV-3c, 3e, 3f, 3h, and 3i. Because our phylogenetic analysis was based on partial sequences, our results identified the prevalent HEV genotype at the group level, but more detailed study based on fulllength sequence is warranted to definitively identify viral heterogeneity as well as the molecular clock of HEV evolution across the United States. Cases of autochthonous human infection with HEV-3abchij have been reported in the United Kingdom [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], and low levels of HEV-3abchij RNA were detected in human blood donor plasma samples in the United States [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. That \u22486% of slaughterhouse pigs are still viremic for HEV-3abchij raises a potential concern about pork safety because blood containing infectious HEV during slaughter may contaminate raw pork products. Therefore, to prevent foodborne HEV infection, pork should be properly cooked before consumption; an internal temperature of 71\u00b0C inactivates infectious HEV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]."
