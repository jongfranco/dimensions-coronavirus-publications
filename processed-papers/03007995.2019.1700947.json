        "abstract": "Introduction: Antibiotics are indispensable to maintaining human health; however, their overuse has resulted in resistant organisms, increasing morbidity, mortality and costs. Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat, resulting in multiple campaigns across countries to improve appropriate antimicrobial use. This includes addressing the overuse of antimicrobials for selflimiting infections, such as upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), particularly in lower- and middleincome countries (LMICs) where there is the greatest inappropriate use and where antibiotic utilization has increased the most in recent years. Consequently, there is a need to document current practices and successful initiatives in LMICs to improve future antimicrobial use. Methodology: Documentation of current epidemiology and management of URTIs, particularly in LMICs, as well as campaigns to improve future antimicrobial use and their influence where known.",

            "Antibiotics are indispensable to maintaining human health; however, their overuse has resulted in resistant organisms, increasing morbidity, mortality and costs. Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat, resulting in multiple campaigns across countries to improve appropriate antimicrobial use. This includes addressing the overuse of antimicrobials for selflimiting infections, such as upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), particularly in lower- and middleincome countries (LMICs) where there is the greatest inappropriate use and where antibiotic utilization has increased the most in recent years. Consequently, there is a need to document current practices and successful initiatives in LMICs to improve future antimicrobial use. Methodology: Documentation of current epidemiology and management of URTIs, particularly in LMICs, as well as campaigns to improve future antimicrobial use and their influence where known.<br/><br/>ARTICLE HISTORY Received 7 August 2019 Revised 26 November 2019 Accepted 1 December 2019",
            "The development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major issue worldwide, associated with increasing morbidity, mortality and health care costs[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Globally, the irrational, indiscriminate, and excessive use of antibiotics, including for self-limiting infections, is a key driver of increasing AMR rates and a considerable public health concern[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. Such concerns are exacerbated by the spread of AMR from one geographic locality to others resulting in resistance to reserve antibiotics including colistin together with growing resistance to a number of organisms including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae growing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. As a result, bacteria causing severe health problems have become resistant to multiple antibiotics during the past 20\u201330 years[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. This overuse urgently needs addressing alongside the development and implementation of guidelines to restrict the use of key antibiotics as well as reduce their inappropriate use[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>].<br/><br/>High AMR rates are a particular issue in LMICs, exacerbated by poor hygiene, malnutrition and overcrowded living conditions, lack of adequate infrastructures and pressure by patients and carers on physicians to prescribe antibiotics and on pharmacists to dispense them without a prescription[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>]. Unfortunately, antibiotics can achieve good health outcomes even in patients with viral infections, which runs counter to changing public perceptions of their efficacy[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. Concerns with rising rates of AMR, coupled with the continued irrational use of antibiotics to treat self-limiting infections such as upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), have resulted in multiple initiatives internationally, regionally, and nationally aimed at reversing current trends[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>]."

            "Much concern remains regarding the prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics for URTIs among LMICs. This includes considerable self-purchasing, up to 100% of pharmacies in some LMICs. However, multiple activities are now ongoing to improve future use. These incorporate educational initiatives among all key stakeholder groups, as well as legislation and other activities to reduce self-purchasing as part of National Action Plans (NAPs). Further activities are still needed however. These include increased physician and pharmacist education, starting in medical and pharmacy schools; greater monitoring of prescribing and dispensing practices, including the development of pertinent quality indicators; and targeted patient information and health education campaigns. It is recognized that such activities are more challenging in LMICs given more limited resources and a lack of healthcare professionals. Conclusion: Initiatives will grow across LMICs to reduce inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobials for URTIs as part of NAPs and other activities, and these will be monitored.",
            "The aetiology of URTIs and their symptoms will first be discussed, followed by known prevalence rates for URTIs and factors influencing their prescribing to provide background, before discussing the management of URTIs in LMICs, including non-prescription sales. This will be followed by documenting and debating potential strategies to reduce the irrational use of antibiotics to treat URTIs in LMICs to provide future direction.<br/><br/>3.1.

The principal invading viruses include the human rhinovirus/ enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, the parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus and the H1N1 flu virus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c185\" href=\"#r185\">185</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c187\" href=\"#r187\">187</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c190\" href=\"#r190\">190</a>]. However, there can be bacterial involvement, including Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c138\" href=\"#r138\">138</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c185\" href=\"#r185\">185</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c188\" href=\"#r188\">188</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c191\" href=\"#r191\">191</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c193\" href=\"#r193\">193</a>].<br/><br/>URTIs are often reported as a minor health problem[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c184\" href=\"#r184\">184</a>]. For instance, the common cold is viral in origin and generally mild and self-limiting, with patients typically improving within 7 to 10 days of onset[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c99\" href=\"#r99\">99</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c189\" href=\"#r189\">189</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c194\" href=\"#r194\">194</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c195\" href=\"#r195\">195</a>]. Children of six years or below are the most vulnerable group to develop a common cold, typically having six to eight cold episodes per year, whereas adults typically have only two to three common colds a year[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c189\" href=\"#r189\">189</a>]. Smokers generally suffer the symptoms of URTIs for longer than non-smokers[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c194\" href=\"#r194\">194</a>]."

This approach has been used successfully to stimulate debate in other priority healthcare areas to provide future guidance[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c161\" href=\"#r161\">161</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c171\" href=\"#r171\">171</a>].<br/><br/>The 2018 World Bank classification was used to break countries down into LMICs or upper income countries where applicable[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c172\" href=\"#r172\">172</a>] (Supplementary Table A). Upper income countries are only commented on where pertinent. This is because typically there are different practices, cultural beliefs as well as greater availability of healthcare professionals in higher income countries. In addition in LMICs, the costs of medicines can account for up to 70% of total healthcare expenditure, much of which is out of pocket[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c173\" href=\"#r173\">173</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c175\" href=\"#r175\">175</a>].

Such practices need to be urgently addressed to reduce rising AMR rates.<br/><br/>The major drivers of inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics for RTIs include (i) variable knowledge among patients, prescribers and dispensing staff regarding antibiotics and AMR; (ii) limited knowledge regarding current antibiotic utilization patterns and resistance rates, especially for patients with URTIs in a number of countries; (iii) lack of ASPs in ambulatory care; (iv) pressure from patients and caregivers to prescribe and/or dispense antibiotics because of their beliefs surrounding antibiotics, (v) profit motive and concerns among pharmacists coupled with a lack of enforcement of legislation banning the self-purchasing of antibiotics for URTIs where this is a concern; (vi) lower socioeconomic status in LMICs with issues of overcrowding and malnutrition; and (vii) long waiting times to see health professionals in PHCs in a number of LMICs.<br/><br/>Multiple strategies are needed to improve the future prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics among all key stakeholder groups for a patient with URTIs. These include additional education and training for physicians where pertinent, incorporating enhanced communication with patients, closer monitoring of the prescribing of antibiotics for URTIs, and the instigation of relevant quality indicators. Educational initiatives are also needed where pertinent for community pharmacists along with the instigation of guidelines for patients with URTIs, greater tracking of antibiotics through the supply chain and the instigation and enforcement of policies to reduce inappropriate self-purchasing of antibiotics where pertinent. As these activities progress, AMR rates should start to reduce. Health education activities among patients and the public are also needed to supplement activities with physicians and pharmacists. Such activities should principally centre around communicating that URTIs are predominantly viral in origin and self-limiting, therefore antibiotics are often inappropriate."

            "Antibiotics are indispensable to maintaining human health; however, their overuse has resulted in resistant organisms, increasing morbidity, mortality and costs. Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat, resulting in multiple campaigns across countries to improve appropriate antimicrobial use. This includes addressing the overuse of antimicrobials for selflimiting infections, such as upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), particularly in lower- and middleincome countries (LMICs) where there is the greatest inappropriate use and where antibiotic utilization has increased the most in recent years. Consequently, there is a need to document current practices and successful initiatives in LMICs to improve future antimicrobial use. Methodology: Documentation of current epidemiology and management of URTIs, particularly in LMICs, as well as campaigns to improve future antimicrobial use and their influence where known.",

            "Much concern remains regarding the prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics for URTIs among LMICs. This includes considerable self-purchasing, up to 100% of pharmacies in some LMICs. However, multiple activities are now ongoing to improve future use. These incorporate educational initiatives among all key stakeholder groups, as well as legislation and other activities to reduce self-purchasing as part of National Action Plans (NAPs). Further activities are still needed however. These include increased physician and pharmacist education, starting in medical and pharmacy schools; greater monitoring of prescribing and dispensing practices, including the development of pertinent quality indicators; and targeted patient information and health education campaigns. It is recognized that such activities are more challenging in LMICs given more limited resources and a lack of healthcare professionals. Conclusion: Initiatives will grow across LMICs to reduce inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobials for URTIs as part of NAPs and other activities, and these will be monitored."

        "1. Introduction": [
            "The development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major issue worldwide, associated with increasing morbidity, mortality and health care costs[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Globally, the irrational, indiscriminate, and excessive use of antibiotics, including for self-limiting infections, is a key driver of increasing AMR rates and a considerable public health concern[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. Such concerns are exacerbated by the spread of AMR from one geographic locality to others resulting in resistance to reserve antibiotics including colistin together with growing resistance to a number of organisms including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae growing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. As a result, bacteria causing severe health problems have become resistant to multiple antibiotics during the past 20\u201330 years[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. This overuse urgently needs addressing alongside the development and implementation of guidelines to restrict the use of key antibiotics as well as reduce their inappropriate use[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>].",
            "High AMR rates are a particular issue in LMICs, exacerbated by poor hygiene, malnutrition and overcrowded living conditions, lack of adequate infrastructures and pressure by patients and carers on physicians to prescribe antibiotics and on pharmacists to dispense them without a prescription[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>]. Unfortunately, antibiotics can achieve good health outcomes even in patients with viral infections, which runs counter to changing public perceptions of their efficacy[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. Concerns with rising rates of AMR, coupled with the continued irrational use of antibiotics to treat self-limiting infections such as upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), have resulted in multiple initiatives internationally, regionally, and nationally aimed at reversing current trends[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>].",
            "URTIs, which include infections of the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx with the subglottic area of the trachea, are the most common infections seen in ambulatory care[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>]. The majority of these infections are viral in origin, involving any part [more or less] of the upper respiratory tract[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>], and will typically resolve without the use of antibiotics[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>]. Consequently, the inappropriate use of antibiotics in respiratory tract infections (RTIs) will appreciably enhance AMR rates, with antimicrobial use in RTIs currently seen as the greatest misuse of antimicrobials worldwide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c96\" href=\"#r96\">96</a>].",
            "Sub-optimal management of URTIs in LMICs including the overuse of antibiotics is promoted by misconceptions, socialcultural issues, diagnostic uncertainty, and clinical competency as well as commercial, patient and time pressures[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c96\" href=\"#r96\">96</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c109\" href=\"#r109\">109</a>]. Inappropriate management is also a concern in countries with high rates of infectious diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis (TB), which is the case in sub-Saharan Africa, as this may complicate treatment[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c110\" href=\"#r110\">110</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c112\" href=\"#r112\">112</a>]. Certain antibiotics temporarily suppress symptoms of TB, leading to delays in diagnosis and patients potentially receiving several antibiotics due to the wrong clinical diagnosis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c113\" href=\"#r113\">113</a>]. Ideally, patients with TB should be referred by pharmacists to specialists if patients first visit them. However, such activities can be very variable and may depend on whether patients have suspected or confirmed TB113,114. Development of AMR in patients with RTIs and other underlying infectious diseases can increase morbidity and mortality; consequently, antibiotic use in such patients needs to be carefully managed[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c115\" href=\"#r115\">115</a>].",
            "In light of growing AMR rates and the implications of this, there is an urgent need to review key issues relating to the use of antibiotics for patients with URTIs as well as potential strategies to reduce irrational use to guide future activities. This is because a considerable proportion of antibiotics prescribed and dispensed worldwide are in ambulatory care, and, as mentioned, predominantly for URTIs21,82,85,88,90,116\u2013118. There is also a need to focus on LMICs, including sub-Saharan Africa, because infectious disease rates are higher in LMICs than in developed countries, there is extensive self-purchasing of antibiotics in LMICs because of their relatively easy availability, and issues surrounding their inappropriate use have been less well researched and understood in LMICs compared with higher income countries[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c100\" href=\"#r100\">100</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c104\" href=\"#r104\">104</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c119\" href=\"#r119\">119</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c124\" href=\"#r124\">124</a>]. A considerably higher percentage of patients with URTIs are inappropriately treated in LMICs compared with high-income countries[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>]. In addition, much of the increase in antibiotic consumption in recent years has been in LMICs including Brazil, China, India and South Africa[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c125\" href=\"#r125\">125</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c127\" href=\"#r127\">127</a>]. Overall between 2000 and 2015, worldwide consumption of antibiotics increased by 65%, driven principally by increased rates in LMICs11,12.",
            "Self-purchasing of antibiotics, sometimes referred to as \u2018non-prescription sales\u2019, can be a particular concern in terms of the accuracy of diagnosis and the over-use of antibiotics, enhanced by issues of accessibility, affordability (i.e. whether patients can afford to see both a physician and purchase their medicines) and economic benefits. In some situations, pharmacists are the only healthcare professionals available to patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c128\" href=\"#r128\">128</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c141\" href=\"#r141\">141</a>]. Self-purchasing of antimicrobials is particularly problematic in LMICs compared with high income countries[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c120\" href=\"#r120\">120</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c121\" href=\"#r121\">121</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c123\" href=\"#r123\">123</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c142\" href=\"#r142\">142</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c143\" href=\"#r143\">143</a>].",
            "In response to these issues, the principal objective of this paper is to document and debate key issues surrounding antibiotic use, including misuse, in ambulatory care patients with URTIs in LMICs to provide future guidance. This includes identifying and building on suggested activities from the published literature supplemented by knowledge and experience from key senior personnel working in this area across LMICs. We do not consider the quality of available antibiotics in this paper, which have resulted in concerns with generic antibiotics and/or counterfeit medicines, as these issues have been extensively explored elsewhere[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c144\" href=\"#r144\">144</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c148\" href=\"#r148\">148</a>]. Neither do we consider antibiotic availability, which can also be a concern in LMICs149. The key issue discussed in this paper is the identification of potential ways to reduce rising AMR rates given the high global priority via the appropriate management of URTIs in LMICs29,88,125,150.",
            "We are aware that an appreciable number of publications and ongoing research already exist discussing potential ways to improve antibiotic utilization especially in LMICs, which includes improved surveillance[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c100\" href=\"#r100\">100</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c119\" href=\"#r119\">119</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c120\" href=\"#r120\">120</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c151\" href=\"#r151\">151</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c152\" href=\"#r152\">152</a>]. A number of systematic reviews regarding the management of URTIs and ways to improve both the prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics for patients with URTIs have also been published[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c108\" href=\"#r108\">108</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c153\" href=\"#r153\">153</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c154\" href=\"#r154\">154</a>].

In addition, initiatives such as GRIP (Global Respiratory Infection Partnership Declaration) help reduce unnecessary antibiotic utilization through recommending non-antibiotic treatments for patients with URTIs158,159. However, we believe to date there have not been any publications that have comprehensively focused on all aspects of prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics for URTIs in LMICs, which can be very different to high-income countries with different practices and beliefs. In addition, few reviews have contextualized the findings from multiple authors from a wide range of LMICs to provide future guidance building on WHO and other international initiatives. We believe therefore that our findings and the implications should be of interest to all key stakeholders in LMICs seeking ways to improve antibiotic utilization among their patients with URTIs."

Upper income countries are only commented on where pertinent. This is because typically there are different practices, cultural beliefs as well as greater availability of healthcare professionals in higher income countries. In addition in LMICs, the costs of medicines can account for up to 70% of total healthcare expenditure, much of which is out of pocket[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c173\" href=\"#r173\">173</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c175\" href=\"#r175\">175</a>].

The principal invading viruses include the human rhinovirus/ enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, the parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus and the H1N1 flu virus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c185\" href=\"#r185\">185</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c187\" href=\"#r187\">187</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c190\" href=\"#r190\">190</a>]. However, there can be bacterial involvement, including Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c138\" href=\"#r138\">138</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c185\" href=\"#r185\">185</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c188\" href=\"#r188\">188</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c191\" href=\"#r191\">191</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c193\" href=\"#r193\">193</a>].",
            "URTIs are often reported as a minor health problem[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c184\" href=\"#r184\">184</a>]. For instance, the common cold is viral in origin and generally mild and self-limiting, with patients typically improving within 7 to 10 days of onset[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c99\" href=\"#r99\">99</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c189\" href=\"#r189\">189</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c194\" href=\"#r194\">194</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c195\" href=\"#r195\">195</a>]. Children of six years or below are the most vulnerable group to develop a common cold, typically having six to eight cold episodes per year, whereas adults typically have only two to three common colds a year[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c189\" href=\"#r189\">189</a>]. Smokers generally suffer the symptoms of URTIs for longer than non-smokers[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c194\" href=\"#r194\">194</a>].",
            "Typically, a medical consultation is not needed for URTIs if symptoms resolve within ten days URTIs are frequently viral in origin, generally self-limiting and hardly ever life-threatening[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c196\" href=\"#r196\">196</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c197\" href=\"#r197\">197</a>]. However, some children can develop pneumonia, which requires hospitalization and specialized treatment[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c198\" href=\"#r198\">198</a>]. Despite URTIs generally being minor illnesses, they result in an appreciable number of medical consultations globally[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c199\" href=\"#r199\">199</a>\u2013203]. The number of healthcare consultations combined with parental and patient pressure increases antibiotic use for URTIs including LMICs thereby increasing AMR rates[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c153\" href=\"#r153\">153</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c200\" href=\"#r200\">200</a>,204\u2013209]. Patients or parents who are concerned about their or their child\u2019s respiratory illness are likely to seek treatment, and want an antibiotic, especially if they perceive the illness as severe[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,209,210]. As mentioned, extra care is needed for patients with underlying infectious diseases such as HIV, malaria and TB, especially in tropical countries. These infections may compound the diagnosis and treatment of URTIs, particularly where no laboratory facilities for definitive diagnosis are available. For example, a study undertaken in Kenya in a malaria endemic zone at the peak malaria infection period demonstrated a high rate of viral respiratory tract infections (52%) among children suspected of having malaria using clinical symptoms only[211]. These children are more likely to be treated for malaria than URTIs as it was demonstrated they had gained immunity to plasmodium parasites by being in a malaria endemic zone[211]."

Overall, the incidence and prevalence of URTIs varies considerably across and within countries and across age groups, although children from newborn to four years are at the highest risk of developing a URTI69,188,213\u2013218. Females may be at more risk of developing URTIs than males; however, this is not always the case and may depend on the patient\u2019s age[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c189\" href=\"#r189\">189</a>,213,215,219]."

However, rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) for GABHS take only 5 to 10 min to perform and can reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing[222]. Consequently, their use is likely to grow in the future[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c152\" href=\"#r152\">152</a>]. Alternatively, clinical scoring systems such as FeverPAIN or Centor criteria help to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for acute sore throats, including acute pharyngitis[223,224]."

            "Ideally, physicians should consider multiple issues when treating patients with URTIs including the potential use, delayed use or misuse of antibiotics[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c151\" href=\"#r151\">151</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c192\" href=\"#r192\">192</a>,225\u2013227]. This is especially important as there is no perceived clinical benefit from the use of antibiotics in the treatment of URTIs in many patients, including those with a common cold or persistent acute purulent rhinitis, with evidence of significant adverse events in adults from antibiotics[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>,228].",

For example, Holloway et al found in their recent review that the rates of treating URTIs inappropriately in children in LMICs were high, with the use of antibiotics ranging from 42\u201372% of patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>], and Ahiabu et al found that 86.4% of patients with URTIs attending primary healthcare facilities in Ghana were prescribed an antibiotic[231].

Having said this, there have been low rates of non-prescription sales of antibiotics in some LMICs in the past. For example, in a study of community pharmacists in Zimbabwe published in 2007, the authors found that the majority of pharmacists (69%) stated that they would never sell an antibiotic without a prescription and very few did despite high patient demand[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c115\" href=\"#r115\">115</a>].

Amoxicillin, cephalexin, and azithromycin were the most commonly sold antibiotics before the legislation (December 2009 to November 2010) and after (December 2010 to November 2011).  Sales of amoxicillin fell by approximately 30% post legislation despite the general growth in the pharmaceutical market, with falls in sales for the tetracyclines (-30.5%), sulfonamides (-28.5%), and macrolides (-25%). This showed a positive impact of the new legislation on antibiotic sales in private pharmacies in Brazil.  Decreased amoxicillin consumption is important as amoxicillin is often associated with selfmedication and self-purchasing for the treatment of URTIs.",

Nevertheless, published studies agree that increased monitoring of antibiotic utilization is needed to further enhance the appropriate use of antibiotics in Brazil including for URTIs, thereby helping to reduce AMR rates in the future275.  Cross-sectional study among selected pharmacies in Nairobi.  Monitoring of antibiotic dispensing among pharmacies allied to the University of Nairobi showed a low level of dispensing of antibiotics without a prescription, with 94.1% of antibiotics dispensed with a valid prescription.  No antibiotics were prescribed or dispensed for patients with a common cold or influenza, with overthe-counter (OTC) medications such as cough and cold syrups and lozenges often dispensed.  In a survey involving 100 households in Namibia, the authors found that patients regularly selfmedicated for themselves or their children for acute respiratory infections, including for common colds and influenza.  However, this was typically with cold/flu medication, paracetamol and decongestants, rather than antibiotics.  This is helped by regulations banning the self-purchasing of antibiotics with community pharmacies regularly monitored.  Observational, cross-sectional study involving community pharmacists across all regions to assess the influence of a series of interventions in recent years (Table 2) including guidelines for pharmacists and greater enforcement of the regulations banning self-purchasing of antibiotics  This resulted in the self-purchasing of antibiotics for self-diagnosed URTIs significantly decreasing from",

QIs can range from general QIs based on the class of antibiotics prescribed (Supplementary Box A) to more specific indicators based on actual prescribing. Slovenia has also instigated several QIs to enhance the prescribing of antibiotics, including those for URTIs (Supplementary Box B). The general QIs (Supplementary Box A) reflect the concerns of the WHO and others regarding the over use of co-amoxiclav, fluoroquinolones, third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, macrolides and glycopeptides.

            "The major drivers of inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics for RTIs include (i) variable knowledge among patients, prescribers and dispensing staff regarding antibiotics and AMR; (ii) limited knowledge regarding current antibiotic utilization patterns and resistance rates, especially for patients with URTIs in a number of countries; (iii) lack of ASPs in ambulatory care; (iv) pressure from patients and caregivers to prescribe and/or dispense antibiotics because of their beliefs surrounding antibiotics, (v) profit motive and concerns among pharmacists coupled with a lack of enforcement of legislation banning the self-purchasing of antibiotics for URTIs where this is a concern; (vi) lower socioeconomic status in LMICs with issues of overcrowding and malnutrition; and (vii) long waiting times to see health professionals in PHCs in a number of LMICs.",
            "Multiple strategies are needed to improve the future prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics among all key stakeholder groups for a patient with URTIs. These include additional education and training for physicians where pertinent, incorporating enhanced communication with patients, closer monitoring of the prescribing of antibiotics for URTIs, and the instigation of relevant quality indicators. Educational initiatives are also needed where pertinent for community pharmacists along with the instigation of guidelines for patients with URTIs, greater tracking of antibiotics through the supply chain and the instigation and enforcement of policies to reduce inappropriate self-purchasing of antibiotics where pertinent. As these activities progress, AMR rates should start to reduce. Health education activities among patients and the public are also needed to supplement activities with physicians and pharmacists. Such activities should principally centre around communicating that URTIs are predominantly viral in origin and self-limiting, therefore antibiotics are often inappropriate.",
            "Suggested strategies to improve the prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics for URTIs among LMICs are based on the findings in Section 3.4 coupled with the knowledge and practice of the multiple co-authors. These have been divided into short- and long-term initiatives (Table 5)."
