            "In Chapter 23, Sanghee Park addresses the politics and governance of public sector organizations including state-owned enterprises and quasi-government agencies in terms of organizational changes, personnel management, performance, and financial management. After presenting a broad overview of public-sector organizations in Korea, Park explores structural changes and continuities focused on the political costs of termination, the politics of political appointment of different types of executives, and the impact of politicization of boards on organizational performance. Finally, Park discusses public sector debt as an outcome of the financial vicious circle created by the soft budget constraint."
