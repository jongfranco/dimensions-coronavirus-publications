        "abstract": "Enterprise resilience is a key capacity to guarantee enterprises\u2019 long-term continuity. This paper proposes the enterprise resilience Conceptual Reference Framework to characterize enterprise resilience capacity. The framework is composed of 71 disruptive events that enterprises consider as endangerments to their continuity. The framework also comprises constituent capabilities of enterprise resilience in terms of preparedness and recovery capabilities and elements that support the transition from the AS IS situation to the TO BE one, which are preventive actions (for preparedness capability) and knowledge registration actions (for recovery capability). From the preparedness perspective, 403 preventive actions are currently defined. Each preventive action is specific for every disruptive event. However, it is worth noting that a preventive action can also be applied to different disruptive events. From the recovery perspective, the proposed framework indicates knowledge registration related to (i) the occurrence of disruptive events; (ii) the recovery actions performed to re-establish the normal enterprise operation level. Further research lines are addressed to develop quantitative methods and tools to assess the extent of enterprises\u2019 resilience following the foundations of the proposed conceptual framework.",

            "Currently, industries have to face challenges and continuous changes given their own dynamism as well as the changing conditions of the environment in which they operate. Moreover, the current businesses complexity, due to the vast amount of physical and information transactions performed to guarantee that goods are manufactured according to consumer specifications and in the appropriate quantity to be delivered on time and in the right place cost-efficiently, has made industries more sensitive to disruptive events [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. For this reason, companies are increasingly demanding responsibility to deal with such adversity.

            "Abstract: Enterprise resilience is a key capacity to guarantee enterprises\u2019 long-term continuity. This paper proposes the enterprise resilience Conceptual Reference Framework to characterize enterprise resilience capacity. The framework is composed of 71 disruptive events that enterprises consider as endangerments to their continuity. The framework also comprises constituent capabilities of enterprise resilience in terms of preparedness and recovery capabilities and elements that support the transition from the AS IS situation to the TO BE one, which are preventive actions (for preparedness capability) and knowledge registration actions (for recovery capability). From the preparedness perspective, 403 preventive actions are currently defined. Each preventive action is specific for every disruptive event. However, it is worth noting that a preventive action can also be applied to different disruptive events. From the recovery perspective, the proposed framework indicates knowledge registration related to (i) the occurrence of disruptive events; (ii) the recovery actions performed to re-establish the normal enterprise operation level. Further research lines are addressed to develop quantitative methods and tools to assess the extent of enterprises\u2019 resilience following the foundations of the proposed conceptual framework.",

            "Currently, industries have to face challenges and continuous changes given their own dynamism as well as the changing conditions of the environment in which they operate. Moreover, the current businesses complexity, due to the vast amount of physical and information transactions performed to guarantee that goods are manufactured according to consumer specifications and in the appropriate quantity to be delivered on time and in the right place cost-efficiently, has made industries more sensitive to disruptive events [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. For this reason, companies are increasingly demanding responsibility to deal with such adversity. They usually entrust safety and insurance professionals who have risk management and business continuity backgrounds to deal with disruptive events. However, global and aggregate perspectives of resilience are not usually considered. Thus, building resilient enterprises seems necessary by designing an iterative process for long-term organization development and not only as a crisis management tool to face specific disruptions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. There are numerous case studies in the literature that provide details of the survival or the failure of enterprises in situations of crisis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], but, at first glance, no universal standards that ensure resilient capacity to face disruptive events are apparently available.",

            "In line with all this, two well-known case studies were analyzed in the literature that highlight the importance of enterprise resilience (ER). One is that described by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]: on Friday night, 17 March 2000, lightning struck a Philips industrial building, starting a fire. Philips announced an expected one week delay to Nokia and Ericsson, its main customers. The responses of both companies were very different. Nokia informed a troubleshooter who was working on this issue. The chips supplied by Philips were identified. Nokia found alternative suppliers for three of the five chips and used the overproduction capacity of other Philips plants. Ericsson assumed that chips would be delivered with some delay. However, Philips announced that it would take weeks to restart production and perhaps months to catch up on its production schedule. The different degrees of resilience in the response of both companies resulted in Nokia\u2019s share of handset market increasing from 27 to 30%, while Ericsson\u2019s dropped from 12 to 9%. The other case study was described by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]: after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, the U.S government closed the country\u2019s borders and shut down all incoming and outgoing flights. The impact on many supply lines was disastrous. For instance, Ford Motor Co. had to idle several assembly lines occasionally as the trucks loaded with components were late coming in from Canada and Mexico. This resulted in a 13% decrease in Ford\u2019s fourth-quarter output in 2001 compared to its production plan. Nevertheless, there are more examples and evidence from the business world that reveal the relevance of ER, e.g.,: in 1996, 3000 workers, United Auto Workers Union members, went on strike at two General Motors production plants in Dayton (Ohio), which interrupted production with very negative effects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]; in 1997, Boeing experienced supplier delivery failure of two critical parts with an estimated loss for the company of $2.6 billion [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]; in 2002, the 10 day closure of 29 ports in the U.S meant a cost to the economy of $1 billion a day [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], among others. Currently, coronavirus is disrupting business across sectors.",
            "The resilience concept was first proposed in the field of ecology by Holling [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], who defined it as: (A) a system (ecosystem, society, or organization) that persists in a state of equilibrium (stability) and as; (B) how dynamic systems behave when they are stressed and moved from this equilibrium. In this definition, the need for perseverance is emphasized as a measure of systems\u2019 persistence and their ability to absorb disruptions and maintain the same relationships among systems\u2019 entities. From the stability standpoint, emphasis is placed on maintaining equilibrium in a predictable context and the accumulation of excess resources in the system to maintain that balance. The view of stability is, therefore, defined as a system\u2019s ability to return to a state of equilibrium after disruption [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The resilience concept has been widely discussed in the literature in many fields [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], including psychology, materials science, communication and computational networks, sociology, infrastructures, cyber systems, and tourism, among others.

            "In their review, Kamalahmadi and Parast [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] addressed enterprises and supply chains and define the directions for future research as regards resilience aspects. They conclude that it is critical to develop measures that can evaluate supply chain (SC) resilience. Limnios et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] state that organizational resilience has been inadequately theorized, and related work appears scattered in the literature. In light of this, the need to define a conceptual reference framework as a first step to continue investigating ER and to fulfil some further research lines suggested by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] is recognized. One of the gaps identified in the literature is lack of tools to quantify ER capacity and to make its measurement easier for enterprises. Some attempts have been made to assess the capacity of resilience in the literature [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>].

Moreover, whether they focus mainly on the enterprise level or the SC level is indicated.",
            "To the best of our knowledge, only a few conceptual approaches for assessing and enhancing the resilience capacity have been identified [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. The study of previous contributions evidences that they have been specially defined by taking into account certain specificities. Apart from the previous analysis, the only contribution that has completed the cycle by defining a conceptual approach and, based on it, proposed a set of metrics and a tool, is [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. By measuring vulnerabilities factors such as turbulence, deliberate threats, external pressures, and resource limits, among others, and capabilities factors such as flexibility, efficiency, visibility, and adaptability, among others, the tool entitled Supply Chain Resilience Assessment and Management (SCRAMTM) can provide an evaluation of an SC\u2019s current level of resilience. However, as the authors point out, industry-specific or even firmor product-level particularities may require the definition of more specialized metrics. Although the previous tool sheds light on measuring resilience, this area is not fully developed and warrants further research. On the one hand, a generic conceptual reference framework is required to guarantee that it can be generally applied but, on the other hand, a detailed approach is also necessary to cover all the characteristics of industry and/or firms.",

Firstly, the proposed framework should guarantee the coverage of any disruptive event (that must be generic enough to be applied to any specific industry domain) and should, at the same time, consider the particularities and the casuistry of particular cases to improve resilience capacity. Moreover, lack of assessment tools to quantify the degree of ER acts as a trigger to define this conceptual reference framework, which may be used to develop tools that facilitate enterprises to practically assess ER capacity. To do so, it is necessary to establish the skeleton that structures all the elements that influence ER capacity. In this way, the ER conceptual reference framework involves three main elements: disruptions, the elements that negatively affect this capacity; the constituent capabilities of ER, in terms of preparedness and recovery capabilities; the elements supporting the transition from the AS IS situation to the TO BE one, which are preventive actions (for preparedness capability) and knowledge registration actions (for recovery capability)."

Twenty-two preventive actions were eliminated, as they were classified as not interesting. This left a conceptual reference framework with 403 preventive actions. However, it should be noted that the same preventive action can apply to several disruptive events and, therefore, this left 312 different preventive actions.

            "In this research, disruptions were considered to be either foreseeable or unforeseeable situations that negatively affect an enterprise\u2019s normal operation and stability. The theoretical framework must include the widest possible range of disruptive events that negatively influence enterprises\u2019 operation.",
            "Assumption B: Prevention against disruptions guarantees the enterprise\u2019s long-term overall operation.",
            "In the literature, we found prevention, anticipation, and avoidance synonymously. Reference [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] highlights that enterprises should anticipate the occurrence of disruptions and prepare their SCs for any expected and unexpected changes in the environment.",
            "Melnyk et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>] state that the preparedness capacity is composed of four phases, the first of which is avoidance, if at all possible, of the disruption occurring. Moreover, there are definitions of ER that explicitly encourage prevention to guarantee business continuity, such as \u201cthe capacity to anticipate unsafe and unexpected events for organizational survival in the face of threats, including the prevention or mitigation of failures in the systems\u201d [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>].",

Ponomarov and Holcomb [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>] place much emphasis on the efficient and effective response of enterprises to be able to recover to their original state or to improve their state after disruption. Moreover, the proposed conceptual reference framework is also based on the notion that enterprises with high preparedness and recovery capabilities will be more resilient.",
            "Enterprises that encourage proactive strategies will be more prepared to face expected\u2014but also unexpected\u2014events, which will confer enhanced ER. Moreover, if enterprises have well-defined recovery strategies and actions plans, when a disruption is inevitable, they will recover from that negative situation more resiliently.",

            "In the literature, no unanimity has been reached about the most appropriate term to designate disruption as concepts such as crisis, perturbation, uncertainty, risk, etc., which are used synonymously [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c68\" href=\"#r68\">68</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>]. Likewise, the literature review revealed that no consensus has been reached on the terms to designate disruption, their causes or sources, along with their consequences, impact, or effects. All terms are sometimes used with the same meaning, which can lead to much confusion. For example, a fire in a supplier (where the supplier\u2019s production system is actually damaged) that has to deliver components to a customer may be considered the reason (source) why the customer does not receive components in time, as it delayed the delivery of components (the disruptive event for the customer), whose long-term consequences may involve interrupting the customer\u2019s production system. However, from the supplier\u2019s point of view, the fire is both the source and the disruptive event at the same time because it is the cause of and the origin by which the supplier also interrupts its production with delays for delivering components (Table 5). For this reason, it is important to characterize disruptions and to classify clearly and concisely: what actually causes disruptions (source), what exactly the disruptive events are, and what their consequences are.",

            "Level: the level of a disruption is related to the different segments in which a disruptive event occurs.

Aspects such as natural phenomena, political factors, etc., are also categorized at the extra-enterprise level [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>].",

For these authors, a disruptive event is considered to be any alteration in the flow of materials, monetary, information, etc., that interrupts the enterprise\u2019s normal operational conditions and thus makes it vulnerable by reducing its performance and competitiveness. However, in the present research work, a disruptive event is a foreseeable or unforeseeable event that affects an enterprise\u2019s usual operation and stability but does not necessarily interrupt its activities. Currently, the conceptual reference framework is composed of a collection of 71 disruptive events classified according to the previous 11 origins of disruption sources.",

Sheffi and Rice [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] explain that the effects of any significant disruptive event cause loss of business performance. The disruptive events effects could be of diverse natures. The Business Continuity Institute, in its annual resilience survey [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>], points out that the most important consequences in order of their importance are: loss of productivity, customer complaints, increased production costs, loss of revenue, poor services prevision, stakeholder concern, reputational, image and brand damage, delays in delivering products, delays in cash flows, withdrawal of products, expected increase in regulations, scrutiny, loss of regular customers, payment of service credits, fines due to repeated breaches, and loss in share prices.",
            "The understanding of disruption consequences has progressed following the works of scholars such as Sanchis and Poler [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>], who developed a categorization framework of disruptions in which the consequences of disruptive events are classified as: (i) business interruption; (ii) damage to reputation/brand; (iii) delays to and failed due dates; (iv) failure to attract or retain top talent; (v) failure to meet customer needs; (vi) high inventories; (vii) impossibility to pay personnel, suppliers, taxes; (viii) increase in final product prices; (ix) increased production costs; (x) injury to end customers; (xi) injury to workers; (xii) loss of intellectual property/data; (xiii) loss of networked communication; (xiv) physical damage; (xv) reduced sales; (xvi) understaffing; (xvii) unfulfilled orders. The conceptual reference framework is built on the bases defined by these authors as their classification involves the most usual and easy ones to understand and quantify (by companies) consequences.",
            "Finally, it is noteworthy that there is also much confusion in the literature about differentiating disruption sources, disruptive events, and their consequences. Some authors point out that, for example, a company\u2019s bad reputation is a disruptive event. However, in the present research work, a company\u2019s bad image is not a disruptive event per se, but the consequence of some adverse situations that have occurred and have damaged the company\u2019s image."

Aspects such as anticipation and preparation, adaptation, and recovery are used in the different ER definitions in Table 2. These aspects are related to the resilience capabilities identified by Ponomarov et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>]: (i) disposition and preparation; (ii) response and adaptation; (iii) recovery or adjustment.",

Bhamra et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>] state that the resilience concept is both multidisciplinary and multifaceted; multidisciplinary because different areas manage the resilience applied to their knowledge domains, as defined in the convergent approach by Caralli et al (2010); multifaceted because resilience comprises different capacities, such as the capacities of preparedness, adaptation, and recovery. Ponomarov et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>] also consider the resilience concept to be multidimensional and multidisciplinary. Mitroff et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>] assert that resilient enterprises are proactive and, thanks to their preparation and anticipation, they rebound better from difficulties. Ivanov et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>] highlight two main basic approaches to hedging SCs against negative impacts of different disruptions: (i) proactive approaches to create certain protections and to take possible perturbations into account without recovery considerations; (ii) reactive approaches that aim to adjust SC processes and structures in the presence of unexpected events. However, resilience is not only supported by preparedness and recovery capabilities but also implies adaptation to flexibly change and adjusting to new circumstances.",

This way of thinking also affects companies. These authors state that, when individuals receive information about how prepared he/she is to deal with a specific disruptive event, they overestimate their potential to cope with it. In most cases, input information does not cause, as would be desirable, the activation of appropriate measures to improve the preparedness capacity. Haimes et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>] argue that a balance must be sought between protection actions and resilience as means to improve the overall efficiency of preparedness.",
            "An enterprise\u2019s ability to be prepared to face disruptive events is related to its vulnerability to such events. The more vulnerable a company is, the less prepared it is. For this reason, it is important for enterprises to get ahead of themselves to minimize the negative effects of disruptions.",
            "The ability to respond and recover from a disruptive situation is key for bolstering ER. In today\u2019s highly dynamic environments, a company is never a static entity. Some sectors are more stable than others, but a company that remains static in the same position over time will lose its potential to achieve its goals. Businesses must also change in response to changing environments in order to preserve their competitive advantage [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>]. These authors also argue that after a disruptive event occurs, a company should not aim to recover and overcome that disorder by returning to its initial state but must recover and reach the level (maybe the same as the initial one, or a lower or higher one) at which its competitive advantages are maintained. The dynamism of the environment may mean that, during the recovery period, the changes that occurred in the environment mean that the state the enterprise must reach after its recovery differs from the initial state at which the company operated before being impacted by such a disruptive event. Therefore, the steady state that it reaches must be aligned with the conditions of its current external environment [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>].",

Dovers and Handmer [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>] also highlight the importance of the adaptive capacity by describing that proactive resilience accepts the inevitability of change and attempts to create a system that is capable of adapting to new conditions and imperatives. Thus, the company must be prepared for disruptive events, and the more adaptable it is, the easier for it to anticipate such events.",

McManus et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] considers adaptive capacity to be a measure of business culture and dynamics to appropriately make decisions in the time required in both daily activities and in the face of crises and disruptive events. Ricciardi et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>] also support this and highlight that a firm\u2019s performance in turbulent business environments strongly depends on the adaptive (re)generation of their business models.",

Following the works of [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>], the dynamicity of the adaptive capacity also allows companies to be prepared before disruptive events occur by them implementing anticipation actions flexibly and agilely.

            "In a nutshell, when a disruptive event occurs, a company is pushed from a state of relative equilibrium to another state characterized by instability. The ease with which the company moves to this new unstable state is a measure of its vulnerability [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>], understood as a lack of the preparedness capacity to deal with the disruptive event, while the degree with which the company responds to this change is a measure of its recovery capacity."

Tomlin [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>] describes two general approaches to deal with disruptive events: mitigation and contingency policies. Sanchis and Poler [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>] also argue that actions must encompass two perspectives: on the one hand, proactive actions to be prepared to face adverse situations; on the other hand, reactive actions that are applied to facilitate the recovery process. Both must be planned before the disruptive event occurs, although mitigation policies are implemented prior to the event occurring, while contingency policies are generally implemented after an event has taken place. In this research work, mitigation policies are preventive actions to enhance the preparedness capacity, while contingency ones are the knowledge registration actions that improve the recovery capacity.",
            "The company implements preventive actions before disruptive event occurs and, therefore, they are essentially proactive in nature [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. A proactive policy emphasizes preventive plans for defining what may be done to avoid specific disruptive events or for preventing them from occurring as much as possible. For those inevitable disruptive events, effort should focus on mitigating their negative consequences.",
            "Preventive actions are policies and/or actions that attempt to reduce the probability of the occurrence and/or severity of a disruptive event. Barroso et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>] state that preventive actions should be address: (i) reducing the probability of disturbance occurring; (ii) reducing the negative impact of disturbance; (iii) both.",
            "Chopra et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>] point out the following preventive actions as being effective for improving ER: increased capacity, safety stock, redundancy in the supplier base, increased flexibility, aggregate demand, increased and improved business skills, and diversification regarding customers, so that dependence on a single key customer is not strong. All these preventive actions are perfect for facing a specific disruptive event and can be of much help to companies globally. However, not all preventive actions are adequate for all disruptive events, and they must be adapted according to the specificity and the characteristics of potential disruptive events.",
            "The conceptual reference framework to assess ER offers a collection of preventive actions that have been customized to each type of disruptive event. The proposal of preventive actions, which was developed based on an exhaustive literature review, was verified by a panel of experienced experts in each origin of disruption sources during two consecutive rounds in a Delphi study, as described in Section 3 (more information in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>]). Initially, the proposal included 310 preventive actions, of which 3% were eliminated after the first round, and 103 preventive actions were included upon the experts\u2019 request. During the second analysis round, the experts evaluated the new situation after eliminating the preventive actions and including the new ones by drawing up the list of the definitive preventive actions making up the predefined list of preventive actions for each disruptive event. Currently, the conceptual reference framework contains 403 preventive actions, but it is noteworthy that the same preventive action can apply to different disruptive events, which left 312 different preventive actions.",
            "ER is in accordance with the ability to anticipate and be prepared for disruptive events (by implementing preventive actions) but also with the ability to recover once a disruptive event has occurred. To improve ER, the company\u2019s ability to recover as quickly and efficiently as possible is performed by managing its knowledge. Ponomarov et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>] argue that one of the most difficult aspects of the recovery phase is the restoration of social routines and economic activities. These authors explain that part of the recovery process consists of restoring people\u2019s psychological stability after the disruptive event, and it also involves learning positive lessons from the experience to be applied in the future if the same event or another one with similar effects happens.",
            "Wildavsky [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>] argues that resilient organizations are vitally prepared for adversity, which requires improving the company\u2019s recovery capacity to research, learn, and act without knowing in advance what will happen. Vogus and Sutcliffe [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>] point out that recovery is based on both past and future learning. Following the same line of thought, the recovery capacity is based on the human capacity to learn and act in a timely manner with valid information [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c96\" href=\"#r96\">96</a>].",
            "Sutcliffe and Vogus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] argue that ER is obtained through processes that create cognitive, emotional, relational, or structural resources in a sufficiently flexible, storable, convertible, and malleable form that enables companies to successfully cope and learn from the unexpected. In this way, the most resilient companies are those with a structure that facilitates learning and reusing knowledge from an organized knowledge storage basis.",
            "Dalziell et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] also explain that one of the ways in which a system can recover from adverse situations is applying available responses to deal with disruptive events. To do so, profound knowledge of the available responses to disruptive events that have already occurred is required to reuse the knowledge generated in past recovery actions.",
            "In light of this, information availability is basic and, for this purpose, registering information about (i) the disruptive events that took place and (ii) the measures taken to recover in the shortest possible time and with at the lowest cost is vitally important to improve the recovery capacity, one of the two vital cornerstones of ER. In 1996, Del Olmo and S\u00e1iz [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>] already pointed out the need for companies to increase the resources addressed to knowledge acquisition. However, it is not only important to record historic information, but a company\u2019s commitment to record knowledge about future events as and when they occur is also vital. Long-term continuity in knowledge registration of all the disruptive events that have affected the company at some point in its life cycle is required to ensure that knowledge is available whenever required.",
            "The conceptual reference framework is based on the fact that knowledge management will improve companies\u2019 resilience because it will: (i) be reused whenever necessary (e.g., when the same disruptive event occurs or a similar one with related effects); (ii) be shared with all stakeholders so that they all are aware of the consequences of disruptive events and which steps are to be taken to recover efficiently; (iii) be systematically and continuously improved with new experiences; (iv) be used for continuous learning. Therefore, one of the most important factors for improving the recovery capacity after disruption is having an appropriate knowledge management system.

This small section (Table 6) of the ER Conceptual Reference Framework involves 11 disruptive events and one per disruption origins. However, it is worth mentioning that the framework involves seven events from the supply origin, nine disruptive events related to customers, six from distribution issues and six related to technological problems, two related to energy aspects, 11 regarding environmental issues, four financial disruptive events, seven related to inventory features and seven social aspects, three events about legislation problems, and nine of production aspects. This totals 71 disruptive events.",
            "By way of example, one of the disruptive events shown in Table 6 is \u201cPoor quality of the raw materials or components supplied\u201d. This event takes place at the inter-enterprise level because it involves the enterprise\u2019s suppliers. For this reason, the origin of the disruptive event is \u201csupply \u201c, and the suborigin is \u201cquality\u201d, as the disruptive event is also related to problems about the quality conditions of the supplied materials. If this disruptive event occurs, the potential impact on the enterprise involves the following consequences: (i) business interruption; (iii) delays to and failed due dates; (v) failure to meet customer needs; (x) injury to end customers; (xvii) unfulfilled orders. Once the enterprise has characterized the disruptive event based on the information provided in the conceptual reference framework, the company will be able to analyze which preventive actions it could implement to be prepared to face such disruptive events. Following the previous example, in this case, the conceptual reference framework offers seven alternatives to improve the preparedness capacity. For instance, if the enterprise has a safety stock, it will be able to continue operating at its normal operation level, while the supplier manages the situation to supply raw materials in perfect state. In this case, implementing such a preventive action will avoid the enterprise having to interrupt its production line while it awaits raw materials of the required quality. Finally, if this event occurs and the enterprise has not implemented any preventive action or those implemented fail, recovery will be easier and more efficient if the enterprise has recorded past information about the same disruptive event and how the situation was solved on that occasion. For this reason, the conceptual reference framework offers recommendations about the information to be registered for future events."

            "This paper proposes the Enterprise resilience Conceptual Reference Framework to characterize ER capacity. To do so, this paper reviews different ER definitions in Section 2 to identify its main characteristics and the importance of being resilient. In this way, Research Question 1 is answered. Moreover, this review evidences that only a few ER assessment attempts have been developed. The main objective of the proposed conceptual framework is for it to be a reference basis to develop mechanisms that assess the ER capacity of companies and, thus, to take support companies\u2019 decision makers about which actions have to be implemented to enhance the ER capacity.",
            "The first conceptual framework element is to identify the most frequent events with a negative impact on the ER capacity. To do so, a literature review validated by a panel of experts was performed so that Research Question 2 was answered. The current framework version contains 71 disruptive events that have been classified as the most worrisome in recent years by companies.",
            "Moreover, by analyzing ER definitions, the main enterprise capabilities for companies to be resilient were identified. This identification responded to Research Question 3 by pointing out that, among others, preparedness and recovery capabilities are the two most quoted one in the analysis of ER definitions. From the small sample of ER definitions (11 definitions) in Table 2, 54% of them highlight disposition and preparation as the ways to be more resilient [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], and 72% of the ER definition points out either recovery or adjustment [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. With a sample of 56 ER definitions, the results follow the same tendency. In light of this, the ER Conceptual Reference Framework is based on the proactive and the reactive perspective by considering the preparedness capacity and the recovery capacity, respectively, to be constituent capacities of ER.",
            "In addition, the conceptual reference framework also proposes actions to support companies to enhance the ER process that has been designated as transition elements. It is assumed that the preparedness capability can be enhanced as preventive actions are activated and implemented. This is supported by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>], who second that preventive actions are effective mechanisms for improving ER, and by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>], who state that the preventive actions are directed to: (i) reduce the probability of the disruptive event occurring; (ii) reduce the negative impact of the disturbance; (iii) both, which will enhance the preparedness capacity. Moreover, it is theorized that the recovery capability can be enhanced by implementing knowledge registration actions. This is supported by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>], who state that the recovery capability can be improved by implementing past actions, which means that it is very important to register the knowledge of such past actions to learn positive lessons from those experiences, which facilitates the restoring process.",
            "Moreover, the Delphi study performed by a panel of experts from different knowledge domains (academics, industry professionals, consultants, researchers, etc.) was used to validate all the transition elements included in the ER Conceptual Reference Framework. The current framework version contains 403 preventive actions and the design for knowledge registration actions, which supports the response to Research Question 4.",
            "The ER Conceptual Reference Framework has much potential to provide management insight into disruptive events that need prior attention given their critical nature and periodicity. This framework will support managers to identify highly rated critical disruptive events that can severely degrade ER. This approach must be based on assessing the frequency and the severity of an enterprise\u2019s disruptive events.",
            "Besides, the framework also contributes by facilitating the decision-making process by proposing sets of anticipatory actions to acquire further information about what they can do to be prepared for the unexpected.",
            "Finally, the framework provides managerial guidance for designing the knowledge resilience structure to create a learning and knowledge strategy to improve ER.",
            "The ER Conceptual Reference Framework needs to be followed by empirical validation. To date, the feedback received by the Delphi study\u2019s experts was very positive and conferred the proposed framework much potential.",
            "Further research will focus on developing quantitative methods and tools to assess to what extent enterprises are resilient based on this framework. The literature review evidenced a lack of measurement and assessment tools to support the ER capacity analysis. For this reason, the present research work will continue by addressing measurement and implementation issues. Indeed, the conceptual reference framework will be the basis for developing a mechanism to measure and enhance the ER capacity. To do so, further research lines will focus on measuring the ER capacity from both proactive and reactive perspectives. The current preparedness and the recovery capacity status (AS IS ER model) of companies should be quantitatively assessed and, based on this characterization, the TO BE ER model will be defined. From the preparedness viewpoint, this definition should involve selecting the optimal preventive actions based on some criteria, such as costs, operating usefulness of the implemented actions, and implementation time, to mention just a few. This will require using optimization and simulation algorithms. Well-adapted ones can be the algorithms addressed to solve mixed-integer linear programming. Other potential approaches may involve mathematical programming in deterministic and fuzzy contexts, genetic algorithms, fuzzy cognitive maps, system dynamics, discrete events simulation, and agent-based simulation. From the recovery point of view, the TO BE ER model definition can benefit from the knowledge management system structure design of the proposed framework.",
            "At this point, it is worth mentioning that resilience is not a static goal but future research lines proposed to measure resilience as an evaluation of current and future states in terms of preparedness and recovery capabilities. For this reason, it is important to highlight that the conceptual reference framework is an openly dynamic approach that can be updated whenever necessary by including more disruptive events that we presently do not even think could happen.",
            "Future further research areas will also involve analyzing the resilient capacity of organizations whose main activity does not purely focus on manufacturing products but those entities that offer services, such as healthcare and tourism sectors.",
