Patients who were transferred to the ICU had a deeper nadir ALC, nadir AMC and nadir hemoglobin, and higher peak ANC and peak LDH levels as compared to patients who did not require ICU stay."

        "limitations": [
            "The limitation of our study is missing data as laboratory investigations were not performed daily on all patients especially those who were minimally symptomatic in the general isolation ward. We also recognize that correlating onset of symptoms (days of illness) with hematological parameters is important and would require a case note review which was not done in this study. However, this review is a reflection of real-life clinical setting wherein a proportion of asymptomatic patients (admitted from positive RT-PCR results during contact tracing) may not have significant anomalies on their CBC at presentation. Lastly, admission laboratory results for ICU patients transferred from other institutions were not reflected in our data set. This may result in lower hematological indices on admission as those patients were already in critical condition. Further studies should be conducted comparing patients\u2019 onset of symptoms and correlating their clinical condition to laboratory findings."

            "A cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases was reported by the People\u2019s Republic of China to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019. The aetiology for this outbreak was a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which was responsible for the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Singapore confirmed its first imported case on January 23, 2020 and local transmission was detected on February 4, 2020. As of February 28, 2020, Singapore had 96 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by real time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), performed on respiratory samples of these patients. A majority of 69 out of these 96 patients were treated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). We herein present a detailed analysis of the hematological parameters of the COVID-19 patients at the NCID (see table 1).",
            "Of the 69 patients that had been admitted to the NCID, 26 patients were still hospitalized, and 43 patients had been discharged as of February 28, 2020. 67 patients had at least one complete blood count (CBC) performed during inpatient stay; 65 patients had CBC performed on day of admission. We analysed the hematological indices of all COVID-19 infected patients from day 1 of admission until February 28, 2020. We obtained data from the Laboratory Information System (LIS) exclusively which provided information on the age, gender, ethnicity and location of each patient. We divided the patients into two groups; ICU and non-ICU patients. Additionally, flow cytometry on lymphocyte subsets was performed from February 24-28, 2020, on a subgroup of 9 COVID-19 patients; 5 ICU patients and 4 non-ICU patients (with 6 normal individual blood samples as controls). Immunophenotyping was performed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCantoTMII Flow analyser."

This contrasts with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 where reactive lymphocytes were not observed in a study on Haematologic parameters in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Singapore[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and only in 15.2% of cases in a similar Hong Kong study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]",
