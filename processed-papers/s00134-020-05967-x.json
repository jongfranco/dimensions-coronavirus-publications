            "Etiological agent and epidemiology The new agent causing this pneumonia, a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was identified and sequenced [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] and diagnostic tests were developed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization issued a worldwide public health alert on the emergence of a new epidemic viral disease. On February 3, 2020, 17,391 confirmed cases (153 cases outside of China) have been reported (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). The overall mortality rate of affected patients is difficult to assess at this time, because of the lack of a reliable denominator. Severe forms represent 14% of the reported cases, and the overall mortality is around 2% of the confirmed cases. To date, 153 cases have been reported in 23 countries outside China (overall, 24 cases in Europe), most of them being imported cases: tourists coming from China, or China-originating persons returning to their country of residence after traveling to visit family in Wuhan or other Chinese",
            "Clinical features To date, the ECDC criteria to require diagnostic testing for suspected cases are patients with acute respiratory infection (requiring hospitalization or not) in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms with at least one of the following epidemiological criteria being present: close contact with a confirmed or probable case of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COrona VIrus Disease 2019, COVID-19) (or) history of travel to China (or) having worked in or having attended a health care facility where patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections were being treated (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/case-definition-andeuropean-surveillance-human-infection-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov)."
