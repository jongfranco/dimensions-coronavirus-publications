        "abstract": "There is rising global concern for the recently emerged novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov). Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks in order to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and SARS. We confirm high sequence similarity (&gt;99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hyper-variable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.",

At the time of writing, 14,441 cases of 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia cases have been reported in China, plus 118 cases from 23 other countries. There are currently 315 deaths linked to this pathogen (source: World Health Organization report, 02-Feb-2020). Phylogenetic relationships between Bat and Human coronaviridae have been discovered for SARS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] and more recently also for 2019-nCoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], suggesting events of inter-species transmissions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].",

Apart from the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends, likely non-protein coding and less homogeneous, we identified two hotspots of hypervariability at positions 8789 and 28151 (Figure 3 B and C).",
            "Position 8789 witnesses the presence of either T (U) or C, and it falls within the polyprotein gene. It causes a synonymous variation in the nucleotide triplet encoding for Serine 2839 (aminoacid coordinates based on the reference genome NC_045512.2), so it is likely not to introduce phenotypical differences between the different strains.",

Unfortunately, no crystal structures of close homologs to the ORF8 protein are available for a reliable homology modelling to measure the structural impact of this aminoacid substitution. The closest 3D model to 2019-nCoV ORF8 available in Protein Data Bank [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] is a short 22 aminoacid stretch in the protein entry 6P65, with a non-significant E-value of 0.848. We therefore employed de novo methods to infer structural features of ORF8. One important effect we could detect is a significant effect of Serine in ORF8-S in inducing structural disorder in the protein C-terminal portion, which is not predicted to be present in the ORF8-L (Figure 4 B), using the Russell/Linding algorithm [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
