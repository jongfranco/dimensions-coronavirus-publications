Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\nMethods In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.",

            "In summary, an outbreak of novel coronavirus is ongoing at Wuhan in the winter of 2019\u201320. Similar to the 2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, Wuhan is also a rapidly flourishing capital city of the Hubei province and the traffic hub of central China. Moreover, both outbreaks were initially connected to wet markets where game animals and meat were sold. In the case of SARS, personto-person transmission was efficient and super-spreading events had led to major outbreaks in hotels and hospitals."

            "We report here a familial cluster of unexplained pneumonia due to 2019-nCoV. Six of seven family members had radiological changes of viral pneumonia, among whom five (patients 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7) tested positive for<br/><br/>2019-nCoV by RT-PCR. Five patients (patients 1, 2, 3, 4, www.thelancet.com Vol 395 February 15, 2020<br/><br/>and 7) had associated symptoms at the time of presentation. Complete genome sequences of the two strains from patients 2 and 5 showed almost complete nucleotide identity with each other, and were closest to the bat SARS-related coronaviruses reported in 2018. Several possible scenarios of transmission exist. The first and most likely scenario is that one virologically documented patient with pneumonia (patient 1) acquired the infection from a Wuhan hospital while visiting their relative (relative 1) and then patients 1\u20135 transmitted the virus to patient 7 on returning to Shenzhen. The second scenario is that patients 1\u20135 have directly acquired the infection from relatives 2\u20135 and transmitted it to patient 7 on returning to Shenzhen. But this scenario is less likely because patients 1\u20135 developed symptoms before relatives 2\u20135.

The second scenario is that patients 1\u20135 have directly acquired the infection from relatives 2\u20135 and transmitted it to patient 7 on returning to Shenzhen.
