        "abstract": "2019-nCoV, which is a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, has caused at least infected 11,844 as of Feb 1, 2020. However, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine currently. Very recently report had suggested that novel CoV would use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as the SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a novel recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of 2019-nCoV.",

Fusion proteins were further purified using protein A Sepharose with the harvested cell culture supernatant.

However, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine currently. Very recently report had suggested that novel CoV would use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as the SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a novel recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of 2019-nCoV.",

            "Based on the receptor function of ACE2 for coronavirus, we hypothesis that ACE2 fusion protein may have neutralization potential for coronavirus, especially the 2019-nCoV. To further evaluated the therapeutic potential of ACE2, fusion protein (ACE2-Ig) consisting of the extracellular domain of human ACE2 linked to the Fc domain of human IgG1 was constructed and generated (Fig. 1). An ACE2 variant (HH/NN) in which two active-site histidines (residues 374 and 378) have been altered to asparagines was also used in our study to reduce the catalytic activity. The fusion protein contain the ACE2 variant were termed as mACE2-Ig. The expression and purification methods were described in our previous reports[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The affinities of the fusion proteins for SARS-CoV RBD and 2019-nCoV RBD were determined with BIAcore binding",
            "assays (Fig. S1) and both fusion proteins showed high affinity to RBDs. Moreover, the fusion proteins had similar denaturation temperature compared with the Fc fusion protein TIGIT-Ig reported in our pervious report[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], suggesting a IgG-like stability. The lowest concentration (< 2%) of high molecular weight and low molecular weight products was observed after 1 week of storage at 40 \u00b0C at a 1 mg/ml concentration. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of the fusion proteins were then tested in our study. Mice were treated separately with a single intravenous dose of fusion proteins and the serum concentrations of fusion proteins were determined by ELISA. The results showed that the main PK parameters of ACE2-Ig, mACE2-Ig and TIGIT-Ig were very similar in mice and demonstrated the high stability of the fusion proteins. The experimental data are summarized in Table S1.",
            "After we identified that ACE2 fusion proteins binds to the RBDs with high affinity, we next sought to test the inhibitory activity of ACE2 fusion proteins against 2019-nCoV and compare it with that against SARS-CoV, by using viruses pseudotyped with the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Our data shows that Both SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV viruses were potently neutralized by ACE2-Ig and mACE2-Ig. The IC50 of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV viruses neutralized by ACE2-Ig were 0.8 and 0.1 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. And The IC50 of the two viruses neutralized by mACE2-Ig were 0.9 and 0.08 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (Fig. 2). No evidence of neutralization was observed for the TIGIT-Ig. We next using cell fusion assay to further characterize the in vitro neutralization effect of the fusion proteins (Fig .3). ACE2-Ig potently inhibited the SARS CoV-S protein-mediated fusion with an IC50 of 0.85 \u03bcg/ml, and the 2019 nCoV-S protein-mediated fusion with an IC50 of 0.65 \u03bcg/ml. Under the same experimental conditions, another fusion protein mACE2-Ig exhibited an IC50 of 0.76 \u03bcg/ml and 0.48\u03bcg/ml, for the SARS CoV and 2019 nCoV, respectively. The control TIGIT-Fc did not show any inhibitory effect in this assay. These data suggest that both ACE2-Ig and mACE2-Ig exhibit potent inhibitory activity against SARS CoV and 2019 nCOV.",
            "ACE2 has already been identified as an important drug targets for the treatment of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Although it has been established that ACE2 is a key function receptor for the coronavirus infection, the practical use of rACE2 protein may be impede by the short half-life of rACE2. Recombinant Fc fusion technique, which enable",
            "soluble proteins to extend plasma residence time, improve in vivo efficacy, and gain immunoreactive functions, has been widely used in modern biopharmaceuticals. For example, new long-acting forms of both recombinant coagulation factors rFVIII-Fc and rFIX-Fc were recently approved for clinical treatments of hemophilia A and B that require less frequent infusions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. And the TNF receptor fusion protein has been use in clinic for decades[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Unlike the blood resident enzymes of coagulation factors, full-length endogenous ACE2 is a transmembrane protein anchored to the cell surface and that ACE2 activities are, in fact, present at very low levels in systemic circulation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Therefore, one safety concern of the ACE2 fusion protein is that they may have systemic cardiovascular side-effect. Interestingly, one recently report shows that treatment of murine ACE2 fusion proteins in mice show no evidence of side-effect[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Moreover, our preliminary studies showed that the neutralization effect remained efficient when two active-site histidines of ACE2 were modified to asparagine.",
            "To sum up, our data investigate the therapeutic potential of ACE2 based strategies against 2019-nCoV which could be used alone or in combination. Based on the molecular mechanisms of blocking of ACE2, the fusion proteins have the potential to have broad neutralizing activity to coronavirus. These ACE2 fusion proteins could be also used for diagnosis and as research reagents in the development of vaccines and inhibitors."
