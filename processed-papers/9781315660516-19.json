She suggests that the nature of citizen participation has dramatically evolved as citizens become further empowered in raising their voices and influencing over public policy-making processes. Citizen involvement has been far more inclusive and active in cases of policy or political failures in South Korea. Kim discusses the development of citizen-government interactions, participatory mechanisms, and challenging issues in citizen-led participatory governance in South Korea. Participatory governance is a safeguard for ensuring government responsibility and accountability in decision-making, but the South Korean government and citizens should continue to improve their constructive and complementary roles by redefining their respective roles to promote an effective collaborative relationship.",
