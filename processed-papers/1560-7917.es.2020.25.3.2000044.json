            "A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged recently in Wuhan, China. Information on reported cases strongly indicates human-to-human spread, and the most recent information is increasingly indicative of sustained human-tohuman transmission. While the overall severity profile among cases may change as more mild cases are identified, we estimate a risk of fatality among hospitalised cases at 14% (95% confidence interval: 3.9\u201332%).",

A much larger number of coronaviruses have been detected in animals, particularly in bats, but have not been found in humans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Prior to December 2019 when clusters of pneumonia cases with unknown aetiology were detected in Wuhan, China, only two additional strains of coronaviruses had caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory disease around the world [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. In the 2003 outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections in mainland China, Hong Kong and a number of other locations, there were more than 8,000 documented cases and 774 deaths [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Since 2012, outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have occurred in the Middle East [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], and in 2015, there was a large outbreak in South Korea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].

A separate priority is to identify the animal reservoir of this novel pathogen and any intermediary hosts, including potential supply chains of wild or game meat.",
            "It is challenging to judge severity from the information available to date. We estimated the risk of death among hospitalised cases of around 14% (Figure 2). For both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, the risk of severe disease increases substantially with age and with the presence of underlying conditions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. One other caveat with estimating severity is that there can be long delays between hospitalisation and death for infections that are ultimately fatal. For SARS in Hong Kong, the average time from illness to death for fatal cases was 24 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. This means that early estimates of the case fatality risk that ignore the potential outcomes of cases still in hospital are typically underestimates of the final severity profile [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. We accounted for that by only including cases that either died or recovered in our estimate of the hospital fatality risk. Given that the cases reported outside Wuhan have mostly not been severe, it would be reasonable to infer that there might be a large number of undetected relatively mild infections in Wuhan and that the infection fatality risk is below 1% or even below 0.1%.",
            "There are a number of limitations to our analyses. Most importantly, they are only based on data in the public domain to date. Detailed information has not yet been released by authoritative sources on the most recently reported cases. In our analysis in the Table, support for scenario 2 might increase if contact tracing or medical surveillance was incomplete, if there was incomplete ascertainment of clusters or if there was an early focus in testing cases linked to the Southern China Seafood Wholesale Market that led to a selection bias in the prevalence of market exposures among the early cases."
