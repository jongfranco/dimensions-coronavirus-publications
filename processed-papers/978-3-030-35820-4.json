Histopathologic images and corresponding clinical photographs facilitate clinical pathologic correlation of the conditions discussed in each chapter. Bulleted summaries for quick easy-to-read reference and diagnostic pearls are provided for each of the discussed entities. Each chapter ends with several case studies in which clinical presentation, histologic interpretation and work-up of these challenging scenarios are outlined. This book represents an international collaboration and a wealth of clinical expertise and years of experience of authors from Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America."
