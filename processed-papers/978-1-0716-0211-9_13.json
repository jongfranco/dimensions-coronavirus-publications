        "abstract": "First identified in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel virus that can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death, with a case fatality rate of ~35%. An animal model that supports MERS-CoV infection and causes severe lung disease is useful to study pathogenesis and evaluate therapies and vaccines. The murine dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Dpp4) protein is not a functional receptor for MERS-CoV; thus, mice are resistant to MERS-CoV infection. We generated human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4 KI) mice by replacing exons 10\u201312 at the mouse Dpp4 locus with exons 10\u201312 from the human DPP4 gene. The resultant human DPP4 KI mice are permissive to MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012 strain) infection but develop no disease. To generate a mouse model with associated morbidity and mortality from respiratory disease, we serially passaged HCoV-EMC/2012 strain in the lungs of young hDPP4 KI mice. After 30 in vivo passages, an adapted virus clone was isolated and designated MERSMA6.1.2. This virus clone produced significantly higher titers than the parental clone in the lungs of hDPP4 KI mice and caused diffuse lung injury and a fatal respiratory infection. In this chapter, we will describe in detail the procedures used to mouse adapt MERS-CoV by serial passage of the virus in lungs. We also describe the methods used to isolate virus clones and characterize virus infection.",

            "First identified in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel virus that can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death, with a case fatality rate of ~35%. An animal model that supports MERS-CoV infection and causes severe lung disease is useful to study pathogenesis and evaluate therapies and vaccines. The murine dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Dpp4) protein is not a functional receptor for MERS-CoV; thus, mice are resistant to MERS-CoV infection. We generated human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4 KI) mice by replacing exons 10\u201312 at the mouse Dpp4 locus with exons 10\u201312 from the human DPP4 gene. The resultant human DPP4 KI mice are permissive to MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012 strain) infection but develop no disease. To generate a mouse model with associated morbidity and mortality from respiratory disease, we serially passaged HCoV-EMC/2012 strain in the lungs of young hDPP4 KI mice. After 30 in vivo passages, an adapted virus clone was isolated and designated MERSMA6.1.2. This virus clone produced significantly higher titers than the parental clone in the lungs of hDPP4 KI mice and caused diffuse lung injury and a fatal respiratory infection. In this chapter, we will describe in detail the procedures used to mouse adapt MERS-CoV by serial passage of the virus in lungs. We also describe the methods used to isolate virus clones and characterize virus infection.",

            "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a fatal respiratory illness that first appeared on the Saudi Arabian Peninsula in mid-2012. It is caused by a novel betacoronavirus, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Shortly after the identification of the virus, its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) was discovered [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. As of September 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 2468 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS in 27 countries, including 851 associated deaths (fatality rate: ~35%). MERS-CoV does not currently have pandemic potential [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. However, MERS-CoV is still epidemic in the Middle East and remains a cause for significant concern due to the potential spread by global travel as demonstrated by the outbreak in South Korea in 2015 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "162 Kun Li and Paul B. McCray Jr.",
            "To date, there are only two published reports on autopsy findings from subjects who died from MERS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] and our understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis in humans is still limited. Animal models are useful for the study of viral diseases and play an important role in the investigation of pathogenesis and evaluation of antiviral therapies and vaccines. An ideal animal model should be permissive to the viral infection and develop disease and pathology with similarities to that observed in humans. MERS-CoV infection has been evaluated in two nonhuman primate (NHP) models, the rhesus macaque and common marmoset [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Both species are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. However, MERS-CoV caused only a transient lower respiratory tract infection without mortality in rhesus macaques [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In common marmosets, the consequences of MERS-CoV infection are controversial. Falzarano et al reported the common marmoset reproduced several features of MERS-CoV infection in humans including progressive severe pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], while another group observed only mild to moderate nonlethal respiratory disease following MERS-CoV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Thus, the common marmoset is potentially a model to study pathogenesis and evaluate antiviral therapies and vaccines. However, NHPs are expensive, their availability limited, and their use may raise ethical concerns. In contrast, small animal models provide advantages over NHPs, including reduced cost, availability in large numbers, ease of handling, and species-specific reagents, especially for the studies of highly pathogenic viruses like MERS-CoV in the Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory. Unfortunately, common small laboratory animals like mice [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], ferrets [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], guinea pigs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], and hamsters [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection because their homologous DPP4 cannot be bound and utilized by MERS-CoV as a host receptor for entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Haagmans et al detected MERS-CoV RNA in the respiratory tract of New Zealand white rabbits following inoculation but found no clinical signs of disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>].",
            "Several strategies have been used to overcome this receptor incompatibility and develop mouse models of MERS-CoV infection. In 2014, we developed the first mouse model of MERS-CoV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. We delivered a recombinant adenovirus 5 encoding human DPP4 (hDPP4) to the lungs of mice. Transient expression of hDPP4 by adenovirus transduction made the mice temporarily permissive for MERS-CoV infection, but animals developed only mild lung disease. Generation of transgenic mice expressing a virus receptor is a common strategy to make mice permissive to infection. Several groups in addition to ours developed mice with transgenic expression of hDPP4 using different promoters [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. The disease severity following MERS-CoV infection in transgenic mice correlated with the cellular distribution and expression level of hDPP4. In transgenic mice expressing hDPP4 driven by the cytokeratin 18 promoter [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] or a ubiquitous promoter [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>],"
        ],
        "2 Materials": [
            "MERS-CoV replicates and causes respiratory disease and mortality. However, the lethality was found to be secondary to overwhelming central nervous system (CNS) disease or multiorgan damage. This was also observed in mice transgenic for human ACE2 driven by the cytokeratin 18 promoter and infected with SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. In transgenic mice expressing hDPP4 under the human surfactant protein C (SPC) promoter, which restricts expression to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelia, MERS-CoV infection caused only mild disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Thus, these transgenic mice do not reproduce a severe lung disease phenotype that resembles MERS.",
            "Alternative strategies for the creation of mouse models of MERS-CoV infection are generation of DPP4 humanized mice and adaptation of the virus to the animals. Pascal et al reported a model in which all of the mouse Dpp4 exons had been humanized and also generated humanized monoclonal antibodies against the MERS-CoV S protein using a novel strategy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. MERS-CoV infection in this model caused pulmonary edema, vascular cuffing, and alveolar septal thickening with an associated ~20% weight loss, necessitating euthanasia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Another MERS mouse model was engineered by changing two amino acids in the mouse Dpp4 locus using CRISPR-Cas9 technology [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. This model supported MERS-CoV replication without severe disease. Similarly, our human DPP4 knock-in mouse model supported MERS-CoV replication but did not lead to a severe lung disease phenotype [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Two mouse-adapted (MA) strains of MERS-CoV were subsequently developed independently by serial passage of the HCoVEMC/2012 strain [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] in the lungs of the two humanized mouse models [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. The resultant MERS-15 and MERSMA6.1.2 mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strains replicated to high titers in the lungs of the CRISPR-Cas9 genetically engineered mouse model and the hDPP4 knock-in mouse model, respectively. The respiratory disease that developed in both mouse models and the associated mortality shared similarities with severe cases of MERS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Mouse adaptation was also successfully used to generate several SARS-CoV strains capable of modeling severe SARS-CoV lung disease in mice [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. Thus, the adaption of the virus to enhance virulence in the mouse is a very useful approach to generate mouse models for coronavirus-associated lung disease.",
