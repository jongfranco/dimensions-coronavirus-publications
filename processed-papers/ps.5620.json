As the surfactant concentration increased, the wetting abilities of the solutions improved due a decrease in liquid surface tension. The decrease in contact angles followed an inverted \u2018S\u2019 shape until the concentration exceeded the critical micelle concentration, at which point surfactant adsorption was saturated at the interfaces. The nonionic surfactant TX\u2010100 enhanced wettability more than the ionic surfactants SDS and DTAB. The wetting states of the three surfactant solutions on housefly surfaces transformed to the Wenzel state when the surfactant molecules adsorbed at solid\u2013liquid interfaces (\u0393SL) were 3.09\u20135.36 times higher than those adsorbed at liquid\u2013air interfaces (\u0393LV). More insecticides attached to housefly surfaces and pesticide utilization was significantly improved after adding TX\u2010100 to the pesticide solution."
