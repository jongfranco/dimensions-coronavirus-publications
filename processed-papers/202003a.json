            "It is believed that the virus responsible for COVID-19 originated from an animal found in an open-air food market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Many possibilities have been discussed since the virus emerged, but the original reservoir species (initially thought to be a species of bat) has not been confirmed. Whether directly or through an intermediary animal, the virus \u201cjumped\u201d from this initial reservoir species to humans. After this initial transmission, the outbreak appears to be sustained through relatively efficient human-to-human transmission. Fortunately, from available data, the fatality rate appears relatively low compared with SARS and MERS.",
            "Wuhan is central China\u2019s transportation hub, and soon after the outbreak began, some 5 million travelers left the region for other locations in mainland China and global destinations\u2014many traveling in anticipation of the Lunar New Year. As the outbreak progressed, the Chinese government took the unprecedented step of quarantining the 50 million inhabitants of Wuhan and the wider Hubei province. Further complicating the global response to the pandemic, a suddenly symptomatic Chinese passenger caused a Mediterranean cruise ship, Costa Smeralda, with 6,000 passengers on board to be placed under quarantine in Italian waters. A second cruise ship, Diamond Princess, was also quarantined off Yokohama, Japan, after a passenger became symptomatic. Almost all airline flights to and from China have been grounded (as of the publication of this Commentary), and this extreme disruption of both traffic and commerce to and from the world\u2019s second-largest economy has had a growing and potential seismic effect on global production, supply chains, and financial markets."
