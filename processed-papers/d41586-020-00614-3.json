            "As leaders of the national ethics committees of France and Germany, and of the UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics, we consider that the moral and societal issues raised by developments in heritable human-genome editing demand a level of public ethical reflection that current initiatives fail to meet.",
            "In a joint statement, we call on governments and stakeholders worldwide to ensure that heritable genome editing is brought within the control of relevant public authorities (see go.nature.com/3ck1mc). Furthermore, no clinical applications should be considered until there has been broad societal debate about their acceptability and until research has reduced the considerable risks of clinical use to an acceptable level. Measures must be in place to ensure that these risks can be properly assessed and monitored.",
            "Moreover, any ethically permissible application of human genome editing should not increase disadvantage, discrimination or division in society. The large range of conceivable applications, as well as their implications for families, society and future generations, calls for cautious, responsible and transparent governance (see also go.nature.com/3c9fe1).",

            "As president of Peru\u2019s National Council of Science, Technology and Technological Innovation (CONCYTEC), I disagree that the government is not showing sufficient interest in the country\u2019s research (see Nature 576, S65\u2013S67; 2019).",
            "The government\u2019s expenditure on research and development has increased over the past decade, and this year sees its highest budget ever, at 214 million soles (US$63 million; see go.nature.com/2ufux1k, in Spanish). And some public universities are investing their royalties from natural resources such as mining into research infrastructure and projects.",
            "A 2018 report by Elsevier commissioned by CONCYTEC indicates that Peru\u2019s fieldweighted citation impact in 2013\u201317 was above the world\u2019s average. And, according to SCImago rankings, Peru\u2019s research is becoming less dependent on international collaborations, with more than 40% of its publications in 2018 exclusively authored by Peruvian scientists.",
            "Last May, the government passed a law to attract and retain more highly qualified scientists. CONCYTEC, with the support of a World Bank project, incorporated 181 local and foreign researchers into Peruvian institutions in 2019.",
            "Notwithstanding these efforts, we recognize that we still have a long way to go in improving Peru\u2019s research.",
            "The great replicability mystery of \u2018social priming\u2019 in psychology (Nature 576, 200\u2013202; 2019) turns out to reflect a mundane fact: priming studies (social or non-social) that use reliable methods are highly replicable, whereas those that don\u2019t are not. In our view, it is time to dispense with the term once and for all.",
            "Social priming occurs when exposure to a social concept or stimulus affects later behaviour. One problem is that there is no clear social component to much of what is defined as social priming (in priming with numbers or the idea of death, for example). And many studies that are obviously social (such as priming with stereotypes) are excluded.",
            "Furthermore, those studies identified as social priming almost exclusively collect a single response to a single prime per subject, whereas others that collect hundreds of responses to multiple primes are excluded from analyses of social priming. Thus, social-priming studies have less power to detect real effects and are more prone to false positives.",
            "Dozens of priming effects using social stimuli are designed to observe multiple behaviours and are highly replicable. But when a non-social priming study measures only a single response per subject, the effects are \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 weak and unreliable (see A. M. Rivers and J. W. Sherman Preprint at PsyArXiv http://doi.org/dng4; 2018).",
