HCoV-NL63 is mainly associated with the common cold in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients (2, 3). The genome of HCoV-NL63 is about 27 kb with a conserved gene order of 5=-orf1ab-spike (S)-orf3-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N)-poly (A). The species tropism of HCoV-NL63 is determined by spike glycoprotein.

This study was performed in strict accordance with human subject protection guidance provided by the Research Ethics Committee of Guangzhou Medical University. The respiratory samples were filtered with 0.22-\u242em filters, RNA extraction was performed using a Qiagen viral RNA extraction kit, and extracted RNA was used for sequenceindependent single-primer amplification (SISPA) (6, 7) as follows: a reverse transcription reaction was performed with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase using a primer containing a fixed sequence, followed by a random hexamer at the 3= end (FR26RV, GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNN). Then, Klenow fragment polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used for DNA synthesis. Finally, PCR amplification was conducted using primers consisting of the fixed portions of the random primers (FR26, GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC). Purified DNA was used for next-generation sequencing (NGS). Libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT kit (Illumina), and paired-end reads (2 \u03eb 125 bp) determined using a HiSeq 2500 instrument were used for cleaning and assembling using CLC Genomics Workbench version 11.0. Illumina sequencing yielded about 10 million reads per sample. Reads were assembled into contigs with a de novo assembly model, and the contig sequences were then extracted for subsequent analysis.
