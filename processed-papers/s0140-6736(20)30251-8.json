        "abstract": "Background In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\nMethods We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.",

As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed."

Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.

            "The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99\u00b798% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.<br/><br/>Interpretation 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation."

Both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of the S1 domain can bind to host receptors.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] We inspected amino acid variation in the spike protein among the Sarbecovirus coronaviruses (figure 4). Although 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV fell within different clades (figure 3), they still possessed around 50 conserved amino acids in S1, whereas most of the bat-derived viruses displayed mutational differences (figure 4). Most of these positions in the C-terminal domain (figure 4). In addition, a number of deletion events, including positions 455\u2013457, 463\u2013464, and 485\u2013497, were found in the bat-derived strains (figure 4).",
            "The receptor-binding domain of betacoronaviruses, which directly engages the receptor, is commonly located in the C-terminal domain of S1, as in SARS-CoV29 for lineage B, and MERS-CoV30,31 and BatCoV HKU4,32 for lineage C (figure 5). Through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses (appendix p 4), we found that, although 2019-nCoV was closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 at the whole-genome level, the receptor-binding domain of 2019-nCoV fell within lineage B and was closer to that of SARS-CoV (figure 5A). The three-dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV receptorbinding domain was modelled using the Swiss-Model program[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] with the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2DD8)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] as a template. This analysis suggested that, like other betacoro\u00ad naviruses, the receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain (figure 5B\u2013D).",
            "Notably, the external subdomain of the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain was more similar to that of SARS-CoV. This result suggests that 2019-nCoV might also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor. However, we also observed that several key residues responsible for the binding of the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain to the ACE2 receptor were variable in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain (including Asn[439], Asn[501], Gln[493], Gly[485] and Phe486; 2019-nCoV numbering)."

        "Discussion": [
            "From genomic surveillance of clinical samples from patients with viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus (termed 2019-nCoV) has been identified.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Our phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV, sequenced from nine patients\u2019 samples, showed that the virus belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. 2019-nCoV was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, than to known human-infecting coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003.",
            "Epidemiologically, eight of the nine patients in our study had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting that they might have been in close contact with the infection source at the market. However, one patient had never visited the market, although he had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness. This finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source. Evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers has now confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Clearly, this infection is a major public health concern, particularly as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the Chinese www.thelancet.com Vol 395 February 22, 2020",
            "Spring Festival travel rush, during which hundreds of millions of people will travel through China.",
            "As a typical RNA virus, the average evolutionary rate for coronaviruses is roughly 10\u20134 nucleotide substitutions per site per year,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] with mutations arising during every replication cycle. It is, therefore, striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV from different patients described here were almost identical, with greater than 99\u00b79% sequence identity. This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very short period and was detected relatively rapidly. However, as the virus transmits to more individuals, constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed.",
            "Phylogenetic analysis showed that bat-derived corona\u00ad viruses fell within all five subgenera of the genus Betacoronavirus. Moreover, bat-derived coronaviruses fell in basal positions in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, with 2019-nCoV most closely related to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were also sampled from bats.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and for 2019-nCoV in particular. However, despite the importance of bats, several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans. First, the outbreak was first reported in late December, 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%, which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV. Fourth, in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats acted as the natural reservoir, with another animal (masked palm civet for SARS-CoV35 and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] acting as an intermediate host, with humans as terminal hosts. Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market.",
            "Previous studies have uncovered several receptors that different coronaviruses bind to, such as ACE2 for SARS-CoV29 and CD26 for MERS-CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] Our molecular modelling showed structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Therefore, we suggest that 2019-nCoV might use ACE2 as the receptor, despite the presence of amino acid mutations in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain. Although a previous study using HeLa cells expressing ACE2 proteins showed that 2019-nCoV could employ the ACE2 receptor,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] whether these mutations affect ACE2 binding or change receptor tropism requires further study.",
