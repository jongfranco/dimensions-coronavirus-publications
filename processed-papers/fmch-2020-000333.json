National authorities and the WHO are monitoring the development very closely, and international resources and expertise are being pooled together to fight the battle.",
            "Like many other family doctors from Hong Kong, we reminisce on the latest outbreak. We have learnt a painful lesson from the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak 17 years ago. Since that 2003 fatal outbreak, the role of family doctors in risk reduction and preparedness to medical emergency has gained recognition both locally and globally.",
            "We need to emphasise and appreciate the functions of family doctors and the primary care teams in early case detection and public education during emergencies. We need to acknowledge the pivotal role of community-\u00ad based practitioners who are competent, professional and responsible. We also need to depart from the traditional hospital-c\u00adentred concept. In China, many patients still flock to hospitals for suspected chest infections or fever. Policies to keep patients in the community are evolving following the issue of new guidelines for isolations and quarantine.",
            "There are many opportunities for family doctors to contribute during medical emergencies.",
            "Family doctors as gatekeepers: \u2019First in, Last out\u2019 Family doctors are often the first contacts of patients and are thus \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 in the fight against outbreaks. As trusted and respected members of communities, family doctors can improve knowledge and understanding of risks and can, through their consultations and engagement with government and leaders, communicate those risks and opportunities for mitigating them to the public in an accurate and truthful way.",
            "Family doctors have a \u2018first in, last out\u2019 role. They always stand in the forefront. As well they are also the ones who manage the aftermath of contingencies. Outbreaks would bring long-\u00adlasting consequences to both the physical and psychological health of a community, from one generation to another. Successive generations of family doctors continue to provide care and treatment.",
            "Mental problems arising from outbreaks, such as post-t\u00adraumatic stress disorders, would be as devastating as physical health problems. Family doctors are in the best position to offer guidance and counselling to patients who will not feel stigmatised by seeking help from his or her trusted family doctor.",
            "Family doctors as primary care coordinators Family doctors are coordinators of primary care teams. They can work together with other professionals and authorities to ensure appropriate actions are taken promptly to reduce risks. However, let us not forget the impact of the medical emergencies on the",
            "family doctors themselves. They are not immune from the risks around them or the effects of widespread infection. They can, however, help to mitigate the risks by informing and educating patients and by contributing to community-\u00adbased risk reduction programmes organised by government or non-\u00adgovernmental organisations.",
            "Family doctors empower the systems through training and new modes of practice In order to gain the trust of the public and other professionals, family doctors must demonstrate competency through continuous training and professional development. We need to train family doctors across the spectrum of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.",
            "Some significant progress has been made in China, for example. Through the work of the World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) and other professional medical bodies such as the Chinese Medical Doctor Association, structured certification and accreditation of doctors training and community clinics have been introduced.",
            "Family doctors can reach more patients in need through innovative ways of practice. New modes of practice, such as the use of internet and digital health, come into play during challenging times. They can provide information and consultations without face-t\u00ado-\u00adface encounters. This is particularly useful during outbreaks while infections control is a concern and some patients have been quarantined. Some private hospitals and healthcare groups have been providing such services.",
            "The WONCA eHealth Working Group is supporting this development through a pilot assessment and certification programme for an internet-b\u00ad ased consultation service in China. The services allow patients to seek online consultations, and preliminary diagnosis and advice by a joint panel of experts are also available if needed.",
            "As Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO, advocates, \u201cThis is the time for facts, not fear. This is the time for science, not rumours. This is the time for solidarity, not stigma.\u201d Family doctors are committed to leading the primary healthcare teams to combat this medical emergency. We want to keep our patients safe in the community, and we also want to see those who are receiving treatment in hospitals back to our neighbourhood again soon.",
