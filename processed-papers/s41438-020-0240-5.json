        "abstract": "Isatis indigotica (2n = 14) is an important medicinal plant in China. Its dried leaves and roots (called Isatidis Folium and Isatidis Radix, respectively) are broadly used in traditional Chinese medicine for curing diseases caused by bacteria and viruses such as influenza and viral pneumonia. Various classes of compounds isolated from this species have been identified as effective ingredients. Previous studies based on transcriptomes revealed only a few candidate genes for the biosynthesis of these active compounds in this medicinal plant. Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of I. indigotica with a total size of 293.88 Mb and scaffold N50 = 36.16 Mb using single-molecule real-time long reads and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture techniques. We annotated 30,323 highconfidence protein-coding genes. Based on homolog searching and functional annotations, we identified many candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of main active components such as indoles, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids. In addition, we found that some key enzyme-coding gene families related to the biosynthesis of these components were expanded due to tandem duplications, which likely drove the production of these major active compounds and explained why I. indigotica has excellent antibacterial and antiviral activities. Our results highlighted the importance of genome sequencing in identifying candidate genes for metabolite synthesis in medicinal plants.",

            "<strong>Introduction The plant family</strong><br/><br/>Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) comprises over 330 genera and ~3700 species with a worldwide distribution[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Numerous crops are derived from this family, including vegetables (Brassica and Raphanus), ornamentals (Matthiola, Hesperis, and Lobularia), spices (Eutrema and Armoracia), and medicines (Isatis). Based on sequenced genomes, several model species have been developed for diverse studies, including Arabidopsis thaliana for molecular function studies, Brassica for polyploidization and whole-genome duplication (WGD) studies, and Eutrema salsugineum for abiotic tolerancerelated studies. However, genetic biosynthesis of the major active compounds in medicinal plants of this family remains poorly investigated. Isatis indigotica (2n = 14) belongs to tribe Isatideae in lineage II of the family[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. This species is widely cultivated in China as an important medicinal plant because its dried leaves and roots are used as a traditional Chinese medicine for curing diseases and viruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. The major active compounds isolated from this species comprise terpenoids, lignans, and indole alkaloids[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>].

            "DNA extraction and genome sequencing We initially extracted high-quality total DNA from fresh young leaves of a 2-month-old plant artificially cultivated in the greenhouse using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method. We used a SMRTbell Template Prep Kit 1.0 (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) to construct the DNA libraries for PacBio long-read sequencing and sequenced them on a PacBio Sequel system. We obtained a total of four SMRT cells with 39.94 Gb of sequencing data (coverage of 142.71\u00d7) from the PacBio Sequel platform and generated a total of 4.30 million subreads with an N50 read length of 14.9 kb (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). We also prepared paired-end Illumina libraries using an Illumina Genomic DNA Sample Preparation Kit and sequenced them on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten system for error correction and K-mer analysis and generated a total of 37.50 Gb of data and 31.79 Gb of clean data (Supplementary Table S1).<br/><br/>Genome assembly and pseudochromosome construction We initially estimated the genome size of I. indigotica by flow cytometry with Vigna radiata as the reference[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>]. We then used clean Illumina short reads to calculate K-mers (Illumina DNA short read size of 19 bp) by Jellyfish v.2.2.964 to confirm the genome size. The sequencing depth was estimated by determining the highest peak value of the frequency curve of the K-mer occurrence distribution. We used SMRT Link pipeline v.5.1.0.26412 to process the polymerase reads into subreads with readScore = 0.75 and minSubReadLength = 500 and used Canu v.1.665 to correct errors of the PacBio subreads and assemble the corrected reads into contigs after trimming low-quality bases using WTDBG (https://github.com/ ruanjue/wtdbg). We corrected the assembled contigs by using 270 bp PE Illumina data by Pilon v.1.1366 and finally obtained a 293.83 Mb contig-scale assembly with a contig N50 of 1.22 Mb. The genome contained 1162 contigs, and the longest contig was 8.99 Mb with a 38.18% GC content. These contigs were further anchored to chromosomes by the Hi-C technique."

In total, we identified 53.27% of the assembled sequences as repetitive sequences, including 34.67% retrotransposons and 7.37% DNA transposons. Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were found to account for 30.09% of the genome (Supplementary Table S8).

This model was further updated to comprise 22 GBs by merging the four GBs to form two new blocks (K-L and M-N), and the GB boundaries defined by A. thaliana gene loci were also updated[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] (Fig. 1a). Six tribes (Calepineae, Coluteocarpeae, Conringieae, Eutremeae, Isatideae, and Sisymbrieae) of expanded lineage II were found to derive from a common ancestor with the Proto-Calepineae Karyotype (PCK; n = 7).

ACK and PCK shared five similar chromosomes. Thus, they might descend from a common ancestor; alternatively, PCK may have evolved from ACK.",
            "To determine whether the I. indigotica genome sequence also supported tPCK structure in Isatideae, we compared the seven pseudochromosomes of I. indigotica with the A. thaliana genome by LAST and MCScanX. We determined syntenic relationships and constructed the order and orientation of the 22 GBs along the seven pseudochromosomes of the I. indigotica genome (Supplementary Figs. S5, S6). Based on the gene intervals of each GB of A. thaliana, we determined the corresponding intervals and boundaries of each block in I. indigotica and renamed the pseudochromosomes based on Fig. 1a (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S10). The I. indigotica genome has good collinearity in each GB compared with the A. thaliana genome and is consistent with tPCK structure in both order and orientation (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. S5, S6). Furthermore, we carried out sequence alignments between the genomes of I. indigotica and the other three species that might also display tPCK structure (Sisymbrium irio for Sisymbrieae, E. salsugineum for Eutremeae, and Schrenkiella parvula for unassigned genera) using LAST. Our analyses suggested that these four species have similar chromosome structures (Supplementary Figs. S7\u2013S9). However, we found obvious inversions in the S. parvula genome and low continuity of sequences in the E. salsugineum and S. irio genomes. These comparisons suggest that the present I. indigotica genome was better assembled in terms of both accuracy and continuity than others with tPCK structure.",

A total of 24,382 I. indigotica genes (80.41%) clustered into 18,900 gene families, of which 10,826 (57.28%) gene families were shared with nine other species and 896 (4.74%) were I. indigotica specific (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table S11). We selected 822 single-copy gene families among 10 species to construct a phylogenetic tree, which showed that I. indigotica was sister to S. irio. We further estimated the divergence time between them as 15.86 (12.71\u201319.20) million years ago (Mya) (Fig. 2a). The relationships of all 10 species are consistent with those from previous phylogenetic analyses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",

A density plot of Ks values for the collinear gene pairs suggested that I. indigotica experienced a recent WGD event with a peak value of ~0.76, consistent with At-\u03b1-WGD for all Brassicaceae species[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>].

Whole-genome alignment among the I. indigotica, A. thaliana, and B. rapa genomes carried out by LAST also confirmed the collinear relationship and these WGD events. For each genomic region of I. indigotica, we typically found one matching region in A. thaliana and three matching regions in B. rapa. These comparisons suggest that I. indigotica did not experience an independent WGD event after At-\u03b1-WGD (Supplementary Figs. S5, S10).",
            "The expansion and contraction of gene families play critical roles in driving phenotypic diversification and enhancing special traits in plants.

In addition, the intermediate product geranyl diphosphate can be used not only to synthesize sterols but also to produce secologanin for monoterpene indole alkaloids in numerous medicinal plants such as Catharanthus roseus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. However, we annotated genes only with geraniol 10-hydroxylase activity (GO: 0102811).

A total of 97.22% of the genes examined by BUSCO were complete, and the chromosome structure of I. indigotica was consistent with the tPCK type.",
            "We constructed the phylogenetic relationships of I. indigotica based on genomic data and found that I. indigotica of Isatideae is sister to S. irio of Sisymbrieae among the sampled species, consistent with the results of previously published phylogenetic analyses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Based on the phylogenetic results, we identified expanded and contracted gene families in I. indigotica. The expanded genes in this species were mainly derived from tandem duplications and were obviously enriched in some secondary metabolite pathways. Based on homolog searching and functional annotation in our high-quality genome, we further identified candidate genes for the biosynthesis of three main classes of active compounds in I. indigotica: terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and indole alkaloids. These candidate genes complete or replenish gene sets for biosynthetic pathways of these compounds concentrated in I. indigotica[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] (Fig. 3). In addition, we found that in some synthesis steps, the copy number of enzyme-coding genes increased to two or more because of tandem duplications. The increase in copy number may drive the production of major active compounds in I. indigotica and account for its excellent antibacterial and antiviral activities because gene expansions are responsible for enhancing a special trait or the origin of a new trait[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>].",
            "Overall, in this study, we present a high-quality genome for I. indigotica. We further identify or replenish candidate genes for biosynthesis pathways of the active compounds in this medicinal plant. These genes and genomic resources will provide a solid basis for future biosynthesisrelated studies."

            "DNA extraction and genome sequencing We initially extracted high-quality total DNA from fresh young leaves of a 2-month-old plant artificially cultivated in the greenhouse using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method. We used a SMRTbell Template Prep Kit 1.0 (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) to construct the DNA libraries for PacBio long-read sequencing and sequenced them on a PacBio Sequel system. We obtained a total of four SMRT cells with 39.94 Gb of sequencing data (coverage of 142.71\u00d7) from the PacBio Sequel platform and generated a total of 4.30 million subreads with an N50 read length of 14.9 kb (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). We also prepared paired-end Illumina libraries using an Illumina Genomic DNA Sample Preparation Kit and sequenced them on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten system for error correction and K-mer analysis and generated a total of 37.50 Gb of data and 31.79 Gb of clean data (Supplementary Table S1).",
            "Genome assembly and pseudochromosome construction We initially estimated the genome size of I. indigotica by flow cytometry with Vigna radiata as the reference[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>]. We then used clean Illumina short reads to calculate K-mers (Illumina DNA short read size of 19 bp) by Jellyfish v.2.2.964 to confirm the genome size. The sequencing depth was estimated by determining the highest peak value of the frequency curve of the K-mer occurrence distribution. We used SMRT Link pipeline v.5.1.0.26412 to process the polymerase reads into subreads with readScore = 0.75 and minSubReadLength = 500 and used Canu v.1.665 to correct errors of the PacBio subreads and assemble the corrected reads into contigs after trimming low-quality bases using WTDBG (https://github.com/ ruanjue/wtdbg). We corrected the assembled contigs by using 270 bp PE Illumina data by Pilon v.1.1366 and finally obtained a 293.83 Mb contig-scale assembly with a contig N50 of 1.22 Mb. The genome contained 1162 contigs, and the longest contig was 8.99 Mb with a 38.18% GC content. These contigs were further anchored to chromosomes by the Hi-C technique.",
            "We grounded ~3 g of fresh young leaf tissue into powder in liquid nitrogen for Hi-C experiments and constructed a Hi-C library following Louwers et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>] with chromatin extraction and digestion and DNA ligation, purification, and fragmentation. Finally, we obtained a total of 79.43 Gb of clean reads for Hi-C analyses by the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform. We first carried out a preliminary assembly by splitting contigs into segments of 100 kb on average and mapping the Hi-C data to the contigs using BWA v.0.7.10-r78968 in order to correct contig errors. We then used LACHESIS software[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>] with the parameters CLUSTER MIN RE SITES = 22, CLUSTER MAX LINK DENSITY = 2, CLUSTER NONINFORMATIVE RATIO = 2, ORDER MIN N RES IN TRUN = 10, and ORDER MIN N RES IN SHREDS = 10 to cluster and reorder all corrected contigs into pseudochromosomes. We finally adjusted the order and direction of the contigs on the pseudochromosomes by examining their interactions in the Hi-C heatmap. We evaluated the completeness and quality of the final assembled genome through BUSCO v.3.029 tests using gene content from the Embryophyta_odb[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] database[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>].",

RepeatMasker recovered the repeats in the I. indigotica genome through a homologybased repeat search using the ab initio repeat database and Repbase. The overlapping repeats belonging to the same repeat class were combined according to their coordination in the genome. The overlapping repeats belonging to different repeat classes were then split into different types.",
            "To improve gene prediction, we further obtained transcriptomes by sequencing high-quality RNA from mixed fresh leaf, flower, and stem tissues and sequenced them by the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform. We removed adapters and discarded reads with >10% N bases or reads having more than 20% bases of low quality (below 5) using NGS QC Toolkit v.2.3.372 and finally generated 19.87 Gb of clean data. We assembled the de novo and genomeguided transcriptomes with clean reads by Trinity v.2.4.073. We also mapped the RNA-sequencing (RNA-",
            "seq) reads to the assembled genome to obtain the mapping rate through HISAT2 v.2.1.074 to evaluate the completeness of the genome. We run PASA pipeline v.2.1.075 to align the transcripts to the assembled genome to carry out ORF prediction and gene prediction. To train the HMM model for Augustus, we extracted complete, multiexon genes, removed redundant high-identity genes (cut-off all-to-all identity of 70%), and finally generated the best candidate and low-identity gene models for training.",
            "We aligned the RNA-seq data to the hard-masked genome assembly by HISAT274 and used bam2hints in Augustus to generate the intron hint file. We used this hint file to carry out ab initio gene prediction by Augustus v.3.2.276. For homologous prediction, the reference protein sequences of Brassica rapa, Brassica napus, Raphanus sativus, Brassica juncea, and Brassica nigra were downloaded and aligned against the I. indigotica genome using TBLASTN v.2.2.3177 and searched with an e value of 1e\u22125. After filtering lowquality results, gene structure was predicted using GeneWise v.2.4.178. We combined the results from PASA, Augustus and GeneWise to generate the final protein-coding gene set using EVidenceModeler v.1.1.175. To obtain the untranslated regions and alternatively spliced isoforms, we used PASA to update the gff[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] file for two rounds and obtain the final gene models.",

Best-hit BLAST results were then used to define gene functions. We used InterProScan v.5.2564.080 to identify motifs and domains by matching against public databases. We identified GO annotations by using Blast2GO v.4.181 according to the blast results and combined them with InterPro GO entries.

For genes with alternative splicing variants, the longest transcript was selected to represent the gene. Similarities between sequence pairs were calculated using BLASTP v.2.2.3177 with a cut-off e value of 1e\u22125. Additionally, OrthoMCL v.2.0.9 was used with default parameters to assess gene family membership based on overall gene similarity combined with Markov Chain Clustering (MCL) v.14-13783.",

We used C. hassleriana as an outgroup and performed 1000 bootstrap analyses to test the robustness of each branch. We used the Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach in MCMCTREE of PAML v.4.9e87 to estimate divergence time. We calibrated this tree based on the estimated divergence times in the TimeTree database[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>] for C. hassleriana\u2013A. thaliana (35\u201359 Mya), A. thaliana\u2013C. rubella (7.4\u201312.8 Mya), B. rapa\u2013S. parvula (19.3\u201328.6 Mya), and B. rapa\u2013A. thaliana (23.4\u201333.5 Mya).",

We used MCScanX90 with default parameters to identify collinear blocks, each containing at least five collinear gene pairs. To infer WGD events, we used the downstream MCScanX script add_ka_and_ks_to_collinearity.pl to calculate the Ks values between collinear genes among these three genomes. We further performed whole-genome alignment of the three species by LAST v.94691 and constructed a dot plot by the downstream program last-dotplot.",
