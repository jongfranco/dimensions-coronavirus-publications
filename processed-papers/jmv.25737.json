Importance: Understanding the binding behavior of GRP78 can pave the way for drugs that can prevent this interaction between the host cell proteins and the viral protein E6 that crucial for cancer propagation. Once GRP78 binding is inhibited, E6 will be destabilized and prone to a faster degradation rate by the host cell degradation machinery.",

            "HPV is the primary causative agent for cervical cancer and other related diseases. The viral protein E6 is the primary oncogenic protein signal that promotes p53 degradation. Preventing such binding is crucial in fighting against, this cancer-promoting, viral infection. GRP78 is said to cause E6 stabilization in vivo among other host cell and viral proteins. Once bound to GRP78, the HPV E6 is stabilized (saved from the degradation through host cell machinery, proteasome degradation pathway). E6 destabilization is reported to be a cancer-preventing strategy. Inhibiting the GRP78-E6 association would help in cancer cessation after the identification of the binding site. The present work suggests the GRP78-E6 binding site using in silico techniques. Further dynamics simulations and experimental work are required to prove our hypothesis; besides, this work paves the way for exploring GRP78-E6 binding inhibitors to fight against this cancer-promoting viral infection."

            "After predicting the binding site using sequence and structural alignments, testing the binding mode and binding energy is the next step. Haddock webserver (easy interface) is used to test the binding mode, and the potency of the interactions settled between GRP78 SBD\u03b2 (PDB ID: 5E84, chain A) to the full-length HPV E6 protein (PDB ID: 4XR8, chain H). The active residues are defined for GRP78 (I426, T428, V429, V432, T434, F451, S452, V457, and I459) while for the HPV E6 it is the C51:C63 region (C51, I52, V53, Y54, R55, D56, G57, N58, P59, Y60, A61, V62, and C63). Passive residues are selected to be the residues surrounding the active residues for both proteins.",
            "A total of 153 docked structures are clustered into ten different clusters according to HADDOCK scores. The number of structures in every cluster varies from 6 (clusters 8, 9, and 10) up to 43 (cluster 1). The HADDOCK scores for each cluster varies from -68.8 \u00b13.8 (the best-scored cluster 8) to -26.8 \u00b13.2 (the worst scored cluster 7). The top-ranked cluster (cluster 8) is used to follow the docking pose by the aid of PLIP. Table 1 summarizes the interactions established in the first four, top-ranked, docking structures of cluster 8 (top-ranked cluster). The most stable interactions are the 3 H-bonds that created between the R55 of HPV E6 and both T456 and T458 of GRP78. Y60 of HPV E6 form H-bonds to G430 of GRP78 in two (out of 4) docking complexes, while at least 2 Hbonds formed between D56 of HPV E6 and S452 of GRP78 in two complexes (out of 4). Some hydrophobic interactions established between the two proteins upon dockings, such as between V429, F451, and V453 of GRP78 and Y54, D56, and Y60 of HPV E6.",
            "Figure 4 shows one of the docking complexes of cluster 8. GRP78 is represented in a green cartoon with its domain marked in figure 4A (NBD, SBD\u03b1, and SBD\u03b2). HPV E6 is represented in the yellow cartoon with its C51:C63 region in red. H-bonds that formed between the two interacted proteins are expressed in blue dashed lines. As shown in the left panel of figure 4A, the number of H-bonds between GRP78 and HPV E6 is 4 (R55::T456, R55::T458(2), and Y60::G430), while only 1 hydrophobic interaction (Y54::V453) is established upon binding with HADDOCK cluster score of -68.8 \u00b1 3.8. Figure 4B shows how the HPV E6 C51:C63 region (red cartoon) fits inside the SBD\u03b2 of GRP78 (molecular surface) between its loops.",
            "The docking study illustrates how the binding is established between HPV E6 and the chaperone, GRP78, protein. Interestingly, the N-terminal of the HPV E6 lies near the suggested binding site of HPV E6 (figure 4B). Further molecular dynamics study needs to check the contribution of this N-terminal region in GRP78 binding."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "HPV is the primary causative agent for cervical cancer and other related diseases. The viral protein E6 is the primary oncogenic protein signal that promotes p53 degradation. Preventing such binding is crucial in fighting against, this cancer-promoting, viral infection. GRP78 is said to cause E6 stabilization in vivo among other host cell and viral proteins. Once bound to GRP78, the HPV E6 is stabilized (saved from the degradation through host cell machinery, proteasome degradation pathway). E6 destabilization is reported to be a cancer-preventing strategy. Inhibiting the GRP78-E6 association would help in cancer cessation after the identification of the binding site. The present work suggests the GRP78-E6 binding site using in silico techniques. Further dynamics simulations and experimental work are required to prove our hypothesis; besides, this work paves the way for exploring GRP78-E6 binding inhibitors to fight against this cancer-promoting viral infection."
