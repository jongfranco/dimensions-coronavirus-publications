        "abstract": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the primary causative agent that causing porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD). The open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein is a newly discovered non-structural protein in PCV2, which the function in viral pathogenesis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of PCV2 ORF5 protein on autophagy and viral replication. The pEGFP-tagged ORF5 gene was ectopic expressed in PK-15 cells and an ORF5-deficient PCV2 mutant strain (PCV2 ORF5) were used to infected PK-15 cells. This study demonstrated that the ORF5 is essential for the of PCV2-induced autophagy. The ORF5 protein triggers the phosphorylation of PERK, eIF2\u03b1 and the expression of downstream transcription factor ATF4. In addition, ORF5 protein activated the AMPK-ERK1/2-mTOR signaling pathways. These findings suggest that ORF5 play essential roles in the induction of autophagy by PCV2. We further revealed that PCV2 ORF5 promotes viral replication through PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 and AMPK-ERK1/2-mTOR pathways. In conclusion, we showed that PCV2 ORF5 induces autophagy to promote virus replication in PK-15 cells.",

The PK-15 cells were transfected with DsRed-ORF5 or EGFP-ORF5, or infected with PCV2 and ORF5-deficient PCV2 mutant strain (PCV2 ORF5), respectively. Autophagy related factors were detected by laser confocal immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The results showed that the number of cells containing spots in LC3 (autophagic vesicles) after PCV2 infection and expression of ORF5 protein was significantly increased than that of PCV2 ORF5 infection group and control group cells (Figures 1A,B). The ratio of LC3-II to \u03b2-actin was significantly increased in cells after PCV2 infection and ORF5 overexpression (Figures 1C\u2013F). Rapa and TG were used as positive controls. To further investigate the ability of PCV2 ORF5 in inducing autophagy, 4-PBA (4phenylbutyrate, an endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor) was used to treat ORF5-overexpressed PK-15 cells. The result showed that 4-PBA strongly restored ORF5 induced LC3-II activation (Figure 1E). Next, we employed transmission electron microscopy assay to observe DsRed-ORF5 transfected cells. The result showed multiple autophagosomes can be clearly observed in the cytoplasm of the DsRed-ORF5 group cells while the swelling and rounding of endoplasmic reticulum structure was observed around the nucleus (Figure 1G). However, the presence of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm could not be observed from the cells transfected with DsRed plasmid and 4-PBA pretreatment group (Figure 1G). Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCV2 and ORF5 induce autophagy."

The potential function of PCV2 encoding viral proteins has not been fully understood. In the previous study, we demonstrated ORF5 protein of PCV2 is localized to the ER and to induce ERS (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLv_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rLv_et+al_2015_a\">Lv et al, 2015</a>). In this study, we focused on the relationship between ORF5 protein and host autophagy. First, we demonstrated that ORF5 protein induced the phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2\u03b1. In addition, the expression level of transcription factor ATF4 is also induced by ORF5 protein in PK-15 cells. PERK is one of the sensors that transmits UPR signals in ERS (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRon_2007_a\" href=\"#rRon_2007_a\">Ron and Walter, 2007</a>). In following study, we demonstrated that the PCV2 ORF5 protein could also suppress the activation of mTOR pathway, which induces autophagy (Figure 3). It had been reported that Dengue virus (DENV) infection can activate UPR and induce autophagy andPERKeIF2\u03b1 and IRE1\u03b1-JNK signaling pathways increase autophagy and viral load after DENV infection (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2018_a\">Lee et al, 2018</a>). Besides, early infection with dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) triggers PERKmediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPena_2011_a\" href=\"#rPena_2011_a\">Pena and Harris, 2011</a>). PCV2 infection induces ERS and activates the PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathway in UPR, and ERS may play a role in PCV2 infection as part of autophagy and apoptosis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2016_a\">Zhou et al, 2016</a>), as well as the PERK pathway also regulates autophagosome formation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2017_a\">Yang et al, 2017</a>). The Rep and Cap proteins of PCV2 induced UPR by the phosphorylation of PERK with subsequent activation of the eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 pathway (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2017_a\">Zhou et al, 2017</a>). In the present study, we showed that ORF5 protein activates eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 expression by phosphorylating PERK which is consistent with the above studies. We found PCV2 ORF5 phosphorylates PERK and eIF2\u03b1 also up-regulate the expression of LC3II. This might due to the phosphorylation of PERK accumulates eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), which leads to the formation of Atg5/Atg12/Atg16L complex (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKang_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rKang_et+al_2017_a\">Kang et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSong_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rSong_et+al_2018_a\">Song et al, 2018</a>).

However, the mechanism of how autophagy involved in PCV2 replication is still unclear. The ORF5 protein, a newly identified protein encoded by PCV2 has been demonstrated located to the endoplasmic reticulum and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in host cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLv_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rLv_et+al_2015_a\">Lv et al, 2015</a>).

After mammalian synthesis of LC3 (autophagy marker light chain 3), a small stretch of peptide chain at the end of LC3I is cleaved to form LC3II under the catalytic shear of Atg3, Atg4, and Atg7, and this process is a key step in the extension of autophagosome membrane (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFujita_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rFujita_et+al_2008_a\">Fujita et al, 2008</a>).

        "RESULTS": [
            "To investigate whether the ORF5 protein can elicit autophagy and induce the formation of autophagosomes. The PK-15 cells were transfected with DsRed-ORF5 or EGFP-ORF5, or infected with PCV2 and ORF5-deficient PCV2 mutant strain (PCV2 ORF5), respectively. Autophagy related factors were detected by laser confocal immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The results showed that the number of cells containing spots in LC3 (autophagic vesicles) after PCV2 infection and expression of ORF5 protein was significantly increased than that of PCV2 ORF5 infection group and control group cells (Figures 1A,B). The ratio of LC3-II to \u03b2-actin was significantly increased in cells after PCV2 infection and ORF5 overexpression (Figures 1C\u2013F). Rapa and TG were used as positive controls. To further investigate the ability of PCV2 ORF5 in inducing autophagy, 4-PBA (4phenylbutyrate, an endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor) was used to treat ORF5-overexpressed PK-15 cells. The result showed that 4-PBA strongly restored ORF5 induced LC3-II activation (Figure 1E). Next, we employed transmission electron microscopy assay to observe DsRed-ORF5 transfected cells. The result showed multiple autophagosomes can be clearly observed in the cytoplasm of the DsRed-ORF5 group cells while the swelling and rounding of endoplasmic reticulum structure was observed around the nucleus (Figure 1G). However, the presence of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm could not be observed from the cells transfected with DsRed plasmid and 4-PBA pretreatment group (Figure 1G). Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCV2 and ORF5 induce autophagy.",
            "PERK pathway is one of the endoplasmic reticulum pathways that induce the cellular autophagy (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKouroku_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rKouroku_et+al_2007_a\">Kouroku et al, 2007</a>). After overexpression of ORF5 protein, the expression levels of p-PERK, p-eIF2\u03b1, ATF4, and LC3II were detected by immunoblotting. The result demonstrated that p-PERK, p-eIF2\u03b1, ATF4, and LC3II were induced by ORF5. Interestingly, the expression of these host factors were also greatly induced by PCV2 infection, but were lees induced by PCV2 ORF5 infection. The protein expression level of p-PERK, p-eIF2\u03b1, and LC3II in PCV2-infected group cells was higher than that in PCV2 ORF5 infected cells (Figures 2A,B). This result indicates that ORF5 protein activates the phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2\u03b1. To further demonstrate that ORF5 induce autophagy by PERK, the GSK2606414 used to block the PERK pathway and the expression of its downstream factors eIF2\u03b1 and ATF4 was determined. The results showed that the expression of p-eIF2\u03b1 and ATF4 were significantly lower in the GSK2606414 pretreatment group than in the EGFPORF5 transfection group cells (Figures 2C,D). The MTT assay showed that cell viability was no significant affected among those conditions (Figure 2E). Together, those results proved that ORF5 protein avtivates PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 pathway to induce autophagy in PK-15 cells.",
            "As shown in Figures 3A,B, the expression of p-mTOR was down-regulated and the expression of LC3 was up-regulated by ORF5 expression in PK-15 cells.

In addition, the PCV2 infection up-regulated",

            "result indicates that ORF5 protein inhibited mTOR pathway and promotes cellular autophagy in PCV2 infected cells.",
            "The phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 and the expression of LC3II protein were significantly up-regulated by ORF5 overexpression in PK-15 cells (Figures 4A,B). Consistently, the p-ERK1/2 and LC3II were induced by PCV2 infection, whereas the expression of p-ERK1/2 and LC3II were less induced by PCV2 ORF5 mutant (Figures 4A,B). The MEK inhibitor U0126 was used to inhibit the ERK1/2 pathway. the results showed that the expression level of p-ERK1/2 and LC3II were down-regulated by MEK inhibitor U0126 (Figures 4C,D). Together, these results indicated that ORF5 protein up-regulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in PK-15 cells.",
            "Next, the expression of AMPK pathway was detected in ORF5 expressing cells. The results showed the phosphorylation of AMPK was strongly induced by ORF5, while the AICAR served as a positive control (Figures 5A,B). Blocking the AMPK pathway with a compound C inhibitor significantly",
            "reduced p-AMPK, p-ERK1/2 and LC3II expression level in EGFP-ORF5 transfection cells, whereas the p-mTOR is increased (Figures 5C,D). The results of laser confocal showed that the number of dot-like aggregation of LC3 are significantly decreased after inhibiting mTOR-ERK1/2-AMPK pathway (Figure 6). Taken together, we demonstrated that ORF5 protein induced autophagy in PCV2-infected cells via the mTOR-ERK1/2AMPK pathway.",
            "By detection of viral genome copy number, we showed the copy number of the PCV2 ORF5 mutant strain was significantly lower compared to PCV2 in infected cells (Figure 7A). Interestingly, the transfection of ORF5 potentiate the replication level of PCV2 (Figure 7A). The inhibition of ERS by 4PBA significantly decreased viral replication, while the TG pretreatment significantly increased PCV2 level (Figure 7B). Consistently, similar results were obtained by using Western blotting to detect PCV2 Cap expression (Figures 7C,D). Together, the results showed that ORF5 and ORF5-induced autophagy increased the PCV2 replications.",
            "The PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 significantly decreased PCV2 replication in ORF5 transfection and PCV2 infected cells (Figure 8A). We further found that the expression of downstream factor ATF4 of the PERK pathway was positively correlated with PCV2 DNA copy number (Figures 8B,C). Western blotting results showed that the PCV2 Cap expression was significantly inhibited by GSK2606414 pretreatment in the EGFP-ORF5 transfection and PCV2 infection group (Figures 8D,E). These results demonstrated that the ORF5 protein increased PCV2 replication and the ORF5 protein promoted the replication of PCV2 via the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 pathway.",
            "PK-15 cells infected with PCV2 and PCV2 ORF5 were pretreated with inhibitors or activators of the mTOR pathway, respectively. The results showed that the DNA copy number in Rapa and AICAR pretreatment groups was significantly increased, whereas the treatment of the compound C and U0126 significantly decreased virus replications (Figure 9A). Furthermore, detecting PCV2 Cap expression showed that Rapa pretreatment significantly stimulated Cap expression (Figures 9B,C). The inhibition of AMPK (compound C) and ERK1/2 (U0126) pathways down-regulated Cap expression. These results confirmed that the ORF5 protein induces cellular autophagy through the mTOR-ERK1/2-AMPK pathway to promote PCV2 replication in PK-15 cells."

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "PCV2 is related to lymphoid degeneration and tissue cell infiltration and induces autophagy (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSinha_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rSinha_et+al_2012_a\">Sinha et al, 2012</a>). The potential function of PCV2 encoding viral proteins has not been fully understood. In the previous study, we demonstrated ORF5 protein of PCV2 is localized to the ER and to induce ERS (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLv_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rLv_et+al_2015_a\">Lv et al, 2015</a>). In this study, we focused on the relationship between ORF5 protein and host autophagy. First, we demonstrated that ORF5 protein induced the phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2\u03b1. In addition, the expression level of transcription factor ATF4 is also induced by ORF5 protein in PK-15 cells. PERK is one of the sensors that transmits UPR signals in ERS (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRon_2007_a\" href=\"#rRon_2007_a\">Ron and Walter, 2007</a>). In following study, we demonstrated that the PCV2 ORF5 protein could also suppress the activation of mTOR pathway, which induces autophagy (Figure 3). It had been reported that Dengue virus (DENV) infection can activate UPR and induce autophagy andPERKeIF2\u03b1 and IRE1\u03b1-JNK signaling pathways increase autophagy and viral load after DENV infection (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2018_a\">Lee et al, 2018</a>). Besides, early infection with dengue virus type 2 (DENV2) triggers PERKmediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPena_2011_a\" href=\"#rPena_2011_a\">Pena and Harris, 2011</a>). PCV2 infection induces ERS and activates the PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathway in UPR, and ERS may play a role in PCV2 infection as part of autophagy and apoptosis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2016_a\">Zhou et al, 2016</a>), as well as the PERK pathway also regulates autophagosome formation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2017_a\">Yang et al, 2017</a>). The Rep and Cap proteins of PCV2 induced UPR by the phosphorylation of PERK with subsequent activation of the eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 pathway (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2017_a\">Zhou et al, 2017</a>). In the present study, we showed that ORF5 protein activates eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 expression by phosphorylating PERK which is consistent with the above studies. We found PCV2 ORF5 phosphorylates PERK and eIF2\u03b1 also up-regulate the expression of LC3II. This might due to the phosphorylation of PERK accumulates eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), which leads to the formation of Atg5/Atg12/Atg16L complex (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKang_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rKang_et+al_2017_a\">Kang et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSong_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rSong_et+al_2018_a\">Song et al, 2018</a>). The LC3I is hydrolyzed and cleaved into an active LC3II, thereby mediating the extension of the autophagosome membrane.",
            "The mTOR-ERK1/2-AMPK is also found affected by ORF5 protein in this study. AMPK plays an important role in the regulation of autophagy and proteolysis in mammalian cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMeley_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rMeley_et+al_2006_a\">Meley et al, 2006</a>) and autophagy induced by non-starvationrelated factors act primarily through activation of AMPK (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHoyer-Hansen_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rHoyer-Hansen_et+al_2007_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHoyer-Hansen_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rHoyer-Hansen_et+al_2007_a\">Hoyer-Hansen et al, 2007</a></a>).

These opposite effects are due to complex intermodulation and constraints among the AMPK, ERK1/2, and mTOR signaling pathways. ORF5 induces phosphorylation of AMPK, thereby enhancing the activity of ERK1/2, but negatively regulating mTOR since inhibiting the phosphorylation of mTOR, the cleavage of LC3-I to LC3-II is enhanced, and the autophagy is induced.",
            "Some viruses can promote their own replication and maturation by converting the Atg5/Atg12/Atg16L complex to LC3, which is the major component of autophagy (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDoring_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rDoring_et+al_2018_a\">Doring et al, 2018</a>). Autophagosomes promotes virus replication, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2011_a\">Li et al, 2011</a>), adenovirus (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRodriguez-Rocha_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rRodriguez-Rocha_et+al_2011_a\">Rodriguez-Rocha et al, 2011</a>) and encephalomyocarditis virus (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhang_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rZhang_et+al_2011_a\">Zhang et al, 2011</a>). Some RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm can apply the bilayer membrane structure of autophagic vacuoles as a site of attachment to resist cell clearance. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (Coronavirus, SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) can simultaneously detect LC3 II and virus in autophagosomes after infection of cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cde_Haan_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rde_Haan_et+al_2010_a\">de Haan et al, 2010</a>). In conjunction with that PCV2 promotes its own replication by autophagy, ORF5 protein phosphorylates the PERK-eIF2\u03b1 pathway and activates the expression of the downstream factor ATF4, which significantly increases the viral capsid protein as well as the PCV2 DNA copy number, the replication capacity of PCV2 is reduced when PERK was blocked by GSK2606414. This indicates that ERS produced by ORF5 promotes the formation of autophagosomes and has a beneficial effect on the replication of PCV2. This consistent with previous studies that PCV2 infection of PK-15 cells induces autophagy and significantly decreases",
            "PCV2 virus titer after interfering with autophagy (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhu_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rZhu_et+al_2012_a\">Zhu et al, 2012a</a>,b). Again, it demonstrated that ORF5 protein affects PCV2 replication through the PERK pathway. Phosphorylation of AMPK is reduced while phosphorylation of mTOR is induced when ERK1/2 blocked, resulting in the DNA copy number of PCV2 decreased and inhibiting DNA replication. On the contrary, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AMPK promotes replication of PCV2 after inhibition of mTOR by Rapa, it confirmed that the ORF5 protein enhances its own replication by inducing autophagy.",
            "Although we have studied the relationship between ORF5 protein, autophagy and viral replication, there are still some issues need further investigation. Even though PCV2 infection can activate both TSC2 and ERK1/2 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhu_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rZhu_et+al_2012_a\">Zhu et al, 2012a</a>), the relationship between ERK1/2 and TSC2 and the interaction between ORF5 protein and TSC2 still remains unknown.",

            "PCV2 is related to lymphoid degeneration and tissue cell infiltration and induces autophagy (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSinha_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rSinha_et+al_2012_a\">Sinha et al, 2012</a>).",
            "The authors demonstrated that ORF5 protein induced the phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2\u03b1.",
            "The authors demonstrated that the PCV2 ORF5 protein could suppress the activation of mTOR pathway, which induces autophagy (Figure 3).",
