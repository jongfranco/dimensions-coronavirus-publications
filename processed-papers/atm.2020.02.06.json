            "Although more data would need to be collected for accurately portend the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak, the clinical features have been recently described in 41 Chinese patients hospitalized in Wuhan, where the infection has begun (10). Briefly, the mean age of patients was 49 (interquartile range, 41-58) years, male sex was prevalent (73%), and nearly half of patients had an underlying pathology (20% diabetes, 15% hypertension or cardiovascular disease). The most frequent symptoms included fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnoea (55%), myalgia (44%), whilst headache (8%) and diarrhoea (3%) were less common. Notably, all patients developed pneumonia, confirmed by the presence of abnormal chest CT findings. The most frequent complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome (29%), and acute cardiac injury (12%). Thirty two percent of these patients ought to be admitted to the intensive care unit, whilst 15% of them died. According to the last WHO report, the clinical picture of patients diagnosed outside China is substantially similar, with a mean age of infection onset of 45 (range, 2 to 74) years, and a higher prevalence of men vs. women (71% vs. 29%) (8). The median period between first onset of the symptoms and death has been estimated at 14 (range, 6\u201341) days, nearly half shorter in elderly people (i.e., in those aged 70-year old or older; 11 vs. 20 days; P=0.033) (11). The median age of those who died for this infection appeared substantially high (75 years; range, 48\u201389 years), and most patients (up to two-third) had important comorbidities.",
            "Despite the WHO has recently raised the level of global risk of this outbreak from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201chigh\u201d (\u201cvery high\u201d in China), and many health authorities are taking prompt public health measures worldwide to face the challenge, this latest CoV outbreak shall now be seen as a global health concern. Urgent preventive measures shall be planned and, especially, rapid diagnostic tools shall be made available. Among the various options, it seems reasonable to conclude that amplification and detection of 2019-nCoV using specific sequences may be preferable, since direct virus identification would then exclude the need of additional sequencing. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently published an interim guidance for clinical laboratories, containing real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) primers and probes, which shall be used for purposes of epidemic surveillance (14). Contextually, the WHO has also released another interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis of infection, which includes recommendations for sample collection, handling and storage, as well as indications on 2019-nCoV detection, accompanied by a list of currently available protocols (15)."
