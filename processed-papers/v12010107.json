        "abstract": "A majority of emerging infectious diseases are of zoonotic origin. Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) has been employed to identify uncommon and novel infectious etiologies and characterize virus diversity in human, animal, and environmental samples. Here, we systematically reviewed studies that performed viral mNGS in common livestock (cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs). We identified 2481 records and 120 records were ultimately included after a first and second screening. Pigs were the most frequently studied livestock and the virus diversity found in samples from poultry was the highest. Known animal viruses, zoonotic viruses, and novel viruses were reported in available literature, demonstrating the capacity of mNGS to identify both known and novel viruses. However, the coverage of metagenomic studies was patchy, with few data on the virome of small ruminants and respiratory virome of studied livestock. Essential metadata such as age of livestock and farm types were rarely mentioned in available literature, and only 10.8% of the datasets were publicly available. Developing a deeper understanding of livestock virome is crucial for detection of potential zoonotic and animal pathogens and One Health preparedness. Metagenomic studies can provide this background but only when combined with essential metadata and following the \u201cFAIR\u201d (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles.",
        "references": "@misc{unknown-a,\n  title = {Although the global population of goats and sheep exceeds that of pigs [138], only nine mNGS studies of samples from small ruminants were identified in our review and hence it is not surprising that reported virus diversity of small ruminants was the lowest when compared to other common farm animals. Even though zoonoses from small ruminants such as chlamydiosis are thought to be transmitted via direct contact, the example of Q fever has shown the potential for spread by inhalation of contaminated aerosol [139]. The largest Dutch Q-fever outbreak in 2007\u20132010 with more than 3500 cases certainly indicated that zoonotic risk from small ruminants should not be underestimated [18], and in line with the predominance of viruses as causes of emerging disease outbreaks, studies are needed to characterize the virome of small ruminants and its possible relationship to the health and disease of exposed humans},\n  language = {}\n}\n@142{unknown-b,\n  title = {The viromes of farm animals in health and disease in the reviewed mNGS studies were relatively comparable. It could be that some infections were subclinical, for instance, porcine noroviruses and rotaviruses have been found in asymptomatic pigs as well as diarrheic pigs [140,141]. Also, as the major clinical syndromes can be caused by a range of pathogens, it is unlikely that a single predominant virus would be found in diseased animals, unless it would be a highly prevalent disease cause. This highlights the challenge in incorporating complex viral metagenomic data in disease association studies. In addition, disease association studies require deeper taxonomic annotation of virus sequences to the level of genus and species, which can be challenging with short read data provided by the most commonly used sequencing platforms, although sequence assembly methods have been improved considerably},\n  medium = {142},\n  language = {}\n}\n@misc{unknown-c,\n  title = {Supplementary Materials: Supplementary materials are},\n  url = {http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/1/107/s1.},\n  language = {}\n}\n@article{jones2008a,\n  author = {Jones, K.E. and Patel, N.G. and Levy, M.A. and Storeygard, A. and Balk, D. and Gittleman, J.L. and Daszak, P.},\n  title = {Global trends in emerging infectious diseases},\n  journal = {Nature},\n  date = {2008},\n  volume = {451},\n  pages = {990\u2013993},\n  medium = {CrossRef},\n  language = {}\n}\n@article{wolfe2007a,\n  author = {Wolfe, N.D. and Dunavan, C.P. and Diamond, J.},\n  title = {Origins of major human infectious diseases},\n  journal = {Nature},\n  date = {2007},\n  volume = {447},\n  pages = {279\u2013283},\n  medium = {CrossRef},\n  language = {}\n}\n@article{jones2013a,\n  author = {Jones, B.A. and Grace, D. and Kock, R. and Alonso, S. and Rushton, J. and Said, M.Y. and McKeever, D. and Mutua, F. and Young, J. and McDermott, J.},\n  title = {Zoonosis emergence linked to agricultural intensification and environmental change},\n  journal = {Proc.

Even though zoonoses from small ruminants such as chlamydiosis are thought to be transmitted via direct contact, the example of Q fever has shown the potential for spread by inhalation of contaminated aerosol [139]. The largest Dutch Q-fever outbreak in 2007\u20132010 with more than 3500 cases certainly indicated that zoonotic risk from small ruminants should not be underestimated [18], and in line with the predominance of viruses as causes of emerging disease outbreaks, studies are needed to characterize the virome of small ruminants and its possible relationship to the health and disease of exposed humans\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - GEN\nTI  - The viromes of farm animals in health and disease in the reviewed mNGS studies were relatively comparable. It could be that some infections were subclinical, for instance, porcine noroviruses and rotaviruses have been found in asymptomatic pigs as well as diarrheic pigs [140,141]. Also, as the major clinical syndromes can be caused by a range of pathogens, it is unlikely that a single predominant virus would be found in diseased animals, unless it would be a highly prevalent disease cause. This highlights the challenge in incorporating complex viral metagenomic data in disease association studies. In addition, disease association studies require deeper taxonomic annotation of virus sequences to the level of genus and species, which can be challenging with short read data provided by the most commonly used sequencing platforms, although sequence assembly methods have been improved considerably\nC1  - 142\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - GEN\nTI  - Supplementary Materials: Supplementary materials are\nUR  - http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/1/107/s1.\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - JOUR\nAU  - Jones, K.E.\nAU  - Patel, N.G.\nAU  - Levy, M.A.\nAU  - Storeygard, A.\nAU  - Balk, D.\nAU  - Gittleman, J.L.\nAU  - Daszak, P.\nTI  - Global trends in emerging infectious diseases\nT2  - Nature\nPY  - 2008\nDA  - 2008\nVL  - 451\nSP  - 990\nEP  - 993\nC1  - CrossRef\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - JOUR\nAU  - Wolfe, N.D.\nAU  - Dunavan, C.P.\nAU  - Diamond, J.\nTI  - Origins of major human infectious diseases\nT2  - Nature\nPY  - 2007\nDA  - 2007\nVL  - 447\nSP  - 279\nEP  - 283\nC1  - CrossRef\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - JOUR\nAU  - Jones, B.A.\nAU  - Grace, D.\nAU  - Kock, R.\nAU  - Alonso, S.\nAU  - Rushton, J.\nAU  - Said, M.Y.\nAU  - McKeever, D.\nAU  - Mutua, F.\nAU  - Young, J.\nAU  - McDermott, J.\nTI  - Zoonosis emergence linked to agricultural intensification and environmental change\nT2  - Proc.

In the past decades, high impact outbreaks have occurred with introductions from wildlife and livestock reservoirs, respectively, exemplified by the wildlife-borne outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], Nipah disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], and Lassa fever [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], and outbreaks resulting from contact with livestock animals, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS] [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], avian influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], Rift Valley fever [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], and swine influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Livestock animals that live in close proximity to humans can facilitate transmission of infectious diseases through the wildlife-livestock-human interface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>Intensification of livestock farming is widely practiced in support of increasing food demand due to human population growth. This, in turn, facilitates disease transmissions within herds and between livestock and humans by increasing livestock population and density [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Therefore, the potential emergence of zoonoses from livestock population should not be underestimated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].

            "The rapid and extensive development of NGS has opened up more opportunities to advance understanding in infectious disease diagnostics, surveillance, and transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c133\" href=\"#r133\">133</a>]. One of the key NGS applications is the primer-independent, agnostic (i.e., without prior knowledge) viral metagenomics to characterize all viruses present in the samples, and also allow the discovery of novel or uncommon infectious etiologies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c134\" href=\"#r134\">134</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c135\" href=\"#r135\">135</a>]. In this review, we summarize previous studies that performed viral mNGS in common farm animals including cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs in an effort to provide background virus diversity profiles of these farm animals. Information systematically summarized from this review will help to guide the design of future studies employing mNGS for surveillance as well as preparedness for detection of diseases at the livestock-human interface.<br/><br/>The majority of available farm animal viral mNGS literature studied pigs, which may be explained by the emergence and global spread of swine viruses such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c136\" href=\"#r136\">136</a>] and African Swine Fever virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c137\" href=\"#r137\">137</a>] in the recent decade. Indeed, these viruses were reported in our included studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>]. Other mNGS studies also found hepatitis E viruses in pigs, known to be zoonotic. In addition to these known animal viruses, a wide range of other viruses have been described in different livestock by using mNGS, highlighting the potential for using mNGS to identify not only viruses that affect the animals, but also zoonotic and novel viruses."

Reporting bias might be introduced with different study objectives and research interests, the use of different algorithms for metagenomic analysis, reference databases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c143\" href=\"#r143\">143</a>], and different sample preparation strategies (e.g., presence/absence of nuclease treatment, filtration and random amplification, different sizes of filters used, and centrifugation strategies) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c144\" href=\"#r144\">144</a>]. Some studies performed pooling among samples from different farms. This practice is cost-effective for a resource-limited setting, however viruses with low abundance may be diluted and missed. About 90% of studies did not provide raw sequencing data on SRA or ENA which hampers cross-study comparison and future large-scale reanalysis and interpretation. This is crucial, as it has been shown that outputs from metagenomic workflows are not directly comparable with the use of different algorithms and reference databases. Data sharing is also warranted for successful pathogen surveillance and outbreak detection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c145\" href=\"#r145\">145</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c146\" href=\"#r146\">146</a>] and our review shows that there is much to be gained in the field of metagenomics. It was difficult to compare virome composition of farm animals from different farm types and of different ages in available studies. Over 80% and 40% of available studies did not specify farm type and age of farm animals. We observed that metadata availability is consistently lacking in available literature regardless of different study types. Our review shows that the current state of the art is far from providing such information as the minimal metadata that is needed to select datasets for analysis is rarely provided with published reports. In the longer term, a better understanding of the association between farm types and virome composition of farm animals would guide farm management practices for reducing risks from zoonoses. In the meantime, it is important to benchmark metagenomic tools and reference databases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c147\" href=\"#r147\">147</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c148\" href=\"#r148\">148</a>] and assess epidemic potential of pathogens for more accurate zoonoses prediction and detection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c149\" href=\"#r149\">149</a>].",
            "These aforementioned limitations of the reviewed dataset may hinder the reusability of the published metagenomic data. An incredible amount of metagenomics data is being generated these days as we speak, given reduced costs of sequencing and increased availability of NGS platforms. Therefore, timing is perfect to take one step further to implement good data management practices referred as the \u201cFAIR\u201d (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c151\" href=\"#r151\">151</a>]. In brief, data should be properly indexed and easy to find and assess. Data should also be described with rich and well-defined metadata that can be interpreted by humans and computers. By making metagenomic data \u201cFAIR\u201d, reusability of the data can be optimized so the data can be combined into meta-analysis settings. Minimum datasets for the sharing of pathogen genomic data have already been established through the global microbial identifier project [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c152\" href=\"#r152\">152</a>]. We propose to always include breed types, age of the animals, and farm types in the minimal metadata set to allow determination of viral fingerprints of different farm animals. More \u201cFAIR\u201d metagenomic data of farm animals would be favorable for future large-scale farm animal virome characterization analysis that can guide zoonotic outbreak preparedness."

            "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are responsible for a substantial burden of mortality and morbidity globally, and a majority of EIDs (60.3%) are caused by zoonotic pathogens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. In the past decades, high impact outbreaks have occurred with introductions from wildlife and livestock reservoirs, respectively, exemplified by the wildlife-borne outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], Nipah disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], and Lassa fever [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], and outbreaks resulting from contact with livestock animals, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS] [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], avian influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], Rift Valley fever [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], and swine influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Livestock animals that live in close proximity to humans can facilitate transmission of infectious diseases through the wildlife-livestock-human interface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
            "Intensification of livestock farming is widely practiced in support of increasing food demand due to human population growth. This, in turn, facilitates disease transmissions within herds and between livestock and humans by increasing livestock population and density [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Therefore, the potential emergence of zoonoses from livestock population should not be underestimated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In 2003, there was an outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza A subtype H7N7 in humans linked to multiple commercial poultry farms in the Netherlands [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Two years later, another highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 virus emerged in Asia in 2005, probably as a result of frequent mixing between",
            "Viruses 2020, 12, 107 flocks and wild birds, suggesting that pre-existing biosecurity measurements could not keep up with the rate of livestock intensification [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. In 2007\u20132010, a large-scale Q fever outbreak was reported in the Netherlands, affecting more than 3500 human cases and resulting in a huge economic loss [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. A steep increase in the number of goat farms most likely was the driver for the increased prevalence of Coxiella burnetii infections, with animal abortion waves that had gone unnoticed. The policy of voluntary reporting abortion outbreaks to the Animal Health Service hindered the timely detection of the circulation of Q fever, and therefore early interventions. These examples indicate that zoonotic risks in the livestock industry should be carefully managed and adapted to livestock intensification. The One Health approach has been coined for advocating collaboration between multiple stakeholders including veterinarians, clinicians, epidemiologists, virologists, microbiologists, ecologists, and policy makers to prevent and control EIDs through the human-animal-environment interface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Surveillance of livestock and the surrounding environment is a hallmark of early detection but is currently targeted to known risks.",
            "Advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and rapid development of bioinformatics and computational tools offer new opportunities for EID surveillance in quality and in scale. Particularly, metagenomic NGS (mNGS) allows unbiased detection of all microbes and viruses in a sample, showing potential for timely detection of rare or novel infectious etiologies, as well as for surveillance of foodborne and waterborne viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. However, the use of mNGS as a potential surveillance tool requires a deeper understanding of what is \u201cnormal\u201d diversity in humans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>], as well as wildlife [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] and farm animals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. Characterizing species-specific metagenomes could potentially be used to provide a surveillance baseline for early detection and for tracking of movements of pathogens across different hosts, and has been promoted by projects like the global virome project [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. However, for such applications, detailed background is needed regarding coverage, representativeness, and biases in the study designs. Here, we conduct a systematic review to identify available literature that performed viral mNGS in common farm animals including cattle, small ruminants (goats and sheep), poultry, and pigs. We reviewed the data and metadata availability and quality of these studies. We further summarized reported viromes of common farm animals in order to translate these efforts as background virus diversity profiles of common farm animals to guide preparedness of diseases at the livestock-human interface."

Geographical origins of included studies were stratified according to World Health Organization (WHO) regions: Africa region, the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean region, European region, South-East Asia region, and the Western Pacific region. Health conditions of farm animals were stratified into four major groups: healthy, gastrointestinal signs, respiratory signs, and other clinical signs. The category \u201cother clinical signs\u201d refers to any clinical signs that could not be classified into the first three categories and unspecified health conditions. Studies were stratified into seven arbitrary types based on their primary findings: virome study (i.e., papers that focused on studying the virus diversity of the animals), genetic characterization, mNGS as a diagnostic tool, mNGS as a diagnostic tool and virome study, virus discovery (i.e., papers that primarily focused on discovery of novel viruses), methodology papers, and others. Sequencing platforms were stratified into four main sequencing platforms: 454 pyrosequencing (Roche), Illumina, Ion Torrent (Thermo Fisher), and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

            "The rapid and extensive development of NGS has opened up more opportunities to advance understanding in infectious disease diagnostics, surveillance, and transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c133\" href=\"#r133\">133</a>]. One of the key NGS applications is the primer-independent, agnostic (i.e., without prior knowledge) viral metagenomics to characterize all viruses present in the samples, and also allow the discovery of novel or uncommon infectious etiologies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c134\" href=\"#r134\">134</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c135\" href=\"#r135\">135</a>]. In this review, we summarize previous studies that performed viral mNGS in common farm animals including cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs in an effort to provide background virus diversity profiles of these farm animals. Information systematically summarized from this review will help to guide the design of future studies employing mNGS for surveillance as well as preparedness for detection of diseases at the livestock-human interface.",
            "The majority of available farm animal viral mNGS literature studied pigs, which may be explained by the emergence and global spread of swine viruses such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c136\" href=\"#r136\">136</a>] and African Swine Fever virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c137\" href=\"#r137\">137</a>] in the recent decade. Indeed, these viruses were reported in our included studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>]. Other mNGS studies also found hepatitis E viruses in pigs, known to be zoonotic. In addition to these known animal viruses, a wide range of other viruses have been described in different livestock by using mNGS, highlighting the potential for using mNGS to identify not only viruses that affect the animals, but also zoonotic and novel viruses.",
            "Although the global population of goats and sheep exceeds that of pigs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c138\" href=\"#r138\">138</a>], only nine mNGS studies of samples from small ruminants were identified in our review and hence it is not surprising that reported virus diversity of small ruminants was the lowest when compared to other common farm animals. Even though zoonoses from small ruminants such as chlamydiosis are thought to be transmitted via direct contact, the example of Q fever has shown the potential for spread by inhalation of contaminated aerosol [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c139\" href=\"#r139\">139</a>]. The largest Dutch Q-fever outbreak in 2007\u20132010 with more than 3500 cases certainly indicated that zoonotic risk from small ruminants should not be underestimated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], and in line with the predominance of viruses as causes of emerging disease outbreaks, studies are needed to characterize the virome of small ruminants and its possible relationship to the health and disease of exposed humans.",
            "The viromes of farm animals in health and disease in the reviewed mNGS studies were relatively comparable. It could be that some infections were subclinical, for instance, porcine noroviruses and rotaviruses have been found in asymptomatic pigs as well as diarrheic pigs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c140\" href=\"#r140\">140</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c141\" href=\"#r141\">141</a>]. Also, as the major clinical syndromes can be caused by a range of pathogens, it is unlikely that a single predominant virus would be found in diseased animals, unless it would be a highly prevalent disease cause. This highlights the challenge in incorporating complex viral metagenomic data in disease association studies. In addition, disease association studies require deeper taxonomic annotation of virus sequences to the level of genus and species, which can be challenging with short read data provided by the most commonly used sequencing platforms, although sequence assembly methods have been improved considerably [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c142\" href=\"#r142\">142</a>].",
            "We showed that Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, and Astroviridae were among the most commonly identified virus families in common farm animals. Therefore, although sample sizes were relatively small, these virus families may be signature viruses to indicate livestock exposure. For instance, Avastrovirus, an avian virus, so far has only been reported in poultry sample metagenomes. Multiple signature viruses would be required to set up a viral fingerprint profile for each livestock type, as one genetic marker may not be sensitive and/or specific enough. In our studies, we aim to identify stable signatures to allow tracking the flow of viruses between different livestock, humans, and the surrounding environment.",
            "There are limitations in our review dataset of the available farm animal mNGS studies. Reporting bias might be introduced with different study objectives and research interests, the use of different algorithms for metagenomic analysis, reference databases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c143\" href=\"#r143\">143</a>], and different sample preparation strategies (e.g., presence/absence of nuclease treatment, filtration and random amplification, different sizes of filters used, and centrifugation strategies) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c144\" href=\"#r144\">144</a>]. Some studies performed pooling among samples from different farms. This practice is cost-effective for a resource-limited setting, however viruses with low abundance may be diluted and missed. About 90% of studies did not provide raw sequencing data on SRA or ENA which hampers cross-study comparison and future large-scale reanalysis and interpretation. This is crucial, as it has been shown that outputs from metagenomic workflows are not directly comparable with the use of different algorithms and reference databases. Data sharing is also warranted for successful pathogen surveillance and outbreak detection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c145\" href=\"#r145\">145</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c146\" href=\"#r146\">146</a>] and our review shows that there is much to be gained in the field of metagenomics. It was difficult to compare virome composition of farm animals from different farm types and of different ages in available studies. Over 80% and 40% of available studies did not specify farm type and age of farm animals. We observed that metadata availability is consistently lacking in available literature regardless of different study types. Our review shows that the current state of the art is far from providing such information as the minimal metadata that is needed to select datasets for analysis is rarely provided with published reports. In the longer term, a better understanding of the association between farm types and virome composition of farm animals would guide farm management practices for reducing risks from zoonoses. In the meantime, it is important to benchmark metagenomic tools and reference databases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c147\" href=\"#r147\">147</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c148\" href=\"#r148\">148</a>] and assess epidemic potential of pathogens for more accurate zoonoses prediction and detection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c149\" href=\"#r149\">149</a>].",
            "Available viral mNGS studies of healthy farm animals primarily focused on fecal virome, probably because fecal samples of farm animals are a non-invasive sample and are readily available to be collected. However, one must notice that recently EIDs are like MERS, such as the avian and swine influenza, and are mostly respiratory related, although viral shedding of MERS coronavirus was also reported in camel and human stools and some MERS patients also experienced diarrhea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c150\" href=\"#r150\">150</a>].",
            "Nonetheless, viral mNGS studies of respiratory samples of farm animals are substantially overlooked and underreported.",
            "To our best knowledge, this is the first systematic review that summarizes available literature that performed viral mNGS in farm animal samples. These aforementioned limitations of the reviewed dataset may hinder the reusability of the published metagenomic data. An incredible amount of metagenomics data is being generated these days as we speak, given reduced costs of sequencing and increased availability of NGS platforms. Therefore, timing is perfect to take one step further to implement good data management practices referred as the \u201cFAIR\u201d (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c151\" href=\"#r151\">151</a>]. In brief, data should be properly indexed and easy to find and assess. Data should also be described with rich and well-defined metadata that can be interpreted by humans and computers. By making metagenomic data \u201cFAIR\u201d, reusability of the data can be optimized so the data can be combined into meta-analysis settings. Minimum datasets for the sharing of pathogen genomic data have already been established through the global microbial identifier project [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c152\" href=\"#r152\">152</a>]. We propose to always include breed types, age of the animals, and farm types in the minimal metadata set to allow determination of viral fingerprints of different farm animals. More \u201cFAIR\u201d metagenomic data of farm animals would be favorable for future large-scale farm animal virome characterization analysis that can guide zoonotic outbreak preparedness.",
            "This review provides an overview of available literature that performed viral mNGS in common livestock including cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs. We summarized virus diversity of these farm animals reported in available literature and reviewed their study designs. This is a good starting point for identifying species signatures for porcine, bovine, and poultry fecal viromes, but major gaps in the data of the virus diversity of small ruminants exist. Given the lack and inconsistency of data and metadata availability in available literature, it is important to apply the \u201cFAIR\u201d data principles in future farm animal mNGS studies or any other related studies for enhancing data reusability. In the longer term, developing a better understanding of farm animal virome is crucial for detection of potential zoonotic pathogens, zoonotic outbreak response, and preparedness [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c153\" href=\"#r153\">153</a>], as well as the preparedness to combat livestock diseases."

Even though zoonoses from small ruminants such as chlamydiosis are thought to be transmitted via direct contact, the example of Q fever has shown the potential for spread by inhalation of contaminated aerosol [139]. The largest Dutch Q-fever outbreak in 2007\u20132010 with more than 3500 cases certainly indicated that zoonotic risk from small ruminants should not be underestimated [18], and in line with the predominance of viruses as causes of emerging disease outbreaks, studies are needed to characterize the virome of small ruminants and its possible relationship to the health and disease of exposed humans.",

It could be that some infections were subclinical, for instance, porcine noroviruses and rotaviruses have been found in asymptomatic pigs as well as diarrheic pigs [140,141]. Also, as the major clinical syndromes can be caused by a range of pathogens, it is unlikely that a single predominant virus would be found in diseased animals, unless it would be a highly prevalent disease cause. This highlights the challenge in incorporating complex viral metagenomic data in disease association studies. In addition, disease association studies require deeper taxonomic annotation of virus sequences to the level of genus and species, which can be challenging with short read data provided by the most commonly used sequencing platforms, although sequence assembly methods have been improved considerably [142].",
