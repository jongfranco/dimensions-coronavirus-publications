It is unclear whether the virus is infective exists during the incubation period, although person-to-person transmission has been reported elsewhere. We report the epidemiological features of a familial cluster of 4 patients in Shanghai, including an 88-year-old man with limited mobility who was exposed only to asymptomatic family members whose symptoms developed later. The epidemiological evidence has shown possible transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus during the incubation period.",

He had not left his apartment for at least 2 weeks before onset of his illness. Five days before that onset, patients 2 and 3 came from Wuhan, the focus of the 2019-nCov epidemic. It was confirmed that patients 2, 3, and 4 had not any symptoms for at least 2 weeks before the onset of illness in patient 1. Although the initial infection sources in patient 1 were most likely patient 2 or 3 during their incubation period, it is also possible that patient 4 was infected by patient 2 or 3 and then infected patient 1 during her incubation period. Because they lived in one bedroom. Thus, the infection source for patient 1 may have been patients 2, 3 and/or 4. The findings indicate that a person with 2019-nCoV might be infectious during the incubation period."

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "In this familial cluster of 2019-nCoV infection, 4 patients were tested and confirmed as 2019-nCoV positive, according to nucleic acid detection. Two of them had radiological changes showing viral pneumonia.",
            "It is worth noting that patient 1 was an 88-year-old man with limited mobility. He had not left his apartment for at least 2 weeks before onset of his illness. Five days before that onset, patients 2 and 3 came from Wuhan, the focus of the 2019-nCov epidemic. It was confirmed that patients 2, 3, and 4 had not any symptoms for at least 2 weeks before the onset of illness in patient 1. Although the initial infection sources in patient 1 were most likely patient 2 or 3 during their incubation period, it is also possible that patient 4 was infected by patient 2 or 3 and then infected patient 1 during her incubation period. Because they lived in one bedroom. Thus, the infection source for patient 1 may have been patients 2, 3 and/or 4. The findings indicate that a person with 2019-nCoV might be infectious during the incubation period.",
            "Zeng and colleagues [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] have reported that SARS cases are infectious only during their symptomatic period and are noninfectious during the incubation period [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Both SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)\u2013CoV infect intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than cells of the upper airways [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Therefore, individuals in close contact with symptomatic patients with SARS should be isolated for medical observation. However, human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate 2019-nCoV, which was declared to be the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans, different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. The nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples from all 4 patients were 2019-nCoV positive in our study, indicating that 2019-nCoV can infect the upper respiratory tract. According to the National Health Commission\u2019s guideline for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCov, isolation and in vitro cultures showed that 2019-nCov can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 hours [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. These results support the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is more infectious than MERSCoV and SARS-CoV, as it is easily discharged through the respiratory tract.",
            "The infectivity during the incubation period for 2019-nCoV is a big challenge for controlling the disease, especially with the new considerations for the possible infectious sources and the recognition and isolation of close contacts. Here are our recommendations. First, the epidemiological exposure history should be taken as the most important reference for judging the potential source of infection, and isolation and protection measures should be further strengthened for the relevant persons with clear risk factors for exposure history. Second, the determination of close contacts should also include those who are exposed to case patients during their incubation. Third, research into and development of a high-sensitivity rapid diagnostic reagent for 2019-nCoV should be accelerated, to facilitate the screening of infected persons among clinical and close contacts. Fourth, health education should be further strengthened, and protective equipment should be properly used to reduce the exposure to 2019-nCoV. Finally, if possible, the isolation and medical observation of close contacts should be centralized under the premise of the safely transport, such as masks, single-person transfer and transport vehicle disinfection, et al It is important to establish a community supervision mechanism when home isolation and observation are needed."

        "Introduction": [
            "In December 2019, a series of viral pneumonia cases of an unknown cause appeared in Wuhan, Hubei, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].",
            "As of 12 February 2020, a total of 59 804 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been detected in China, in 31 provinces, municipalities, and special administrative regions.",
            "Cases of 2019-nCoV are no longer limited to mainland China; at this writing, infections have been reported in 24 countries, including Singapore, the Republic of Korea, and Japan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].",
            "The first clinical data from 41 individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan, China, have been published."
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "On 21 January 2020, 2 patients from the same family unit were taken to hospital A in Shanghai with fever, respiratory symptoms, and pulmonary infiltrates on their chest radiographs.",
            "The investigators from the local center immediately conducted a face-to-face epidemiological survey for patients 1 and 2, and they collected clinical and laboratory data, including results of hematological, radiological, and respiratory pathogen examinations.",
            "All laboratory procedures for the clinical samples have been reported elsewhere [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",
            "Plasma was separated using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid bottles, and serum using clotted blood bottles"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "There were 4 patients in the study from 1 family unit. The authors numbered the cases from 1 to 4 according to the order of illness onset.",
            "Patient 1, an 88-year-old man, was incapacitated, and had hypertension, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
            "He lived in Shanghai year-round, with only his wife, patient.",
            "He had not left home for at least 2 weeks before illness onset, and had no contact with any other people except patients 2, 3, and 4.",
            "The Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples were 2019-nCoV positive for patients 1 and 2 on 22 January and for patients 3 and 4 on 24 January 2020, according to the 2019nCoV nucleic acid tests"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "In this familial cluster of 2019-nCoV infection, 4 patients were tested and confirmed as 2019-nCoV positive, according to nucleic acid detection.",
            "It is worth noting that patient 1 was an 88-year-old man with limited mobility.",
            "He had not left his apartment for at least 2 weeks before onset of his illness.",
            "The initial infection sources in patient 1 were most likely patient 2 or 3 during their incubation period, it is possible that patient 4 was infected by patient 2 or 3 and infected patient 1 during her incubation period.",
            "The findings indicate that a person with 2019-nCoV might be infectious during the incubation period"
