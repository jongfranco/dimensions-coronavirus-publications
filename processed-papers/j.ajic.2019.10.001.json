            "Although familial involvement during inpatient care is not uncommon in western countries, the types of caring activities that family members in Asian countries provide are significantly different. These activities may place the family member at risk from a health care\u2212associated infection. This study aimed to examine whether the role of patients\u2019 families has been accounted for in the infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines and policy, using examples from Bangladesh (low-income country), Indonesia (middleincome country), and South Korea (high-income country). Methods: The World Health Organization website and Institutional Repository for Information Sharing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, Australian Government Web Archive, Open Grey, Grey Matters, World Bank, and advanced Google search, as well as the Health Department/Ministry of Health websites for each target country and 4 western countries (Australia, Canada, England, and the United States) were searched. Other databases, such as Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, ProQuest databases, Google scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were also searched. This was to review the reflection of the cultural influence in IPC policies/guidelines by reviewing those from the global organizations, which are often used as a blueprint for policy development, as well as those from western countries, which hold different cultures in care arrangement. Search was conducted with attention to the key areas: definition and role of carer in the acute health care facility, involvement of patients/family members in IPC activities, patient and family member hand hygiene, and IPC education. Results: Ninety-two articles were identified based on the criteria for the study. Only 6 acknowledged that care is provided to hospitalized patients by their family members, and only 1 recommended that family members receive the same level of training as health care workers on IPC precautions. Other guides recommended the provision of information on IPC measures as means of patient involvement in the IPC program. Recognition of family caregivers or inclusion of them in the IPC strategies was not included in the target countries\u2019 guidelines. Conclusions: Although health care workers are the primary actors when it comes to providing care in acute health care settings, it is important to expand the IPC guides by considering the role of other caregivers. Policies and guidelines should reflect the cultural influence over healthcare. This is especially true when cultural values strongly influence over healthcare arrangements and the healthcare accommodates these cultural influences in the practice. Further work needs to be undertaken on the level of training/education provided to family members in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and South Korea. \u00a9 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

            "Caring for a sick family member in a hospital may indicate different care activities between Asian and western countries. Types of direct care activities that family members provide to their patients in acute care facility in Asian countries are similar to those provided by HCWs in western countries. Despite having some level of involvement in patient care, of the 92 documents found only 645,48,56,77,115,124 acknowledged the care provided to hospitalized patients by family members in acute care facilities. None of the policies and guidelines from the selected focus countries noted the care provision by family members and/or private carers, and none of them promoted the involvement of family members and/or private carers in the IPC precautions. Only one[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>] that was from the IPC guidance during the MERS outbreak in Korea stated the need for the same level of training on IPC measures for family members as HCWs in the event of care being provided to patients by family members.

        "conclusions": [
            "IPC guidelines and policies are found to be quite similar regardless of cultural differences in countries. It may be because many countries have developed their guidelines and policies with reference to the large public organizations, such as the WHO and CDC. However, when cultural values strongly influence the ways of care being delivered and the health care accommodates these cultural influences in the practice, policy and guidelines should reflect this difference. From the review, significant gaps were identified between actual practices and guidelines in the 3 selected Asian countries. Although they followed the evidence-based practice developed by global organizations, adaptation without consideration of cultural influences in health care may lead to adverse outcomes in health, that is, HAI. Findings from this review highlight the importance of developing in-depth understanding of cultural influence in health care delivery in which cultural values and belief are different from other parts of the world. Currently, limited guidelines are available in the HAI in these countries, and major gaps were identified between actual practice and guidelines. We acknowledge that our findings could not be representative of the entire Asian countries. We had to use a convenience sampling method due to limited access to obtain policies and guidelines that can only be retrieved from personal contacts. Further studies should be followed to explore guidelines and policies available in countries that share a similar culture."

            "Although emotional support accounts for most familial involvement in the western health care setting, more physical assistance with daily living activities are the common norm in Asian countries. Research undertaken with family caregivers in Bangladesh by Islam et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] highlighted constant physical contacts between family members and patients, their surrounding environment, as well as with other patients and carers in the same space. They identified that the patients\u2019 families are responsible for: feeding (including through a nasogastric tube), administering medications, cleaning the patient, making beds, repositioning, taking swabs, giving oxygen and urinary catheter care, etc. Similar involvement of patients\u2019 family caregivers in the direct care has also been reported from Vietnam,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Korea,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] India,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Indonesia,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] and China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] The concern here is that these patient care activities are no different from the care activities that are associated with the contamination of health care workers (HCW) hands during the patient care.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] Given the types of activities that patients\u2019 families are involved with and the length of time that they are present in the hospital wards, it could be theorized that these persons are at increased risk of health care\u2212associated infection (HAI), and may also be responsible for contributing to the spread. While there has been very little in the way of research on this issue, one study reporting the causes of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Korea[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] indicated that family members of patients were responsible for some patient care and this was reported as one of the contributing factors of the wide spread of MERS outbreak in 2015.",

Given the types of activities family members may be involved with and the length of time they may spend in the hospital, there may be a need to review these guidelines. Of concern also is the fact that from the few studies conducted, it appears that the knowledge about HAI and IPC strategies such as hand hygiene among family members of patients is limited.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]",

Articles in Bangladeshi, Indonesian, or Korean were not available on the IRIS. Available languages given in the IRIS were Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, German, and Portuguese. As for the CDC guidelines, the \u201cGuideline Library\u201d from the CDC website was used to locate relevant guidelines. Second, policies and guidelines from 4 western countries (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia) were searched so that comparisons could be made with the 3 target countries. A grey literature search was undertaken over 2 months, November and December 2018, using the Australian Government Web Archive, Open Grey, Grey Matters, World Bank, and advanced Google search. A specific search of the Health Department/Ministry of Health websites for each target country was also conducted between December 2018 and January 2019. Third, key personal contacts in each of the target countries were consulted to ensure that nothing was missed in our search. Key personal contacts in selected countries includes currently practicing health care professionals in acute care facilities, an IPC professional, and a senior researcher in the IPC field. Google translator was also used to translate the documents. The translated documents were then reviewed for accuracy by the key personal contacts in the selected countries, as well as by 2 of the authors who are native in Korean and Indonesian, respectively. The first author was responsible for the search, translation, and reviewing policies in Korean. Finally, using the same search terms that were adopted for the grey literature search (outlined later), a key word search was undertaken using databases related to the field of public health, health policy, communicable diseases, health care, nursing and allied health, and social science: Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Global Health, Proquest databases, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus to look for relevant recommendations and information regarding family caregivers\u2019 involvement in the IPC strategies in the published peer review journals.",

Although patient information for hospital admission is available from some Korean hospitals, active participation in the form of asking HCWs about hand hygiene or by performing hand hygiene is not included.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c123\" href=\"#r123\">123</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c128\" href=\"#r128\">128</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c129\" href=\"#r129\">129</a>] In contrast, patient empowerment in hand hygiene is clearly described in the patient information from the United States[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>] Canada,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c100\" href=\"#r100\">100</a>] and United Kingdom.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c114\" href=\"#r114\">114</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c115\" href=\"#r115\">115</a>] The information regarding HAI guides patients to be assertive in asking HCWs and visitors to clean their hands, as well as patients\u2019 own hand hygiene.",

However, there is no mention made about the roles of family members or privately hired carers who are primarily responsible for bedside care for patients in the acute care facility while staying with patients or inclusion of them in the IPC program. Therefore, the HCWs remain the target population for the IPC program, leaving the family caregiver under the radar.",

            "The level of inclusion of family caregivers in the IPC program varies across guidelines. The recommendation from the WHO51 suggests the same level of training of family caregivers on IPC strategies in the setting where the care provision is done by family members. Other guidelines from the WHO48,56 and CDC77 advise there should be tailored IPC training for caregivers based on the care activities they perform in the health care. These guidelines also acknowledged the care provision by family caregivers. Provision of information on HAI or hand hygiene to family caregivers are proposed as a means of patient involvement in the IPC program in other guidelines,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c115\" href=\"#r115\">115</a>] stating family caregivers in the guidelines. Although the provision of information on hand hygiene to patients and their family members was briefly mentioned in the guideline from 1 of target countries, tailored IPC strategy that was recommended by the WHO and CDC earlier for the family caregivers could not be found.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]",
            "In terms of sources of HAI risks from outside hospital, a search was conducted to review whether guidelines were available for items brought into hospitals by family members or visitors. Information could not be located in the IPC guidelines, but most hospital websites have patient information for admission containing information about what to bring and what not to bring to the hospital. For example, soap, towel, slippers, toothpaste, tooth brush, and a blanket for carers were advised to bring for admission in Korean hospitals,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c124\" href=\"#r124\">124</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c128\" href=\"#r128\">128</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c130\" href=\"#r130\">130</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c131\" href=\"#r131\">131</a>] and similar information was found in Bangladesh hospitals. It is stated that 1 carer can stay with a patient, but that the number of visitors at a time is limited in both countries. No policies or guidelines could be located stating patient family members staying with patients during admission. Other items from outside of hospital was food. Most western countries have similar guidelines on the food brought into the hospital in relation to food poisoning.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c104\" href=\"#r104\">104</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c112\" href=\"#r112\">112</a>], Although guidelines about food brought into the hospital could not be found for Bangladesh, most Bangladeshi hospitals have information about outside food brought into the hospital. However, no information regarding a food restriction policy from home to the hospital was found in Korean and Indonesian hospitals."
        ],
        "DISCUSSION": [
            "Caring for a sick family member in a hospital may indicate different care activities between Asian and western countries. Types of direct care activities that family members provide to their patients in acute care facility in Asian countries are similar to those provided by HCWs in western countries. Despite having some level of involvement in patient care, of the 92 documents found only 645,48,56,77,115,124 acknowledged the care provided to hospitalized patients by family members in acute care facilities. None of the policies and guidelines from the selected focus countries noted the care provision by family members and/or private carers, and none of them promoted the involvement of family members and/or private carers in the IPC precautions. Only one[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>] that was from the IPC guidance during the MERS outbreak in Korea stated the need for the same level of training on IPC measures for family members as HCWs in the event of care being provided to patients by family members. Most recommendations for patients and their families\u2019 involvement in the IPC strategies were through the provision of information on IPC.",
            "General IPC or HAI guidelines or policies from the target countries were limited, whereas disease-specific infection control guidelines are available, for example, tuberculosis, dengue, chikungunya, or MERS. It was clearly outlined in the Korean guideline that there had not been any national guidelines about HAI prior to the MERS outbreak.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] Because the importance of including patients\u2019 families in IPC measures was addressed in the WHO recommendation in the response to MERS, we reviewed the newly developed guideline from Korea with attention to the role of family members in the care and IPC program. Despite the emphasis on the HAI risks of family members and private carers during MERS outbreak,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c132\" href=\"#r132\">132</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c134\" href=\"#r134\">134</a>] neither the WHO recommendations nor the roles of family members or private carers who provide physical care to patients while staying next to patients were documented in the guideline. Without recognition of caring roles of family members and/or private carers in the guideline/ policy, family carers could not be included in the IPC strategies, posing a risk of HAI transmission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c135\" href=\"#r135\">135</a>]",
            "Since the recent episode of MERS in Korea, HAI risk associated with the involvement of patients\u2019 family members or private carers has been addressed in a number of studies, many of which suggest a need for health care system reform in relation to reducing the familial involvement in the inpatient care.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] In fact, an \u201cintegrated nursing and care service,\u201d which began as a pilot project in July 2013, has been converted into a health insurance business since MERS in 2015, and its legal basis was established by the new regulation on the integrated nursing and care service in the hospital setting revised in December 2015.132,134 There are 2 major changes noted with the new system.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c132\" href=\"#r132\">132</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c136\" href=\"#r136\">136</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c137\" href=\"#r137\">137</a>] First, family caregivers and privately hired carers are not to stay in the hospital for patients who meet the criteria for the new system: eligible patients and selected wards. This is to reduce the risk of overcrowding conditions in the patient room so that risk of HAI decreases accordingly. Therefore, nurses are to provide total care including assisting patient\u2019s activities of daily living, which were previously assisted by either family members of patients or private carers. However, owing to the combination of inadequate nursing staffing level and fundamental societal values operating within the society, total elimination of caregivers has not yet been achieved. Second, most hospitals including tertiary hospitals limit the number of carers to 1 person to stay with a patient, but still allow patients\u2019 carers to stay and assist with basic care. Therefore, the situation in relation to residing family carers remains the status quo.",
            "From this review, we found that the guidelines from Bangladesh,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c116\" href=\"#r116\">116</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c127\" href=\"#r127\">127</a>] Indonesia,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c118\" href=\"#r118\">118</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c119\" href=\"#r119\">119</a>] and South Korea[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c121\" href=\"#r121\">121</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c122\" href=\"#r122\">122</a>] were not culturally grounded in regard to IPC guidelines and policy in acute care facilities. In fact, the contents in the guidelines were very similar to those in the WHO, CDC, Canada, Australia, and United Kingdom, except that they lacked the references to the use of patient empowerment and engagement in hand hygiene. Cultural awareness or culturally competent health care were found in the guidelines from countries such as the United States[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c138\" href=\"#r138\">138</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c139\" href=\"#r139\">139</a>] and Australia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c140\" href=\"#r140\">140</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c141\" href=\"#r141\">141</a>] The WHO56 promotes the cultural consideration in the implementation strategies for hand hygiene. However, their recommendations seem to be formulated based on the assumption that the basic patient care is provided by HCWs in the hospital setting. Therefore, the focus of cultural consideration in the guidelines is about handwashing practices among HCWs rather than cultural influence over health care arrangements for various carers. It is important to consider direct patient care involvement of various carers as much as HCWs, patient room arrangement accommodating the alternate carers to stay and care for patients, and customs or culture that may influence the perception toward hand hygiene among the public, except HCWs. Alternate arrangement of care provision other than by HCWs are not considered in this guideline, but it was noted in 6 documents[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c115\" href=\"#r115\">115</a>] out of 92 listed. None of the guidelines used in the target countries point out the cultural consideration to the care involvement of family members.",
            "There are significant gaps between description of care activities performed by patient carers in the guidelines and findings from research studies. Although high nurse-to-patient ratio and various arrangements for carers to stay in the hospital, such as a spare mattress and hospital rules, could be enough evidence of these familial carers\u2019 involvement in the inpatient care, these involvements in care are not documented in the policies or guidelines. Uncertainty in care responsibility of patient carers because of the absence of role clarity may lead to supervision and education issues. Furthermore, it may have negative implications to patient safety. Besides patient empowerment and patient engagement in the hand hygiene program, guidelines about items brought into the hospitals by patient family members or visitors are absent from Korea and Indonesia. When reviewing patient information from western countries, patients and their family members are described as a 2-separate group. For example, patients are advised to ask their family or visitors to wash their hands every time they enter the room. However, in the patient information from Korean hospitals, patients and their carers are not separately described. Patients and their family members are treated as a group, so asking questions to wash hands between them may be considered an unnecessary procedure. In fact, there is no information stating patients to ask their visitors or family carers to wash hands in the documents from the target countries. More allowance of items brought into the hospital, such as blankets for cares and food, could be understood from this perspective."
        ],
        "CONCLUSIONS": [
            "IPC guidelines and policies are found to be quite similar regardless of cultural differences in countries. It may be because many countries have developed their guidelines and policies with reference to the large public organizations, such as the WHO and CDC. However, when cultural values strongly influence the ways of care being delivered and the health care accommodates these cultural influences in the practice, policy and guidelines should reflect this difference. From the review, significant gaps were identified between actual practices and guidelines in the 3 selected Asian countries. Although they followed the evidence-based practice developed by global organizations, adaptation without consideration of cultural influences in health care may lead to adverse outcomes in health, that is, HAI. Findings from this review highlight the importance of developing in-depth understanding of cultural influence in health care delivery in which cultural values and belief are different from other parts of the world. Currently, limited guidelines are available in the HAI in these countries, and major gaps were identified between actual practice and guidelines. We acknowledge that our findings could not be representative of the entire Asian countries. We had to use a convenience sampling method due to limited access to obtain policies and guidelines that can only be retrieved from personal contacts. Further studies should be followed to explore guidelines and policies available in countries that share a similar culture."
