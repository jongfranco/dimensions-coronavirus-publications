        "abstract": "Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\nMethods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.",

The survival term of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1\u20132 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain to hospital critical care resources, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced."

The mean age of the 52 patients was 59\u00b77 (SD 13\u00b73) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61\u00b75%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3\u201311) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64\u00b76 years [11\u00b72] vs 51\u00b79 years [12\u00b79]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13\u00b75%) patients.<br/><br/>Interpretation The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1\u20132 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced."

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases. Previous studies have only described the general epidemiological findings, clinical presentation, and clinical outcomes of patients of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] However, specific information characterising critically ill patients remains unknown. The data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are scarce, but are of paramount importance to reduce mortality. In this study, we investigated critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital. The baseline SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality data from this study will be of considerable value for the early identification of individuals who are at risk of becoming critically ill and who are most likely to benefit from intensive care treatment."

Due to the exploratory nature of the study, which was not driven by formal hypotheses, the sample size calculation was waived. Instead, we hope that the findings presented here will encourage a larger cohort study or potentially some randomly controlled trials. Second, some specific information from the ICU was missing, such as mechanical ventilation settings. The data on radiographical examination, supportive treatment, living status, and the duration from ICU admission to death, however, are indisputable. Third, this is a retrospective study. The data in this study permit a preliminary assessment of the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Further studies are still needed."

In the cohort, lymphocytopenia occurred in 44 (85%) patients, with no significant difference between the two groups. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to develop ARDS, and to receive mechanical ventilation, either invasively or noninvasively."

            "We report on 52 critically ill patients with con\u00adfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterised by severe hypo\u00ad xaemia. 32 (61\u00b75%) of critically ill patients had died at 28 days. Of all included patients, 37 (71%) required mechanical ventilation and 35 (67%) had ARDS.",
            "Since no specialised medication to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified at this time, the mainstay of treatment has been supportive care. Patients are being treated in isolation, and their close contacts are being quarantined. For non-critically ill patients, close followup is likely to be sufficient to manage the disease.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] For critically ill patients, however, aggressive treatments and intensive care are needed. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterise critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. In three previously published studies of crtically ill patients, the patient numbers were too small to summarise the characteristics and mortality of these patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]",
            "Like SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans, and these viruses are all related to high mortality in critically ill patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] However, the mortality rate in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort is higher than that previously seen in critically ill patients with SARS. In a cohort of 38 critically ill patients with SARS from 13 hospitals in Canada, 29 (76%) patients required mechanical ventilation, 13 (43%) patients had died at 28 days, and six (16%) patients remained on mechanical ventilation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] (38%) of 45 patients and 14 (26%) of 54 patients who were critically ill with SARS infection were also reported to have died at 28 days in a Singapore cohort[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] and a Hong Kong cohort,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] respectively. The mortality rate in our cohort is likely to be higher than that seen in critically ill patients with MERS infection. In a cohort of 12 patients with MERS from two hospitals in Saudi Arabia, seven (58%) patients had died at 90 days.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Since the follow-up time is shorter in our cohort, we postulate that the mortality rate would be higher after 28 days than that seen in patients with MERS-CoV.",
            "The fundamental pathophysiology of severe viral pneumonia is severe ARDS. Men and people of an older age (>65 years) are more likely to develop ARDS than women or those of a younger age.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] Therefore, it is",
            "reasonable that the mortality at 28 days of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is similar to the mortality of severe ARDS, which is near 50%.17 With a substantial increase in the number of critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, more provisional ICUs are being established in Wuhan, China. Qualified specialists are coming to Wuhan from other provinces of China and are currently working in these provisional ICUs, fever clinics, and newly constructed hospitals.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] As the clinical capacity to treat patients improves, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is expected to decrease.",
            "As mentioned in previous studies, nearly 70% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 were men.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] The patients are older in our study than in previous studies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] We observed that non-survivors were older than survivors. Based on previous studies, evidence suggests that older, male patients are the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] which is supported by our data. As previously reported, patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease are at increased risk of becoming critically ill or dying if they have SARS-CoV-2 infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]",
            "In our cohort, fever is the most common symptom in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, which is in accordance with previous studies, but not all patients had fever.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] We also found that fever was not detected at the onset of illness in six (11\u00b75%), and that it was in fact detected 2\u20138 days later. The delay of fever manifestation hinders early identification of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2\u2014if patients are asymptomatic identification of suspected cases is more difficult.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] The median duration from onset of symptoms to radiological confirmation of pneumonia was 5 (3\u20137) days, meaning that early or repeated radiological examinations are useful in screening patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]",
            "As for laboratory tests, lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 80% of critically ill patients in our cohort. Lymphocytopenia is a prominent feature of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV infection because targeted www.thelancet.com/respiratory Published online February 21, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5",
            "invasion by SARS-CoV viral particles damages the cytoplasmic component of the lymphocyte and causes its destruction.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] Additionally, lymphocytopenia is also common in the critically ill patients with MERS infection, which is the result of apoptosis of lymphocytes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Therefore, we postulate that necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocytes also induces lymphocytopenia in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a previous study, mainly in non-critical patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, 35% of patients had only mild lymphocytopenia,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] suggest\u00ad ing that the severity of lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "Mechanical ventilation is the main supportive treatment for critically ill patients. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was lower in our patients than in patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] The substantial difference in PaO2/FiO2 ratio between survivors and non-survivors in our study, indicates this ratio is associated with the severity of illness and thus prognosis. Barotrauma seems less severe in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are being mechanically ventilated than that seen in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV. In our study, barotrauma occurred in only one (2%) patient, who had been hospitalised for nearly 1 month, and he is currently on a ventilator and receiving ECMO. In patients with SARS, barotrauma occurred in about 25% of patients on mechanical ventilation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] The lower occurrence of barotrauma in our cohort is probably related to the widely accepted strategy of protective ventilation in mainland China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] At the same time, prone position and ECMO have been used to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.",
            "Without solid evidence, nearly half of the patients were given antiviral agents, and more than half were given intravenous glucocorticoids. Patients treated with lopinavir were from an ongoing clinical trial registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029308). Remdesivir was given to the first patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Trials on remdesivir are about to recruit both mild to moderate patients (NCT04252664) and severe patients (NCT04257656) infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although, intravenous glucocorticoids were commonly used in patients with severe SARS or MERS pneumonia, their efficacy remains controversial and their use to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is also controversial.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04244591) might shed some light on the safety and efficacy of these drugs as treatment.",
            "This study has several limitations. First, only 52 critically ill patients were included. However, the population from which they were sampled was much larger than that of the three studies previously published.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] We included all the critically ill patients being cared for in the ICU of Jin Yin-tan hospital who met the inclusion criteria. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, which was not driven by formal hypotheses, the sample size calculation was waived. Instead, we hope that the findings presented here will encourage a larger cohort study or potentially some randomly controlled trials. Second, some specific information from the ICU was missing, such as mechanical ventilation settings. The data on radiographical examination, supportive treatment, living status, and the duration from ICU admission to death, however, are indisputable. Third, this is a retrospective study. The data in this study permit a preliminary assessment of the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Further studies are still needed.",
            "In conclusion, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is high. The survival term of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1\u20132 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain to hospital critical care resources, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.",
