        "abstract": "A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) causing acute illness with severe symptoms has been isolated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Since its emergence, cases have been found worldwide, reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks over the past 2 decades. Current understanding of this epidemic remains limited due to its rapid development and available data. While occurrence outside mainland China remains low, the likelihood of increasing cases globally continues to rise. Given this potential, it is imperative that emergency clinicians understand the preliminary data behind the dynamics of this disease, recognize possible presentations of patients, and understand proposed treatment modalities.",

The remaining identified human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) are limited in their severity of disease and often fail to produce symptoms greater than the common cold in immunocompetent hosts.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]"

            "Comparisons of the current COVID-19 outbreak are being made to 2 recently emerged coronaviruses from zoonotic spillover events; SARSCoV (2002\u20132004, originating from Guangdong Province, China) and the multiple MERS-CoV outbreaks over the period (2012\u20132016, originating from Saudi Arabia). Further, all 3 pathogenic coronavirus syndromes seem to present with similar symptoms of cough, fever, and pneumonia. The current COVID-19 outbreak has eclipsed both the 2002 SARS outbreak and the 2012\u20132016 MERS outbreak in number of cases and is closing in on a similar death toll; however, both SARS and MERS appear to have had higher case-fatality rates (Table 1) and worse severity of illness.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] In comparison to seasonal influenza globally, coronaviruses represent a smaller burden of disease, and fall well short of the 1918 Influenza pandemic (Table 1)."

            "Multiple reports have confirmed human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19.8 When person-to-person spread has occurred with MERSCoV and SARS-CoV, it is thought to have happened mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how Influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. Inoculation via \u201cfomite-to-face\u201d contact is also likely a significant contributor to the spread of the virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Recently, the first case of asymptomatic transmission was reported, though the theory remains unproven.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] This development raises concerns that the COVID-19 may be similar to other viruses such as chickenpox and measles in that transmission may be possible during the incubation period or by patients with mild disease."

Currently, a case fatality rate (CFR) of slightly >3% has been reported, with some reports as high as 5%.9,10 For comparison, MERS and SARS exhibited CFRs of 35% and 15%, respectively.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Mortality among COVID-19 victims seems highest for the elderly and those with multiple comorbidities."

Less common symptoms included myalgias (11%), rhinorrhea (10%), headache (8%), chest pain (2%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (3%).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] The vast majority of patients presented with >1 symptom.

Approximately one third of patients had complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal injury, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia, but it is unclear whether these cases were initial presentations or later stage disease.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] Approximately 23%\u201332% of patients were admitted to the ICU, primarily for increased oxygen support.

            "Because the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral respiratory syndromes, health care professionals must obtain a detailed travel history in any patient presenting to the emergency department with fever and respiratory symptoms (Figure 2). Any patient with flu-like symptoms and travel to China or close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19 in the past 14 days should be considered a patient under investigation (PUI).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] A close contact is anyone within 6 feet of a confirmed COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time.

Medium risk exposures include those traveling in China but outside of Hubei province without high risk exposures and household members using consistently proper home care and isolation precautions. Low risk exposures include being in the same indoor environment such as a waiting room for a prolonged period with a confirmed COVID-19 case but not meeting the definition of close contact. No risk is identifiable for those who are in brief passing of a patient with confirmed COVID-19.",
            "Diagnosis of COVID-19 is performed via molecular assays of respiratory specimens at WHO-designated regional referral laboratories.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] On February 7, the CDC began the distribution of test kits for regional testing. More widely available testing is anticipated to be available soon. For institutions where testing is unavailable, testing by the CDC remains the only option. Confirmation of another viral respiratory illness in a PUI should not delay COVID-19 testing. The decision to remove a patient from PUI status should be made after full clinical evaluation and consultation with public health authorities."
        ],
        "4.3 Prevention": [
            "Currently, the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 are poorly understood. Infection prevention guidance or COVID-19 is based upon guidance previously developed for MERS and SARS as well as interim guidelines provided by the WHO and CDC.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]",
            "In health care settings, triage and out-of-hospital protocols should identify a PUI before or upon ED arrival to minimize exposure to other patients and providers. Measures should include screening questions (including travel history) and respiratory and hand hygiene. After identifying a PUI, both hospital infection control and the local health department should be contacted immediately to prevent further spread amongst patients and health care workers. Any PUI should be given a surgical mask and placed in a private room or negative pressure room if available.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]",
            "Like MERS and SARS, it is assumed the COVID-19 can be spread by the airborne route. Surgical face masks may be helpful for larger fluid droplets associated with coughing and sneezing, but they are unlikely to help with small airborne contaminants.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Where available, respirators with an adequate seal and air movement directed through filters should be more effective.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] The proper usage of respirators and other personal protective equipment (PPE) including donning, fit, and frequent changing combined with proper hand hygiene represent the most effective method of preventing transmission in health care settings.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]",
            "If a patient needs to be hospitalized and an airborne infection isolation room is not available, the patient should be transferred to a facility with appropriate capabilities. Isolation rooms and care processes should be configured to minimize the number of health care personnel exposed to the patient as well as the duration of contact. It is paramount that all health care professionals use standard, contact, droplet, and airborne precautions in addition to an eye shield. PPE is especially important during aerosol-generating procedures (eg, intubation) when transmission is likely increased.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] After a patient vacates the room, it is unknown how long COVID-19 says airborne. Entrance to the vacated room requires respiratory protection for a period that is specific to the ventilation and clearance rates for the room."
        ],
        "4.4 Disposition": [
            "Not all COVID-19 exposed or afflicted patients will need hospital admission. However, the decision to discharge a PUI for home isolation should be made in consultation with the local public health authorities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] Patients should be directed to use appropriate hand hygiene, wear a simple facemask when around others, and remain isolated to a single room in the house whenever possible.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] Patients should only leave the house for medical attention after calling in advance to inform the medical office of their COVID-19 PUI status.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] Although patients with mild symptoms can be discharged, there are reports of clinical decline in the second week of illness with over 50% of patients having dyspnea around day 8.31 Therefore, discharge may be inappropriate for patients who are unable to adhere to recommendations, return precautions, self-monitoring, or those with inadequate housing. Patients with evidence of severe illness (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, or other signs of shock) or those with comorbidities (older age, immunocompromised, chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular, or chronic lung disease) will require admission to isolation units and/or the ICU.",
            "The WHO has published comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines for caring for patients with severe acute respiratory infections thought to be related to COVID-19.20,32 The mainstay of treatment for suspected COVID-19 infections is supportive care. In patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, viral testing should be initiated early for disease confirmation and symptomatic treatment initiated as needed. Intravenous fluids should be used judiciously in patients without overt signs of fluid depletion as they may worsen oxygenation with increasing disease severity. In patients presenting with severe respiratory symptoms with radiographic findings, broad spectrum antibiotics should be administered early, since it is often not possible to differentiate between bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19 infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] As with MERS and SARS, steroids should be avoided.",
            "Beyond supportive care, there are no proven alternative treatments for coronavirus infections, although several potential therapies have been suggested and tested in limited settings. Data from both the SARS and MERS epidemics have demonstrated worse long-term outcomes with the use of corticosteroids, and the use of steroids should only be reserved for patients requiring treatment for other disease processes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]",
            "While currently not supported by the CDC or WHO guidelines, retrospective studies of the use of the protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir during the SARS outbreak demonstrated improved survival when compared to case-matched patients receiving standard therapy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] Ribavirin, however, resulted in worse SARS outcomes when compared to case-matched control patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] In contrast, based upon limited data, Ribavirin seems to be associated with improved MERS survival.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] Similar randomized trials evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir for MERS have been designed, but are not yet completed. Current reports confirm that the Chinese Health Ministry is treating COVID-19 infected patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, but there are no data on the outcomes."
        ],
        "5 CONCLUSION": [
            "The WHO has declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Currently, other seasonal infections cause more global disease than COVID-19. However, there are concerning elements to this emerging infectious agent, including a greater R0, initial greater estimated mortality, and no inherent immunity in global populations. Though data remains limited, it is imperative that emergency clinicians understand the dynamics of this emerging epidemic at both the individual- and population-based levels, learn how to recognize those patients at risk or suffering from COVID-19, and prepare to treat these patients in their clinical practice."
