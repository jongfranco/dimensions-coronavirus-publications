        "abstract": "Background and Aim: Belonging to the Coronaviridae family, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes respiratory, reproductive, and renal diseases in poultry. Preventative measures lie mainly in vaccination, while the gold standard for IBV classification and differentiation is based on the sequence analysis of the spike 1 (S1) gene. In this study, we tested a new assay for IBV strain classification that is less expensive and requires reduced time and effort to perform. We carried out a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction followed by high-resolution melting (qRT-PCR/HRM) curve analysis.\n\nMaterials and Methods: In this study, qRT-PCR was conducted on a partial fragment S1 gene followed by a high resolution melting curve analysis (qRT-PCR/HRM) on 23 IBV-positive samples in Jordan. For this assay, we utilized the most common IBV vaccine strains (Mass and 4/91) as a reference in the HRM assay. To evaluate the discrimination power of the qRT-PCR/ HRM, we did the sequencing of the partial S1 gene.\n\nResults: It was shown that HRM was able to classify IBV samples into four clusters based on the degree of similarity between their melting points: The first cluster exhibited the highest similarity to the 4/91 strain, while the second was similar to the Mass-related IBV strain. Although the third cluster contained the highest number of samples, it displayed no similarity to any of the reference vaccine strains, and, after comparing them with the sequencing results, we found that the samples in the third cluster were similar to the variant II-like (IS-1494-06) IBV field strain. Finally, the fourth cluster comprised one unique sample that was found to belong to the Q1 IBV strain.\n\nConclusion: Our developed qRT-PCR/HRM curve analysis was able to detect and rapidly identify novel and vaccine-related IBV strains as confirmed by S1 gene nucleotide sequences, making it a rapid and cost-effective tool.",

            "The clusters are produced by the ScreenClust software into four clusters with the typicality and probability of each sample to be in one of the four clusters (Figure-1). Furthermore, the HRM GCPs of selected samples are shown in Figure-2. The sequencing of the partial S1 gene was carried out to confirm the results of the HRM assay (Figure-3). The sequencing of the partial S1 gene for all five IBV vaccine strains matched 100% with their identity. Out of the 22 field samples, three samples were found to be IBV 4/91like strain on sequencing and on HRM analysis. Out of the 22 field samples, seven samples were confirmed with sequencing and HRM analysis to be of Masslike strain. Eleven IBV field samples were found to be of IBV variant II-like (IS-1494-06) field strain (on HRM, 8/11 were also of variant II-like and 3/11 were of Mass like) and one field sample was a unique IBV strain (Q1 strain). The HRM assay divided the IBV vaccine and field strains into four different clusters.",
            "The first cluster consisted of the IBV 4/91 and IBV 4/91-like strains. Three vaccines and three field isolates were located in this cluster. The IBV strain 4/91 can be found both as a vaccine and as a field strain and many IBV infections in different countries have been linked to 4/91 field strains. The IBV field samples (D10117, 101216D, and 7P6) belonged to cluster 1, representing the 4/91 and IBV 4/91-like strains, respectively. Based on HRM analysis, the melting temperature of the 101216D sample (78.30\u00b0C) was close to that of the 4V (1/96) strain (78.09\u00b0C), while the melting temperatures of the 7P6 sample (77.49\u00b0C) and the 3V (CR88 variant) strain (77.09\u00b0C) were similarly close. Despite the variation in melting temperatures between the vaccine and field strains in cluster 1, HRM and ScreenClust analysis were still able to identify the similarities between them by classifying them into the same cluster.",
            "The second cluster contained the IBV Mass and Mass-like strains. Two IBV vaccine strains were located in this cluster along with 10 field IBV isolates, three of which were found to be of a variant II-like (1S/1494/06-like) strains on sequencing (T2, 61216D and 0605P). While cluster 2, which includes IBV mass and mass like strains, has a closer range between the melting temperatures (78.24-78.51) with less variation up to 0.27. This indicates that the viruses of the field samples share close sequences to the Mass vaccine strain.",

            "Two softwares were used for the analysis of the HRM results. The operating HRM software installed on the Rotor-Gene Q 5plex machine and the RotorGene ScreenClust HRM software (Qiagen, CA, USA) was used to analyze the results of HRM and to assign the different IBV strains into clusters according to their HRM patterns. The HRM analysis using the operating software was done by setting a reference IBV genotype either as 4/91, Mass, or variant II genotypes, after normalizations, the HRM genotype confidence percentages (GCPs) were obtained. For the ScreenClust software, the unsupervised model was used and then data were normalized and clusters were generated to contain all IBV isolates. The typicality and probability of each sample was recorded.",
            "The S1 RT-PCR products of the nested RT-PCR amplification were treated with ExoSAP-IT PCR Product Cleanup Reagent (Cat. No: 78201, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 2 \u03bcl of ExoSAP enzyme were added to 5 \u03bcl of the product then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min to degrade remaining primers and nucleotides followed by another incubation at 80\u00b0C for 15 min to inactivate the ExoSAP-IT reagent. The cleaned RT-PCR products were sent to a sequencing facility (Macrogen, South Korea) to be sequenced by chain termination technology. S1 sequences were viewed on the BioEdit software and edited by the Edit Sequence interface of the Lasergene package. Sequence alignment, calculation of the sequence nucleotide similarities, and construction of the phylogenetic tree were done by the MegAlign interface of the Lasergene package. The partial sequences of S1 gene of all IBV isolates included in this study were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers; MK680008-MK6800034."

        "Discussion": [
            "HRM analysis has been used to detect and genotype fowl adenoviruses, avian influenza virus, and avian nephritis virus, among others [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. The first published study to use HRM analysis to the type of IBV strains was carried out in Australia, where an HRM assay that targeted the 3\u2019UTR gene was",
            "Figure-3: Phylogenetic tree analysis of the partial spike 1 gene sequences of IBV vaccine strains and field isolates. The solid circle is the IBV vaccine strains. The solid squares are the mismatched IBV (in HRM analysis, those isolates were clustered in cluster 2 (Mass-like type), but in sequencing, they were of IS/1494/06 like). The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. There were a total of 315 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6.",
            "performed on local IBV vaccine and field strains [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Of the 17 IBV-positive cases, only 12 were typed correctly with matching HRM/3\u2019UTR and S1 gene sequencing results [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. As can be seen, our HRM assay can type any Mass or 4/91 IBV vaccine and field strain correctly to their corresponding cluster. However, a problem is only encountered when dealing with IBV variant II field strain. In such cases, we might need to confirm the results of the HRM assay by sequencing of the S1 gene.",
            "Regarding cluster 3, the variant II-like (1S/1494/06-like) stain is an endemic IBV strain in Jordan that is involved in the respiratory, kidney, and reproductive tract problems [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Recently, the variant II-like (1S/1494/06-like) field strain has been found to be subject to multiple recombination events, which might explain the wide range in melting temperatures in cluster 3 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>].",
            "Concerning cluster 4, sample 072017 was found to belong to the unique Q1 strain, which was first reported in China, in 1996, and then in Italy during a 2011 outbreak in broilers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Even though the melting point for this sample is similar to those in other clusters, HRM and ScreenClust analysis were able to differentiate it into a separate cluster."
