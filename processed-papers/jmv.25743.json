As the outbreak of COVID-19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe. In this article, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID-19 based on the several open datasets on",

            "In conclusion, the dataset we have used for our experiment 2019 Coronavirus dataset (January - February 2020), COVID-19 (nCOV-19) Corona Virus Spread Dataset, and Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset can be useful to monitor the emerging outbreaks, such as 2019-nCoV. Such activities can help generate and disseminate detailed information to the scientific community, especially in the early stages of an outbreak when there is little else available, allowing for independent assessments of key parameters that influence interventions. We observe an interesting different case reported based on the different datasets of 2019-nCoV, which helps us to understand that it needs more epidemiological and serological studies. We also investigated early indications that the response is being strengthened in China and worldwide on the basis of a decrease in the case of detection time and rapid management of internationally identified travel-related cases. As a caveat, this is an early data analysis and visualization approach of a situation that is rapidly evolving. To best of our knowledge, this is the very first attempt on COVID-19 which focuses on the visual exploratory data analysis based on different data sources. However, knowledge about this novel SARS-CoV-2 virus remains limited among general people around the globe. Raw data released by various sources are not adequately capable to provide an informative understanding of COVID-19, caused of SARS CoV-2. Therefore, A user-friendly data visualization model will be more effective to understand the epidemic outbreak of this severe disease. Visualization model like Map view and Tree Map View provides an interactive interface and visualize each and every raw fact in a comprehensive manner. Hopefully, in the coming weeks, we will continue to monitor this outbreak's epidemiology data that we have used in this research and from other official sources."

            "Recent pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China has brought closely into our sight the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This new coronavirus, named 2019\u2010nCoV, belonging to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, distinct from MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV, was described in reference.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] The first case of an unexplained new pneumonia origin was detected on 12 December 2019 and was later determined by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a non-SARS novel coronavirus. The Coronaviridae family consists of a group of large, single, plus stranded RNA viruses isolated from multiple species, and it is known to cause the common cold and diarrheal diseases in humans.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] In the year of 2003, the SARS outbreak was associated with a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [ SARS\u2010CoV]).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] However, a number of cases of unknown cause of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, with clinical presentations closely resembling viral pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] A total of 1975 cases of pneumonia have been confirmed in China so far (according to the state council information office in Beijing, China's capital, January 26, 2020).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] Yet the virus has tended to spread out of China, since one case in Thailand, one case in Japan and two cases in Korea had been sequentially reported since 15 January 2020.7 Surprisingly, the transmission of animals to humans is considered the origin of epidemics, as in November many patients reported to have visited a local fish and wild animal market in Wuhan. Apart from this, recently, evidence has been gathered for the animal to the human and interhuman transmission of the virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] The situation is getting serious day by day and for further prevention and control, it is imperative that we have a better understanding of its pandemic nature. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern, following H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (2016) and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Meanwhile, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name for the epidemic disease caused by 2019-nCoV: coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Until 24 February 2020, 2019-nCoV has affected more than 79,331 patients in 29 countries/regions and has become a major global health concern. Based on the situational report-35 by World Health Organization (WHO), China has confirmed 77262 cases with 2595 deaths reported until 24 February 2020. However, rest of the world has confirmed 2069 cases (300 new cases) with 23 deaths reported so far. Till now, China reported 415 new confirmed cases, with 150 new deaths. In comparison, there were 300 new confirmed cases reported outside of China with the number of new deaths being 6 (https://www.who.int/docs/defaultsource/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200224-sitrep-35-covid19.pdf?sfvrsn=1ac4218d2). With regard to the virus itself, the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy has renamed 2019-nCoV as a severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. As the outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is expanding rapidly in China and beyond, threatening to become a global pandemic, epidemiological data needs to be analyzed in a way so that the exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods and visualization model will increase the situational awareness among the mass community in upcoming days. Health workers, governments and the public therefore need to cooperate globally to prevent its spread."

            "We used the open dataset of Novel Corona Virus 2019 provided by the Johns Hopkins University; they made an exceptional dashboard using the affected cases data to date.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Apart from this, they also provide an opportunity for data analyst and researcher by providing the data available in google sheets format. Therefore, daily level information on the affected people can provide some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community. This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths, and recovery on the cases of 2019 novel coronavirus. As this is a time-series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number. The data is available from 22 January 2020. Our research team believes that these epidemic data should be openly available and easily accessible for all health professionals and data scientists. This dataset would serve as a starting point for people to gather more data about epidemics, not just statistics, but also new stories, government responses and so on."

            "This research analyzed three different categories of data including confirmed, death and recovered cases inside china for a time period of 22 January to 16 February 2020. This will also provide a comparative analysis of all the cases reported inside and outside of China. However, we present different cases worldwide in order to comprehend the specific numbers of cases reported for a specific time period. After analyzing, there were 58182 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 16 February 2020. However, the highest number of deaths reported in China on 16 February 2020 was 1696. Surprisingly, there was a significant number of recovered cases reported till 16 February 2020 and it was around 6639 ( Figure 1)."

        "discussion": [
            "Another example of the importance of animal-human interface infections is the current outbreak of the COVID-19 disease. And the issues resulting from the advent of a newly identified organism as it spreads through individuals and across national and international frontiers. At the advent of an outbreak such as this, readily available data and information are equally important to begin the evaluation needed to understand the risks and start containment outbreak activities. Such information includes initial reports of countries with confirmed, death and recovered cases ratio, also, how the countries outside china are affecting, how the province of china are struggling to handle the situation of COVID-19 and more importantly ratio analysis of these real-world data, as well as information obtained from specific regions of globally from past outbreaks. Information and understanding of the consequences are needed to help refine the risk assessment as the outbreak continues and to ensure that patients are best managed. Much of this information emerges in real-time, challenges our understanding, yet refines our responses. The analysis presented here based on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visual exploratory data analysis (V-EDA) with the help of the dataset provided by John Hopkins University, World Health Organization (WHO), Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Health Commission (NHC), and DXY. However, we have preprocessed and cleaned the dataset information according to our needs. For storing and analyzing the data, we have used the python-based library of NumPy (https://numpy.org/) and pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org). Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org), Plotly (https://plot.ly), Seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org), and Folium were also used to visualize the highlighted data in an interactive manner. All the experiment with the dataset has been made by using the support of Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org) in a Linux based local machine platform by using Python Language in the Machine Learning research lab at the Dhaka International University (DIU). We report here each and every single detail of different cases of COVID-19 between 22 January 2020 to 16 February 2020. Currently, there is an obvious urgency to understand the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 viruses not only in China but also worldwide to aware of ourselves for upcoming days. Therefore, this is a minor initiative of analyzing real-world time series data and visualize them in such a manner so that peoples around the globe have better understandings of its severe nature. We are still observing the undesirable prevalence of this SARS-CoV-2 virus and to date 24 February 2020 the number of death cases reported was 2618 and among them, only 23 death cases reported outside China. This is extremely alarming not only to China but to the rest of the world as well. In this research, we have enlisted the most reported cases in China, outside China and in different provinces in China. We also analyzed the number of affected countries with reported confirmed, deaths and recovered cases. Apart from that, we designed Map view and Treemap's view with an appropriate number to analyze the epidemiological outbreak of the COVID-19."

Therefore, A user-friendly data visualization model will be more effective to understand the epidemic outbreak of this severe disease. Visualization model like Map view and Tree Map View provides an interactive interface and visualize each and every raw fact in a comprehensive manner. Hopefully, in the coming weeks, we will continue to monitor this outbreak's epidemiology data that we have used in this research and from other official sources."

        "1. Introduction": [
            "Recent pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China has brought closely into our sight the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This new coronavirus, named 2019\u2010nCoV, belonging to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, distinct from MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV, was described in reference.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] The first case of an unexplained new pneumonia origin was detected on 12 December 2019 and was later determined by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a non-SARS novel coronavirus. The Coronaviridae family consists of a group of large, single, plus stranded RNA viruses isolated from multiple species, and it is known to cause the common cold and diarrheal diseases in humans.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] In the year of 2003, the SARS outbreak was associated with a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [ SARS\u2010CoV]).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] However, a number of cases of unknown cause of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, with clinical presentations closely resembling viral pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] A total of 1975 cases of pneumonia have been confirmed in China so far (according to the state council information office in Beijing, China's capital, January 26, 2020).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] Yet the virus has tended to spread out of China, since one case in Thailand, one case in Japan and two cases in Korea had been sequentially reported since 15 January 2020.7 Surprisingly, the transmission of animals to humans is considered the origin of epidemics, as in November many patients reported to have visited a local fish and wild animal market in Wuhan. Apart from this, recently, evidence has been gathered for the animal to the human and interhuman transmission of the virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] The situation is getting serious day by day and for further prevention and control, it is imperative that we have a better understanding of its pandemic nature. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern, following H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola in West Africa (2014), Zika (2016) and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Meanwhile, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a new name for the epidemic disease caused by 2019-nCoV: coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Until 24 February 2020, 2019-nCoV has affected more than 79,331 patients in 29 countries/regions and has become a major global health concern. Based on the situational report-35 by World Health Organization (WHO), China has confirmed 77262 cases with 2595 deaths reported until 24 February 2020. However, rest of the world has confirmed 2069 cases (300 new cases) with 23 deaths reported so far. Till now, China reported 415 new confirmed cases, with 150 new deaths. In comparison, there were 300 new confirmed cases reported outside of China with the number of new deaths being 6 (https://www.who.int/docs/defaultsource/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200224-sitrep-35-covid19.pdf?sfvrsn=1ac4218d2). With regard to the virus itself, the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy has renamed 2019-nCoV as a severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. As the outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is expanding rapidly in China and beyond, threatening to become a global pandemic, epidemiological data needs to be analyzed in a way so that the exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods and visualization model will increase the situational awareness among the mass community in upcoming days. Health workers, governments and the public therefore need to cooperate globally to prevent its spread."

        "2. Material and Methods": [
            "We used the open dataset of Novel Corona Virus 2019 provided by the Johns Hopkins University; they made an exceptional dashboard using the affected cases data to date.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Apart from this, they also provide an opportunity for data analyst and researcher by providing the data available in google sheets format. Therefore, daily level information on the affected people can provide some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community. This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths, and recovery on the cases of 2019 novel coronavirus. As this is a time-series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number. The data is available from 22 January 2020. Our research team believes that these epidemic data should be openly available and easily accessible for all health professionals and data scientists. This dataset would serve as a starting point for people to gather more data about epidemics, not just statistics, but also new stories, government responses and so on."
        ],
        "2.1 Description of the Dataset from Different Sources": [
            "For this article, various sources of the dataset have been used for our analysis and visualizations. Mainly, we have used three different sources of dataset including 2019 Coronavirus dataset (January - February 2020) which tracks the spread of 2019-nCoV, COVID-19 (nCOV-19) Corona Virus Spread dataset which consist of number of confirmed, death and recovered reported and Novel Corona Virus 2019 dataset which handles the day level information on 2019-nCoV affected cases. Table 1 provides insight on each dataset and their respective data files with their column description. Moreover, we also developed Table 2 for providing the data analyst with a comprehensive knowledge of every column for the used dataset. We have enlisted each distinguished column from all three different sources of the dataset and assemble it according to their appearances in the dataset.",
            "We analyzed our datasets with different exploratory data analysis methods and visualize those data to provide a sufficient consciousness regarding the outbreak of COVID-19 all over the globe. Our exploit data performed with the 2019 Coronavirus dataset (January February 2020), COVID-19 (nCOV-19) Corona Virus Spread Dataset and Novel Corona",
            "Virus 2019 Datasets. Here we present an effort to visualize and analyze data between 22 January 2020 and 16 February 2020. However, a massive number of cases are reported in China compared to the rest of the world and interestingly the next few affected countries are the neighbors of China. Moreover, even in China most of the cases reported are from a particular province Hubei. It is no surprise because Hubei's capital is Wuhan, where the first cases are reported. Till now, COVID-19 propagated almost 29 countries worldwide and 31 states or provinces in China. Outside China, as expected, there was not much death due to COVID-19 recorded. Only Five deaths outside China are reported until 16 February 2020. There are however more cases of recovered than death and in comparison, with 1770 deaths, there were recovery cases of 10865 patients. We also provide a Map representation of different countries with confirmed cases and death reported respectively till 16 February 2020 based on their longitude and latitude. We have enlisted all 29 affected countries outside China and the number of confirmed cases of different Chinese provinces for providing a vibrant depiction of this intense SARS-CoV-2 (Table 3).",
            "This section will discuss different time series data by using some visual exploratory data analysis methods. We designed a worldwide map and provides a knowledge of how SARSCoV-2 spread from 22 January 2020 to 16 February 2020 all around the globe. Each map segment represents a region, by using visual data analytics it helps the individuals to understand the epidemiological nature of COVID-19. From the map representation, it is apparent that China reported the highest confirmed cases with a high number of 70,446. Likewise, China reported the highest number of death and it was 1765 (Till 16 February 2020). We also examine the time series data using visual EDA to provide a strong and understandable outcome of this extreme outbreak of COVID-19. It is obvious that analyzing these data in real-time is extremely useful in capturing an epidemic behavior of this severe disease. We believe this method of analyzing data will certainly increase the understanding of the situation and inform interventions. All the data analysis and visualization models that we have analyzed for this research article including EDA and VEDA are available at this URL (http://samratdey.me/visualization.html)."

        "3. Results": [
            "This research analyzed three different categories of data including confirmed, death and recovered cases inside china for a time period of 22 January to 16 February 2020. This will also provide a comparative analysis of all the cases reported inside and outside of China. However, we present different cases worldwide in order to comprehend the specific numbers of cases reported for a specific time period. After analyzing, there were 58182 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 16 February 2020. However, the highest number of deaths reported in China on 16 February 2020 was 1696. Surprisingly, there was a significant number of recovered cases reported till 16 February 2020 and it was around 6639 ( Figure 1).",
            "Another investigation on different cases of COVID-19 including confirmed, death, and recovered reported outside China also provided in this research. This also contains three different data representations of confirmed, death and recovered cases outside China for a time period of 22 January 2020 to 16 February 2020. After analyzing the data, there were",
            "399 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 16 February 2020 globally. However, the highest number of deaths reported outside China on 16 February 2020 was 5. Surprisingly, there was also a significant number of recovered cases till 16 February 2020, and it is more than 100 according to the dataset we examined (Figure 2).",
            "Table 3 represents all the confirmed cases reported in China provinces between 22 January 2020 to 16 February 2020. For a better understanding of the scenario, we designed a Tree Map and visualize the data according to different criteria. Our designed Tree Map contains all the provinces that confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 patients in China. According to the Tree Map, it is evident that Hubei province reported the highest number of confirmed cases and the number was 58182. The next province is Guangdong with most 1316 confirmed cases reported. Alternately, we also visualize the Tree Map for the number of deaths and recovered cases reported between 22 January 2020 to 16 February 2020. The highest number of deaths reported in Hubei province in China. The greatest number of deaths reported in Hubei was 1696 till 16 February 2020 and the next highest number found in Henan with 13 deaths reported till the mentioned date. However, 6639 successful recovered cases were reported in Hubei and 465 were in Guangdong, 464 were in Hunan (Table 3). Moreover, a Tree Map representation for all the countries that have reported confirmed, deaths and recovered cases globally (except China) also provided in this exploration. Singapore reported the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 immediately after China with a number of 75 and Japan with a confirmed case of 59 is in the next position after Singapore. In terms of deaths reported globally except China, all the five countries (France, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines) reported 1 death case between 22 January 2020 to 16 February 2020 (Table 3). However, Singapore reported the highest number of recovered cases of 2019-nCoV with a number of 18 and Thailand with a recovered case of 14 is in the next position after Singapore in terms of recovery.",
            "Figure 3 enlist the data of comparative analysis (Confirmed=C, Recovered=R, and Deaths=D) of Hubei, other provinces of China and the rest of the world till 16 February 2020. This representation demonstrates that Hubei has endured the largest number of infected patients (C=58 182). However, Hubei has also maintained a significant recovery rate of (R=6639) patients along with the mortalities of (D=1969) persons. On the other hand, rest of the provinces in China has confirmed (C=12264) patients infected by SARSCOV-2 virus till 16 February 2020. Like Hubei, other province in China also showed a dramatic recovery rate of (R=4109) patients along with confirmed deaths of (D=69) persons. As of 16 February 2020, data from the different sources showed that there was a total of (C=425) confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. Among them, only 5 deaths have been reported globally with a steady recovery rate of (R=117) patients. From the observation, it is apparent that there has been a steady rise in the daily total number of COVID-19 cases globally, both within and outside China till 16 February 2020. Regarding new cases of COVID-19, till 24 February 2020, both within and outside China there has been a dramatic increase in the number of new cases. It was reported that China has confirmed (n=415, out of 77 262 confirmed) new cases while the rest of the world has confirmed (n=300, out of 2069 confirmed) caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus."

        "4. Discussion": [
            "Another example of the importance of animal-human interface infections is the current outbreak of the COVID-19 disease. And the issues resulting from the advent of a newly identified organism as it spreads through individuals and across national and international frontiers. At the advent of an outbreak such as this, readily available data and information are equally important to begin the evaluation needed to understand the risks and start containment outbreak activities. Such information includes initial reports of countries with confirmed, death and recovered cases ratio, also, how the countries outside china are affecting, how the province of china are struggling to handle the situation of COVID-19 and more importantly ratio analysis of these real-world data, as well as information obtained from specific regions of globally from past outbreaks. Information and understanding of the consequences are needed to help refine the risk assessment as the outbreak continues and to ensure that patients are best managed. Much of this information emerges in real-time, challenges our understanding, yet refines our responses. The analysis presented here based on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visual exploratory data analysis (V-EDA) with the help of the dataset provided by John Hopkins University, World Health Organization (WHO), Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Health Commission (NHC), and DXY. However, we have preprocessed and cleaned the dataset information according to our needs. For storing and analyzing the data, we have used the python-based library of NumPy (https://numpy.org/) and pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org). Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org), Plotly (https://plot.ly), Seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org), and Folium were also used to visualize the highlighted data in an interactive manner. All the experiment with the dataset has been made by using the support of Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org) in a Linux based local machine platform by using Python Language in the Machine Learning research lab at the Dhaka International University (DIU). We report here each and every single detail of different cases of COVID-19 between 22 January 2020 to 16 February 2020. Currently, there is an obvious urgency to understand the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 viruses not only in China but also worldwide to aware of ourselves for upcoming days. Therefore, this is a minor initiative of analyzing real-world time series data and visualize them in such a manner so that peoples around the globe have better understandings of its severe nature. We are still observing the undesirable prevalence of this SARS-CoV-2 virus and to date 24 February 2020 the number of death cases reported was 2618 and among them, only 23 death cases reported outside China. This is extremely alarming not only to China but to the rest of the world as well. In this research, we have enlisted the most reported cases in China, outside China and in different provinces in China. We also analyzed the number of affected countries with reported confirmed, deaths and recovered cases. Apart from that, we designed Map view and Treemap's view with an appropriate number to analyze the epidemiological outbreak of the COVID-19."

        "5. Conclusion": [
            "In conclusion, the dataset we have used for our experiment 2019 Coronavirus dataset (January - February 2020), COVID-19 (nCOV-19) Corona Virus Spread Dataset, and Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset can be useful to monitor the emerging outbreaks, such as 2019-nCoV. Such activities can help generate and disseminate detailed information to the scientific community, especially in the early stages of an outbreak when there is little else available, allowing for independent assessments of key parameters that influence interventions. We observe an interesting different case reported based on the different datasets of 2019-nCoV, which helps us to understand that it needs more epidemiological and serological studies. We also investigated early indications that the response is being strengthened in China and worldwide on the basis of a decrease in the case of detection time and rapid management of internationally identified travel-related cases. As a caveat, this is an early data analysis and visualization approach of a situation that is rapidly evolving. To best of our knowledge, this is the very first attempt on COVID-19 which focuses on the visual exploratory data analysis based on different data sources. However, knowledge about this novel SARS-CoV-2 virus remains limited among general people around the globe. Raw data released by various sources are not adequately capable to provide an informative understanding of COVID-19, caused of SARS CoV-2. Therefore, A user-friendly data visualization model will be more effective to understand the epidemic outbreak of this severe disease. Visualization model like Map view and Tree Map View provides an interactive interface and visualize each and every raw fact in a comprehensive manner. Hopefully, in the coming weeks, we will continue to monitor this outbreak's epidemiology data that we have used in this research and from other official sources.",
