Six coronavirus species are known to cause human infection, four of which typically cause cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals, while the other two namely SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) both zoonotic in origin were implicated in 2002 and 2003 outbreaks in Guangdong, China and 2012 outbreaks in the Middle East and can cause severe respiratory illness and fatalities.",

Incubation period appears to range between two days to up to two weeks following exposure. To date the severity of illness has tended to be mild, however deaths have been reported. There is concern that patients with mild symptoms may more easily spread the virus due to not seeking medical attention. No vaccine exists to prevent infection; therefore, early identification and prevention of transmission is of paramount importance.",
            "Healthcare professionals\u2019 education is imperative as a majority of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases were associated with healthcare-associated transmission. Based on experience with previous such outbreaks, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease can be at high risk for adverse outcomes.",
