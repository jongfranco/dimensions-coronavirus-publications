        "abstract": "A novel coronavirus pneumonia initially identified in Wuhan, China and provisionally named 2019-nCoV has surged in the public. In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan. We applied a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units, given the scenarios of different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy. Our estimates suggest the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with estimated 26,701 cases (as of 28th January 2020) assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented. The estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is achieved.",

Thus, the probabilities of recovering if not being hospitalised within any given day (self_recover) was estimated by 1 divided by the average number of days needed to recover. We also assumed that, if being admitted to the hospital, the average number of days in isolation ward and ICU to be 20 and 25 days, respectively.

We also assumed that a total of 5% of the confirmed cases admitted to isolation ward would experience deterioration of the symptoms and be transferred to ICU. Therefore, in any one day, the probability of being transferred to ICU from isolation ward (ICU_after_Isolation) was estimated by 5% divided by the average number of days in isolation ward. We considered an overall death rate of 14% among the hospitalised cases according to the recent investigation by researchers from the University of Hong Kong.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Therefore, the probability of being dead within any given day in the ICU (death_rate) was estimated by 14% divided by the average number of days in ICU.

Sustained human transmission (i.e., basic reproduction number R0 > 1) is supported by the confirmed human-to-human transmissibility.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] Therefore, upstream measures that limit or block the viral transmission between individuals within and across cities are urgently needed. Fortunately, the lockdown of Wuhan city has taken place and is believed to have largely minimised the spreads from the epicentre to other areas.

In light of no available specific vaccines and treatments for such novel coronavirus thus far, a range of precautionary behaviours between individuals at homes and in communities are essential and vital to obtain proper control of the spreads in public and likely preventing superspreading events. Personal prevention strategies for seasonal influenza and other viral infections are still applicable during the present outbreak, inclusive of restricting ill residents from common activities, excluding symptomatic persons from entering homes/facilities, limiting visit especially of wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. Maintaining personal hygiene (e.g., frequently performing hand hygiene, washing hands with soap and water) and cough etiquette (e.g., covering nose and mouth when coughing, correctly disposing wasted tissues after coughing) are also beneficial.",
            "Amongst these preventive practices, facemask wear appears to be the most operationalised and thus effective since it is observable from other members of the public. A recent cluster randomised controlled trial[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], consisting of multiple region-varying medical settings, showed both N95 respirators and medical masks can effectively prevent influenza and other viral respiratory infections. Apart from facemask wear being required in public of the epicentre city in Hubei province, it has also been mandated by the Guangdong provincial government that facemasks should be worn in public with effect from 26th January, four days after the implementation in Wuhan. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States, also emphasised the importance of wearing a facemask at all times when staying with infected individuals in shared spaces as one of precautions for large-scale spreads in community, specified in their interim guidance for prevention for 2019-nCoV from spreading in home and communities[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. All these are extremely important in raising awareness in the public as to personal preventive steps given the present situation (mild or subclinical symptoms observed in many cases and observed long incubation period). Operational issues associated with wearing disposable facemasks to maximise their preventive effectiveness should be also publicised and educated to the general public including correct ways of wearing facemask, hygiene practices across the procedure of mask wearing, disposal of used masks.",

We believe that these volunteering activities can contribute to a successful delivery of public health principle and, in turn, efficacious interventions.",
            "The basic reproductive number of this novel coronavirus has been estimated in recent studies (range from 2.6 to 6.47)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], suggesting its spread being as similar as or more efficient than seasonal influenza. Our estimates also indicate that a country-wide outbreak or even an international outbreak is foreseeable. It is thus essential to implement effective public health measures to curb this very outbreak without delay. Otherwise, the current healthcare system would not be able to sustain. Once the breakdown occurred, mortality would be expected to soar due to lack of medical resources. Home isolation for patients with mild symptoms could be one of the possible managements if the ultimate limit of isolation beds at the city or province level was exceeded.",
            "We hope that all the essential measures mentioned above can be inclusively implemented so as to achieve at least 70% efficacy as our projection. Any primary preventive steps are expected to be contributed to the curb on viral transmission and ultimately bring about the emergency situation to a controllable level via a functioning healthcare system.",
            "To conclude, our estimates of the healthcare system burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were implemented. We call for continuation of implemented antitransmission measures (e.g., lockdown of city, closure of schools and facilities, suspension of",
            "public transport) and further effective large-scale interventions spanning all subgroups of populations (e.g., universal facemask wear) with an aim to obtain overall efficacy with at least 70%-90% to ensure the functioning of and avoid the breakdown of healthcare system.",
