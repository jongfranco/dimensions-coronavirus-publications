            "Wuhan has been identified as a principal financial hub for central China. It is a significant transportation and trade center, hosting the headquarters of the nation's major local steel and vehicle makers. The city also serves as home to more than 300 factories of the world's best 500 companies, including Microsoft, German software company SAP, and French car maker Groupe PSA.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] In recent years, its monetary development has been recorded to have surpassed China's national growth, with a GDP growth of 7.8% in 20192 as against the national average of 6.1%.3 After the spreading of the recent viral disease, numerous firms have now evacuated their expat workers from the city and temporarily halted business activities. The strict travel restrictions that have been enforced in Wuhan and different urban communities in Hubei are expected to have ripple effects throughout China and beyond, as far as trade is concerned. Among the industries that would be negatively impacted, retail, tourism, and hospitality sectors are likely to be most affected.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]",
            "With over 70 000 movie theatres closed down in mainland China,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and several airlines canceling flights to and from China \u2013 disrupting tourism and other business activities \u2013 the economic impact of the novel coronavirus is already extending beyond the borders of Hubei. This impact is quite obvious in the rattled stock market.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] It is quite interesting how the lockdown of a province with a population just a bit less than that of France or the UK has threatened to be a blow to the global economy. This could be said to be amplified by the thorough integration of China, the second\u2010largest economy behind the US, with the rest of the world. During the SARS\u2010CoV outbreak in China from 2002 to 2003, the global economy was estimated to have lost roughly $40 billion.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Currently, as China has an economy 8 to 9 times larger than it had during the SARS epidemic, and is even more connected to the rest of the world, experts believe that the total impact of the 2019\u2010nCoV on global economy could be quite huge.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] As China now contributes approximately 16.3% of the world's GDP, the country has been the main growth driver worldwide, with the IMF estimating that China alone accounted for 39% of global economic growth in 2019.10 This implies that any slowdown in the nation's economy could likely send waves across the global economy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Figure 1 presents the growth of China's GDP and its share of the global GDP from 2003 to 2018."
