These strategies now include germline-targeting, lineage-based, and structure-guided immunogen design. This narrative review outlines the historical context of HIV vaccinology and subsequently highlights the scientific discoveries during the last 6 years that promise to propel the field forward.",

Several of these strategies have shown enough promise in animal models to progress toward first-in-human Phase I clinical trials.
