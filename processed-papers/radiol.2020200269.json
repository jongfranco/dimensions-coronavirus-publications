            "Anew type of pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) broke out in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. On January 1, 2020, a 42-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of Union Hospital (Tongji Medical College, Wuhan, Hubei Province) due to a high-grade fever (39.6\u00b0C [103.28\u00b0C]), cough, and fatigue for 1 week. Bilateral coarse breath sounds with wet rales distributed at the bases of both lungs were heard on auscultation. Laboratory studies showed leukopenia (white blood cell count, 2.88 3 109/L) and lymphocytosis (lymphocyte cell count, 0.90 3 109/L). The white blood cell differential count displayed 56.6% neutrophils, 32.1% lymphocytes, and 10.2% monocytes. Several additional laboratory tests were abnormal, including C-reactive protein (158.95 mg/L; normal range, 0\u201310 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (38 mm/h; normal range, ,20 mm/h), serum amyloid A protein (607.1 mg/L; normal range, ,10 mg/L), aspartate aminotransferase (53 U/L; normal range, 8\u201340 U/L), and alanine aminotransferase (60 U/L; normal range, 5\u201340 U/L). Real-time \u00f1uorescence polymerase chain reaction of the patient\u2019s sputum was positive for the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. The patient was treated with antiviral drugs (ganciclovir, oseltamivir) and anti-inflammatory drugs (meropenem, linezolid), with supportive care from January 1, 2020, until his discharge on January 25, 2020. Serial imaging studies in the Figure illustrate the patient\u2019s improvement after therapy."
