        "abstract": "On 31st December 2019, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus, now named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from the affected patients. Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the reported RdRp-P2 assay which is used in &gt;30 European laboratories. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 TCID50/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRd-P2-negative specimens [119/273 (43.6%) vs 77/273 (28.2%), P&lt;0.001], including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens. The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21\u00d7104 RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21\u00d7102 to 4.71\u00d7105 RNA copies/ml). The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture. The highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.",

All experimental protocols involving live SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV followed the approved standard operating procedures of the Biosafety Level 3 facility as previously described [23, 24].

We postulated that this might be due to the small number (n=3) of nucleotide differences between the probe used in the RdRp-P2 assay with at least 3 strains of SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. This cross-reactivity would be especially important for laboratories in areas where SARS-CoV might re-emerge and co-circulate with SARS-CoV-2, as the clinical progressions of SARS and COVID-19 remain incompletely understood at this stage.",
            "The main limitation of this study was that the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays were performed using different commercially available reagents, primer/probe concentrations, and cycling conditions, which made it challenging to determine the root of the difference in sensitivity. Nevertheless, our data showed that the newly established COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in vitro and in respiratory and non-respiratory tract clinical specimens. The use of this novel RT-PCR assay might be especially useful for detecting COVID-19 cases with low viral loads and when testing upper respiratory tract, saliva, and plasma specimens of patients.
