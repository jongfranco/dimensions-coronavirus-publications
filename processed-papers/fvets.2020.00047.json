        "abstract": "Canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to the Morbillivirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family, which causes a threat to the domestic dog and fur-animal industry. Hemagglutinin protein is a major membrane protein of the vital molecular factor in CDV tropism, also known to induce hosts to produce neutralizing antibodies. In the current study, we prepared two monoclonal antibodies, 1A5 and 2B8, against the H protein of the CDV-PS strain. A series of partially overlapping synthetic peptides covering the hemagglutinin protein (amino acids 50\u2013204) were screened to define the linear epitope identified by 1A5 and 2B8 mAbs. 120QKTNFFNPNREFDFR134 (F8) and 178ARGDIFPPY186 (F14-1) are minimal linear epitopes recognized by 1A5 and 2B8 mAbs, respectively. Further investigations revealed that F8 is conserved in different CDV strains; however, F14-1 contains mutant residues 178, 179, and 180. The epitopes F8 and F14-1 localized at the surface of hemagglutinin protein in a three-dimensional (3D) structure. CDV-infected dog serum can also recognize the identified B-cell epitopes.",

            "Canine distemper is a contagious disease with multisystem infection caused by canine distemper virus (CDV), which affects the health of multiple species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The disease is characterized by high fever, diarrhea, encephalitis, immunosuppression, and other symptoms. The high mortality and morbidity of dogs and fur animals result in serious economic losses. The emergence of canine distemper has been continuously reported in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Therefore, controlling the spread of CDV still faces enormous challenges. CDV is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded negative RNA virus with a genome size of \u223c15.7 kb. The genome encodes nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin protein (H), and large protein (L).

            "Canine distemper is a contagious disease with multisystem infection caused by canine distemper virus (CDV), which affects the health of multiple species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The disease is characterized by high fever, diarrhea, encephalitis, immunosuppression, and other symptoms. The high mortality and morbidity of dogs and fur animals result in serious economic losses. The emergence of canine distemper has been continuously reported in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Therefore, controlling the spread of CDV still faces enormous challenges. CDV is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded negative RNA virus with a genome size of \u223c15.7 kb. The genome encodes nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin protein (H), and large protein (L). The CDV envelope consists of two integral glycoproteins, fusion protein (F) and hemagglutinin protein (H) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. The H gene contains 1,947 nucleotides, encoding 607 amino acids. The size of CDV H protein is \u223c78 kD. Embedded on the surface of the viral envelope, H protein can effectively induce the body to produce neutralizing antibodies and play an important role in antigenic recognition [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Recently, many studies reported the application of H protein in vaccines and diagnosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. The antigenic epitopes of CDV hemagglutinin protein have not been investigated clearly.",
            "In this study, two B-cell epitopes in H protein were identified by using specific mAbs to react with a series of truncated peptides in ELISA test. The epitope F8 is highly conserved among different isolates of CDV, and the epitope F14-1 contains three mutant residues. The localization of two epitopes on the surface of H protein makes it easy for F8 and F14-1 to induce an immune response during CDV infection. Furthermore, the current work actually provides potential uses for the development of diagnostic methods to detect CDV."

After blocking the membrane with 5% skim milk in TBST for 2 h at 37\u25e6C, the membranes were incubated with 1A5 and 2B8 (diluted 1:2,000 in 5% skim milk in TBST) at 37\u25e6C for 2 h, respectively. They were washed three times with TBST and then probed with a 1:2,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2013conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (CWBIO, China) at 37\u25e6C for 1 h.

After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), the cells were probed with mAbs 1A5 and 2B8 for 2 h. After washing three times with PBST, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\u2013conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Abclonal, China). Finally, the plate was viewed by a fluorescence microscope (Nikon TS100, Japan).",
            "The mAb titers of 1A5 and 2B8 were determined by the established indirect ELISA method.

After the incubation, 100 \u03bcl of HRP-conjugated goat antimouse IgG was added at a dilution of 1:2,000, and the sample was incubated at 37\u25e6C for 1 h. The reaction was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm using tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate. Plates were coated with the mAb against canine parvovirus as the negative control. A value of P/N > 3 (positive/negative OD450 value) was the standard for the titer of mAbs.",
            "Through identification of the linear epitope with indirect ELISA, 15 overlapping synthetic peptides (15 aa) corresponding to the coding sequence of the truncated H protein (amino acids 50\u2013204) were synthesized. Each 15 aa peptide overlapped the previous peptide sequence by 5 aa residues. An indirect ELISA was used to scan peptides 1\u201315. Ninety-six-well plates were coated with 1.0 \u03bcg/ml of each synthesized peptide at 4\u25e6C overnight. Each coated plate was blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at 37\u25e6C.

        "RESULTS": [

Both of the mAbs did not recognize uninfected Vero proteins (Figure 1A). And the approximate size of the CDV H protein recognized by them is the same as the expected 78 kD.

These results indicate that mAbs 1A5 and 2B8 have good specificity and sensitivity for the development of diagnostic methods to detect CDV.",
            "In Figure 2A, mAb 1A5 recognized the sequence 170IILSAL SGARGDIFP184 (peptide13) and 180GDIFPPYRCSGATTS194 (peptide14). The core linear epitope might be represented",
            "by the sequence 180GDIFP184, which was the overlapping H protein sequence present in both peptides. The location of epitopes recognized by 2B8 is between amino acids 120 and 134 of H protein (Figure 2A). To further determine the minimal epitopes, we developed progressive single amino acid deletion at the N- or C-terminus of the 177GARGDIFPPYR187 (F14) and 120QKTNFFNPNREFDFR134 (F8) peptide sequence. A significant decrease could be observed when the peptide changed from F14-1 to F14-2. In Figure 2B, the OD450 value decreased from 2.00 to 1.19 when there was resection from the amino terminus of the polypeptide 120QKTNFFNPNREFDFR134. The minimum linear epitope recognized by 1A5 was 178ARGDIFPPY186, and it was 120QKTNFFNPNREFDFR134 for 2B8. The names and sequences of the peptides used are included in Figure 2C.",
            "The B-cell epitope recognized by 1A5 is not conserved among CDV strains (Figure 3A); however, the minimal linear epitope by 2B8 is highly conserved among these representative CDV isolates (Figure 3B). To the epitope F14-1, the mutation occurs at (yellow), (red), and (blue) amino acids. Combining phylogenetic tree (Figure 3C) and sequence alignment analysis, the epitope F14-1 is conserved in most Asia-1 genotype CDV strains except the CDV RD-JL strain. And the sequence alignment from 24 CDV strains revealed that the linear B-cell epitope of the mAb 2B8 is highly conserved among different CDV strains.",
            "Modeling of the CDV H protein was conducted to spatially localize the epitopes recognized by mAbs 1A5 and 2B8. The 3D structure of the head and stalk region of the H protein is not available. However, we were able to localize the identified epitopes on a predicted 3D structure (SWISS-MODEL online server). The structural model demonstrated that the epitopes recognized by mAbs are shown to be fully exposed on the surface of the protein (Figure 4A). 120QKTNFFNPNREFDFR134 (red) is near the start region of the N-terminal domain. The structural results imply that the epitope sequences F14-1 and F8 are meaningful B-cell epitopes on the H protein of CDV.",
            "The minimal identified B-cell epitopes can be recognized by positive dog serum. Conversely, the OD450 value of negative serum was reduced significantly (P < 0.001). The same trend also showed in negative control peptides of H protein. According to the data of Figure 4B, we can draw the conclusion that identified B-cell epitopes are targeted to dog immune response during the virus infection."

Due to antigenic differences between the vaccine strains and the currently circulating wildtype strains, current vaccines may provide incomplete protection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. So it\u2019s necessary to clarify the detailed sequence of linear B-cell epitopes of the CDV H protein.",
            "In this study, we generated two mAbs against CDV H protein and identified the characteristics of mAbs 1A5 and 2B8 by WB (Figure 1A) and IFA (Figure 1B). Furthermore, mAb 1A5 specifically binds epitopes with the exact core unit F14-1, and mAb 2B8 recognizes F8. Here the epitope 120QKTNFFNPNREFDFR134 was found to be conserved in different genotypes of CDV (Figure 3B). The IFA and WB test confirmed the sequence alignment results. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that 178ARGDIFPPY186 was conserved among most Asian-1 CDVs except CDV RD-JL (Figure 3A). So the specific mAb 1A5 can be used as a tool to differentiate CDV RD-JL from other CDV Asia-1 strains. The results of western blotting and conservation analysis of the epitopes demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody lost its characteristics when Ala became Gly at 178 and Gly became Ser at 180. The residues 178 and 180 may be the key determinants of F14-1 reactivity. Previous research indicated that the length of an epitope is usually 5 to 7 amino acids or does not exceed 20 amino acids [16]. In this study, the minimal linearized epitopes were 9 and 15 amino acids, which are consistent with the results obtained in the previous study. In addition, we used peptides of identified epitopes to verify the reactivity of CDV-positive dog serum. The result demonstrated that CDV-positive dog serum was able to recognize the identified B-cell epitopes.",
            "In summary, we generated two novel monoclonal antibodies (1A5, 2B8) and identified a highly conserved linear B-cell epitope against CDV H protein. The defined epitopes will enrich understanding of the immunological epitopes present in the CDV H protein. The study may also be useful for further developing the diagnostic tools for CDV infections."
