        "abstract": "An increasing number of critically ill patients are immunocompromised. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF), chiefly due to pulmonary infection, is the leading reason for ICU admission. Identifying the cause of ARF increases the chances of survival, but may be extremely challenging, as the underlying disease, treatments, and infection combine to create complex clinical pictures. In addition, there may be more than one infectious agent, and the pulmonary manifestations may be related to both infectious and non-infectious insults. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia accounts for one-third of cases of ARF in immunocompromised patients. Early antibiotic therapy is recommended but decreases the chances of identifying the causative organism(s) to about 50%. Viruses are the second most common cause of severe respiratory infections. Positive tests for a virus in respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate a role for the virus in the current acute illness. Invasive fungal infections (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Pneumocystis jirovecii) account for about 15% of severe respiratory infections, whereas parasites rarely cause severe acute infections in immunocompromised patients. This review focuses on the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. Special attention is given to newly validated diagnostic tests designed to be used on non-invasive samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and capable of increasing the likelihood of an early etiological diagnosis.",

Knowledge of the underlying immune deficiency and thorough clinico-radiological evaluation can guide the diagnostic strategy by targeting the most likely infectious agents and deciding on invasive versus non-invasive approach.

            "An increasing number of critically ill patients are immunocompromised. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF), chiefly due to pulmonary infection, is the leading reason for ICU admission. Identifying the cause of ARF increases the chances of survival, but may be extremely challenging, as the underlying disease, treatments, and infection combine to create complex clinical pictures. In addition, there may be more than one infectious agent, and the pulmonary manifestations may be related to both infectious and non-infectious insults. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia accounts for one-third of cases of ARF in immunocompromised patients. Early antibiotic therapy is recommended but decreases the chances of identifying the causative organism(s) to about 50%. Viruses are the second most common cause of severe respiratory infections. Positive tests for a virus in respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate a role for the virus in the current acute illness. Invasive fungal infections (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Pneumocystis jirovecii) account for about 15% of severe respiratory infections, whereas parasites rarely cause severe acute infections in immunocompromised patients. This review focuses on the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. Special attention is given to newly validated diagnostic tests designed to be used on non-invasive samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and capable of increasing the likelihood of an early etiological diagnosis.",

            "Existing guidelines for managing lung disease in critically ill immunocompromised patients emphasize the importance of obtaining valid diagnostic samples [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. However, antimicrobial therapy is often started immediately, before samples are collected. As a result, causative pathogens are identified in only about half the patients with bacterial pneumonia. A detailed analysis of the clinical, laboratory, and imaging-study findings can provide valuable diagnostic orientation in these cases. Nevertheless, the frequency of bacterial pneumonia is probably underestimated as many cases are atypical and, therefore, escape recognition. On the other hand, non-infectious pulmonary abnormalities may be mistakenly diagnosed as clinically documented infections.",
            "The basic rules shown in Table 1 provide helpful guidance for determining the cause of pulmonary infiltrates and selecting the appropriate diagnostic strategy. In immunocompromised patients with ARF, the first step in the etiological evaluation is a clinical assessment. We advocate the use of the mnemonic DIRECT (Table 2) based on days since respiratory symptom onset, type of immunodeficiency (Fig. 1), radiographic pattern, experience of the assessing clinician, clinical findings, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings (Fig. 2) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Most of these variables are easily evaluated at the bedside, and their analysis usually restricts the number of possible etiologies to two or three. Additional invasive and non-invasive investigations should be obtained as needed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. The diagnostic strategy should be tailored to the pretest probability of the disease being sought, which governs the diagnostic yield. Importantly, the indications of FOB/BAL are changing to avoid exposing patients to potential adverse events (Table 1). When FOB/BAL is considered as mandatory, it should be performed under optimal monitoring and high-flow oxygen therapy should be used to correct hypoxemia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. The risk for intubation should be assessed carefully as it is associated with higher mortality. The introduction of non-invasive tests, notably those based on next-generation sequencing (NGS), transcriptomics, and proteomics, may reduce the need for FOB/BAL [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>].

All immunocompromised patients with suspected respiratory infection should undergo a minimal diagnostic workup that must include a chest X ray, standard blood tests (blood cell counts, electrolytes, renal function test, liver enzymes, LDH level, and hemostasis parameters), blood cultures, sputum examination for bacteria, echocardiography, urine bacterial antigens, and viral PCRs on nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates",
            "4. When diagnostic yields are similar non-invasive diagnostic tests should be preferred over fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (FOB/BAL)",

When the initial evaluation suggests that a disease is unlikely, a test with a high negative predictive value should be preferred 8. When the initial evaluation suggests that a disease is likely, a test with high sensitivity should be preferred 9. When selecting the diagnostic strategy, the risk/benefit ratio must be assessed. FOB/BAL should be reserved for situations in which this approach has a high diagnostic yield (organ transplantation, associated HIV infection, systemic inflammatory joint disease, high probability of Pneumocystis pneumonia, diffuse ground-glass opacities) and discouraged in other situation (patients with malignancies, neutropenia, alveolar consolidations, or bronchial/bronchiolar disease) 10. Patients with respiratory distress and/or severe hypoxemia are at risk for respiratory deterioration following FOB/BAL. Non-invasive tests should be preferred. If FOB/BAL is indicated by the bedside physicians, high-flow nasal oxygen should be considered. Whether patients should be intubated for the procedure questions about the risk/ratio benefit and remains unsure for the authors",

To date, 200 NTM species have been identified. Human disease due to NTM is classified into four clinical syndromes: chronic pulmonary disease, lymphadenitis, cutaneous disease, and disseminated disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. Risk factors for disseminated disease are similar to those for tuberculosis and include HIV infection, steroids, TNF\u03b1 antagonists, diabetes, cancer, and SOT. Patients present with a cough, fatigue, malaise, weakness, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and, occasionally, hemoptysis. The extra-pulmonary manifestations seen in disseminated disease consist of arthritis, tenosynovitis, skin lesions, and gastrointestinal manifestations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]. Fever and weight loss are less common than in patients with tuberculosis. Because NTMs exist in the environment, their presence in nonsterile respiratory specimens does not necessarily indicate a role in causing lung disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. The American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) diagnostic criteria for NTM lung disease are as follows: pulmonary symptoms; compatible radiographic findings; and two positive sputum cultures or one positive BAL sample or other evidence of NTM such as a positive lung-biopsy culture with compatible histological features [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. In disseminated disease, blood culture on special media should be performed. Mycobacterial cultures must be kept for at least 6 weeks. Bone marrow or fluid or tissue samples from suspected sites of involvement should be sent for culture and histological examination with special stains.

The virus is often acquired in the community and brought into the transplant ward by staff, where it may mimic other opportunistic infections, thereby raising diagnostic challenges [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>]. The hMPV is closely related to RSV and often causes severe infections requiring mechanical ventilation in patients who are elderly and/or have comorbidities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>]. Rhinoviruses/ enteroviruses are Picornaviridae that circulate throughout the year and are increasingly recognized as a cause of lower respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>].

Molecular amplification techniques have largely superseded cell cultures as the primary means of detecting and identifying viruses in clinical samples. PCR is now the reference standard diagnostic test [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. The IDSA recommends that all immunocompromised patients presenting with acute onset of respiratory symptoms be tested for influenza. PCR-based diagnostic panels can detect multiple respiratory viruses simultaneously within 2\u20133 h [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. These new sensitive methods increase the ability to identify a broader range of viruses, such as rhinovirus, whose clinical significance should be carefully assessed.

An important consideration when choosing the sampling technique is the clinical condition of the patient. In patients receiving mechanical ventilation, endotracheal aspirates or BAL fluid should be collected, even when influenza tests on upper respiratory tract specimens are negative [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>].

When a virus is identified in the respiratory tract, differentiating colonization from infection may be challenging [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. However, presence of the influenza virus usually indicates infection. In RSV infection, blood testing may be helpful, as RSV-RNA was detected in plasma samples of one-third of HSCT patients with pulmonary RSV infection and was associated with a poor outcome [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>].",

The herpes viruses responsible for pneumonia include herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), varicella\u2013zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Herpes viruses are known to establish lifelong infections and can often reactivate during episodes of immunosuppression [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>]. Adenoviridae include human adenoviruses (HAdV) A to G, each of which produces a different clinical pattern.

Risk factors change over time with the changes in immunosuppression [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>]. Viral infections are most common in patients with T-cell deficiencies and are of particular concern in those taking high-dose steroids (\u2265 20 mg/day for \u2265 4 weeks) or having received T-cell-depleted allogeneic HSCT or treatment with alemtuzumab or fludarabine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>]. Viral infections may be community-acquired or opportunistic, arise due to reactivation of latent infection, come from a transplant donor, or come from the transplant recipient (e.g., CMV reactivation when a seronegative patient receives a solid transplant from a seropositive donor or when a seropositive recipient receives an HSCT from a seronegative donor) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>]. Endogenous reactivation appears to be the predominant cause of viral disease in severely immunocompromised patients.",

The lung infiltrates typically appear as a crazy-paving pattern, ground-glass opacities, micronodules, and/or consolidations. A definite diagnosis of CMV pneumonia requires clinical symptoms of pneumonia and identification of CMV in lung tissue by virus isolation, rapid culture, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, or DNA hybridization techniques [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. Probable CMV pneumonia is defined as clinical symptoms and/or signs of pneumonia combined with CMV detection by viral isolation, rapid BAL fluid culture, or CMV DNA quantitation in BAL fluid. No reliable cut-off for the CMV DNA load has been established, however. Furthermore, CMV shedding may occur in the lower respiratory tract, and the CMV DNA load may, therefore, be low in patients with asymptomatic infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. On the other hand, a negative CMV DNA test in BAL fluid has nearly 100% negative predictive value and, therefore, excludes CMV pneumonia, assuming satisfactory sampling.

The risk factors consist chiefly of severe and prolonged neutropenia, acute myeloid leukemia, HSCT, high-dose steroid therapy, and drugs or conditions that chronically impair the T-cell responses. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is most common in patients exposed to heavy fungal loads, for instance on construction sites [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c79\" href=\"#r79\">79</a>]. The cumulative incidence of IA 12 months after SOT was 0.7% in one study and was highest in lung transplant recipients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>]. In HSCT recipients, the incidence at 12 months was 1.6% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>]. Cryptococcus spp. are yeasts that can affect the lungs and central nervous system in patients with impaired T cell-mediated responses. C. neoformans and C. gattii account for most cases of cryptococcosis. Reactivation of dormant organisms is probably the main mechanism of lung involvement. Risk factors for pulmonary cryptococcosis include malignancies, HSCT, SOT, cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, and treatment with steroids or TNF\u03b1 antagonists [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>]. In SOT recipients, cryptococcosis accounted for about 8% of invasive fungal infections, with an overall incidence of 0.2\u20135% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>]. Mucorales causes aggressive invasive infections in patients with hematological malignancies and in HSCT recipients. Fusarium mostly affects patients with hematological malignancies and HSCT recipients and involves the lungs and sinuses. Other pulmonary fungal infections are shown in Table 5.",
            "Patients with pulmonary fungal infections present with nonspecific symptoms such as a fever, cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and/or hemoptysis. Extra-pulmonary symptoms may help to suspect invasive fungal disease. In IA, HRCT shows macronodules with a halo sign, pleuralbased wedge-shaped consolidations, or masses. Mucormycosis and IA share clinical and radiological findings, but mucormycosis should be suspected in the presence of sinus involvement, prior voriconazole therapy, or a reversed halo sign on HRCT. In P. jirovecii pneumonia, HRCT shows bilateral ground-glass opacities predominating at the apices and sparing the periphery. The most common findings in pulmonary cryptococcosis are solitary or sparse, well-defined, non-calcified nodules that are often pleural-based [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>].",
            "Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are classified as proven (signs of infection and fungus identified by histopathology, cytopathology, or culture), probable (based on host factors, clinical criteria, microscopy, culture, galactomannan antigen [GM], or possible (based on host factors and clinical criteria) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>]. The diagnosis of P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) relies on identification of the pathogen by immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR (on BAL fluid ideally and induced sputum otherwise); serum BDG testing can be helpful for difficult cases where there is a discrepancy between the clinical picture and PCR findings, or to make the difference between colonization and infection when PCR findings are in the gray zone [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>]. In a study of HIV-negative immunocompromised patients, quantitative PCR on BAL fluid was 87% sensitive and 92% specific and helped to differentiate infection and colonization [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>]. According to a meta-analysis, the serum BDG assay is 95% sensitive and 86% specific [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>]. In IA (Figure S1), BAL microscopy and culture show branching septate hyphae. Aspergillus spp. grows in 2\u20135 days, but the culture yield is low. When IA is suspected in patients at high risk due to a hematological malignancy, HSCT, or SOT, serum Aspergillus PCR and GM testing are recommended (Fig. 1). PCR and GM testing may perform better on BAL fluid than on serum, although FOB/BAL should be done only if indicated by a careful risk/benefit assessment [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>]. Serum BDG testing is recommended in highrisk patients, but is not specific for IA. A 2015 systematic review found that sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IA were 81.6% and 91.6% for serum GM and 76.9% and 89.4% for serum BDG, compared to 77\u201388% sensitivity and 75\u201395% specificity for PCR [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>]. Mucormycosis is diagnosed by sample microscopy, culture, and/or histopathology. Immunohistochemistry is 100% sensitive and 100% specific [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>]. Mucorales fungi contain neither BDG nor GM, and negative results from these tests in a patient whose HRCT findings are consistent with IFI, therefore, suggest mucormycosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>]. However, concomitant Aspergillus infection is possible. The diagnosis of Cryptococcus pneumonia, whether isolated or with central nervous system involvement, relies on visualization of the pathogen by microscopy or on culturing of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and/or sputum, in which Cryptococcus grows within 2\u20133 days. The cryptococcal antigen assay is less sensitive in HIV-negative than in HIV-positive patients: values of 56\u201383% have been reported in HIV-negative immunocompromised patients with Cryptococcus pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>].",
            "PJP is treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>]. The addition of steroid therapy in severe forms is currently not recommended in HIV-negative patients, but is being assessed in a randomized-controlled trial (NCT02944045). IA is treated with voriconazole [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>]. The first-line treatment for mucormycosis is liposomal amphotericin B, although isavuconazole constitutes a valid alternative [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>]. Severe cryptococcus pneumonia requires amphotericin B and flucytosine followed by fluconazole [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>]. Fusarium infections are managed with voriconazole or amphotericin B [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c96\" href=\"#r96\">96</a>].",
            "New diagnostic methods are being developed to allow earlier diagnosis with greater sensitivity in patients with fungal infections. Assays for Mucorales-specific antigen or T cells and Mucorales PCR have shown good sensitivity and specificity with earlier positivity compared to cultures [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>]. In patients with IFIs, mass spectrometry to detect panfungal serum disaccharide was 51% and 64% sensitive for diagnosing invasive candidiasis and IA, respectively, with higher specificities of 87% and 95%, respectively; for mucormycosis, the test made a similar contribution to the diagnosis as did quantitative PCR [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c98\" href=\"#r98\">98</a>].",
            "Although survival has improved over time, IA remains an often fatal complication after HSCT. In a retrospective study of patients with hematological malignancies who developed ARF due to IA, 1-year mortality was 72% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c99\" href=\"#r99\">99</a>]. Mortality in transplant recipients was 49.4%, with a higher rate after HSCT (57.5%) than after SOT (34.4%) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c100\" href=\"#r100\">100</a>]. PJP is more often fatal in HIV-negative than in HIV-positive patients, and in HIV-negative patients, mortality varies widely, from 18% to 50%, depending on the underlying disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c101\" href=\"#r101\">101</a>]. Finally, mortality rates of up to 66% have been reported in patients with pulmonary mucormycosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c102\" href=\"#r102\">102</a>].",

            "Streptococcus stercoralis is a nematode that infects humans through skin contact with larvae containing soil. The prevalence varies across geographic areas, with Africa, South America, and Asia being regions of high endemicity. About 30\u2013100 million people may be infected worldwide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c110\" href=\"#r110\">110</a>]. In industrialized countries, strongyloidiasis is seen in immigrants, tourists, and military personnel returning from endemic areas [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c111\" href=\"#r111\">111</a>]. In a US cohort of kidney transplant candidates, 9.9% were seropositive for S. stercoralis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c112\" href=\"#r112\">112</a>]. Risk factors include walking barefoot, engaging in work that involves skin contact with soil, and poor sanitary conditions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c111\" href=\"#r111\">111</a>].",
            "Streptococcus stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome (SSIS) occurs when chronically infected patients become immunosuppressed (notably those receiving steroids), or if immunosuppressed patients develop acute strongyloidiasis. This results in uncontrolled over-proliferation of larvae with dissemination to end-organs, including the lungs, liver, and brain [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c113\" href=\"#r113\">113</a>]. HTLV-1 infection is also a major risk factor for SSIS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c114\" href=\"#r114\">114</a>]. Patients present with nonspecific respiratory symptoms such as a cough, fever, hemoptysis, asthma, and ARF. The gastrointestinal symptoms include ileus and hemorrhage. Chest imaging may reveal nodular, reticular, or alveolar opacities, which may reflect a combination of edema, hemorrhage, and pneumonitis. Gram-negative sepsis is a common complication of SSIS, as larval invasion of the gut wall promotes bacterial translocation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c115\" href=\"#r115\">115</a>]. During SSIS, filariform larvae may be found in bodily fluids such as sputum, BAL, and pleural, and/or peritoneal fluid.

            "As survival of cancer patients improves and breakthrough therapies are being developed, rising numbers of critically ill patients are immunocompromised. Severe bacterial pneumonias, followed by viral, fungal, and more rarely parasitic infections are the leading cause for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. When ICU admission is needed, mortality rates are high. Knowledge of the underlying immune deficiency and thorough clinico-radiological evaluation can guide the diagnostic strategy by targeting the most likely infectious agents and deciding on invasive versus non-invasive approach. Increasingly sophisticated non-invasive diagnostic tools avoid clinical deterioration sometimes encountered with invasive approaches and are now available or under evaluation (e.g., real-time PCR, nextgeneration sequencing, and transcriptomics), which",
