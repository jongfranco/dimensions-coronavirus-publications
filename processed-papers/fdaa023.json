            "Global advocacy groups have named 2020 a \u2018super year\u2019 for activism and action. They advocate activism and action to reach the people furthest behind and rebalancing the relationship between people and nature through supporting both local initiatives and innovation. Virginia Berridge\u2019s 2007 BMJ article \u2018Public health activism: lessons from history?\u201916 outlines how knowledge about public health campaigns from the past can help current health campaigners to draw up effective strategies. She argues that networks of health organizations and pressure groups are vital as they have \u2018first established the area of concern at the national (and sometimes local) level and then developed it internationally\u2019. Berridge\u2019s article is as relevant today as it was over a decade ago. She states \u2018activism has a dual and interconnected rationale\u2014pushing for policy change but also helping to achieve cultural change\u2019.",
