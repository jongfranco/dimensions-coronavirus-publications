        "abstract": "Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are common causes of respiratory illnesses (RI) despite preexisting humoral immunity. Sera were obtained near the onset of RI and 3 to 4 weeks later as part of a prospective study of 200 subjects evaluated for RI from 2009 to 2013. Antibodies against common HCoV strains were measured by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases (99 subjects) to younger, healthy adults (101 subjects). Virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction. Of 43 HCoV\u2010associated illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (aged \u226560 years) and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (aged 21\u201040 years). Binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults. Only 16 (35.7%) of RI with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to HCoV. Increases in binding antibodies with RI were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding, and more frequent in younger compared to older adults. Functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies, explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with HCoV. Monitoring binding antibodies may be more sensitive for the serologic detection of HCoV infections.",

            "Antibodies to HCoV\u2010229E, \u2010NL63, \u2010OC43, and \u2010HKU1 may be cross\u2010reactive among viral strains, at least within each HCoV genus due to conserved viral antigenic epitopes, may include those with neutralizing function, and be induced by repeated infections earlier in life.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>\u2010<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] Hence, serologic reactivity to these common HCoV strains may be different among chronically ill older adults compared to younger adults. In a previous study of older adults with underlying chronic pulmonary disease,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] we reported that serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to all four HCoV strains were prevalent in most study subjects, but mucosal immunoglobulin A antibodies to the four common HCoV strains in nasal wash specimens were detected in a minority of patients. Mucosal immune responses also deserve further study with respect to mitigation of HCoV infections. Although, the COVID\u201019 strain may target infection of the lower respiratory tree due to its purported receptor usage.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]",

We assessed correlations between serum binding and neutralizing antibodies, and compared these antibody responses in older chronically ill adults to healthy young adults."

Of the 43 illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (group 1, mean age = 67.8 \u00b1 7.5 years; min, max: 60, 85 years), and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (group 2, mean age = 31.4 \u00b1 5.7 years; min, max: 21, 40 years). A total of 42 RI had a more than threefold increase in binding antibody to one or more HCoV strains comparing acute to convalescent serum antibody titers, including 14 RI with a more than threefold increase to two or three strains, and one RI with HCoV\u2010OC43 in respiratory secretions with no increase in binding antibody.

        "4 | DISCUSSION": [
            "Reinfection with coronaviruses is reportedly common despite the presence of a humoral immune response.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] Except for one subject, only one RI was associated with HCoV infection per subject in our study. This lack of repeated HCoV infections may have been influenced by there being 0.98 RI per subject meeting eligibility criteria for assessment during the study, and it is not known how often a clinically significant natural exposure to HCoV might have occurred causing risk for infection. Since preexisting serum antibodies were present, they did not necessarily provide protection from infection with HCoV, but may have reduced the number of clinically evaluable infections and severity. The PCR was positive for HCoV nucleic acids only in a minority of RI in this study, so antibodies may have reduced virus shedding that was detectable in respiratory secretions during acute illness. Time of specimen collection after onset of RI could have affected PCR positivity rates, as well. A seroconversion threshold for binding antibody titers of more than threefold in association with",
            "|5 acute RI was an inconsistent predictor of concomitant fourfold neutralizing antibody change, and \u2265fourfold changes in binding antibodies were not statistically better. Antibody GMTs to each HCoV strain did not increase statistically comparing acute to convalescent sera calculated with values from all 43 illnesses. These GMTs were calculated because of the evidence for cross\u2010reactive antibody responses against at least related strains (Alphacoronaviruses vs Betacoronaviruses). Choosing to calculate a separate GMT for only the subset of sera with a more than threefold change to one HCoV strain would have assured a significant rise in GMT for that strain against which there was this more than threefold binding antibody change.",
            "There were fewer numbers of HCoV infections and of reported RI overall in older patients. This could be consistent with higher antibody levels or other immune mechanisms of protection compared to younger patients. Enrollment binding antibody titers were higher in group 1 than group 2 subjects. However, the actual proportion of RI that were associated with HCoV by serologic change or PCR was not different comparing the two groups. A total of 15 (20.3%) of 74 RI in group 1 were assessed as being associated with HCoV infection compared to 28 (23.1%) of 121 illnesses in group 2. It is not known what might constitute a protective antibody level against HCoV infection.",
            "Concomitant increases in binding antibody to more than one viral strain were likely due to the stimulation of antibodies against conserved cross\u2010reactive antigens expressed by the current infecting strain of HCoV and, due to recall of immune memory, to other strains that previously infected the person earlier in life. Concomitant infection with more than one strain of HCoV during the same RI would be unlikely. Repeated infections with HCoV may partially be explained if natural infection in these adult patients stimulates binding antibodies more commonly than functional neutralizing antibodies. Nonneutralizing antibodies are known to bind to other viral proteins such as the N protein. Stimulation of antibodies to non\u2010S protein epitopes could be an explanation for low correlation between stimulation of binding antibody and neutralizing antibody since neutralizing antibody is directed against the S protein. The psoralen\u2010UV light method of virus inactivation used here should have preserved viral antigenicity, but we did not determine against which viral proteins the binding antibodies were directed. The orientation of the viral antigens coating the ELISA microtiter plates may have affected the epitopes exposed and available for antibody binding. Also, it is possible that some binding antibodies may enhance infection and not be protective against reinfection. Antibody\u2010dependent enhancement of SARS\u2010CoV and feline infectious peritonitis virus (a member of the coronavirus genus and antigenically related to \u2010229E) infectivity has been reported and can be mediated by antibodies to S protein epitopes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>\u2010<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] Also, studies of the S protein sequence and neutralization antigenicity suggest that serum antibodies which neutralize clinical HCoV isolates may not cross\u2010react as well with the laboratory strains of HCoV that were used in our neutralization assays, affecting the sensitivity of the neutralization assay that was employed here.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] Indeed, quasi\u2010species of HCoV\u2010OC43 were detected in respiratory secretions in our patients, with mutational peaks in the S1 region of the Spike protein that could lead to differences in antigenicity,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] and lower neutralization antibody levels and response rates against laboratory\u2010adapted strains.",
            "Older (group 1) subjects had higher levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies both before and after acute RI than younger subjects (group 2), probably due to previous infections with cross\u2010 reactive HCoV strains over a longer life\u2010time. The binding antibodies that were detected in the ELISA, utilizing inactivated whole HCoV\u2010 229E, \u2010OC43, and \u2010NL63 viruses, were likely directed against more HCoV proteins than just the S protein compared to the neutralizing antibodies that are directed against epitopes of the S protein. The method of virus inactivation that was used may have preserved the integrity of virions and their antigenicity. We did not confirm that binding antibodies detected in the ELISA were directed against more than the S protein antigens. Only binding antibodies to the recombinant N protein could be measured in the case of \u2010HKU1. There were positive statistical correlations between binding antibody levels in both acute and convalescent sera within HCoV genera. There appeared to be closer correlations between binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent sera than acute illness sera particularly for HCoV\u2010NL63 and for \u2010OC43, respectively, and closer binding antibody correlations between strains within the Alphacoronavirus (HCoV\u2010229E and \u2010NL63) and between strains within the Betacoronavirus (HCoV\u2010OC43 and \u2010HKU1) genera.",
            "The preexisting serologic status against various strains of coronavirus among patients undergoing acute infection during the serious current outbreak of COVID\u201019 virus and their immune responses to COVID\u201019 infection are not known. Patients with MERS\u2010CoV infections are seronegative at onset of illness and can develop both binding and potentially protective neutralizing antibodies that correlate in convalescent sera. Delayed serologic responses occur in those with more severe illness and higher viral shedding.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] In contradistinction, our HCoV\u2010experienced subjects were already seropositive for the four strains at onset of the RI. Increases in binding antibodies bracketing RI, signaling likely intercurrent HCoV infection, were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and viral nucleic acids detected in respiratory secretions, and more frequent in young compared to older adults. There were correlations between binding and neutralizing antibodies for homologous and for related HCoV strains, though not statistically significant for all comparisons. It is unlikely that there were simultaneous infections with more than one strain of HCoV, so concomitant increases in binding and neutralizing antibodies to more than one strain was consistent with stimulation of cross\u2010reactive antibodies and recall of immune memory. Susceptibility to repeated infections with HCoV may be explained in part by a stimulation of neutralizing antibodies in a minority of RI with increases in binding antibodies. Since binding antibodies increased more commonly than neutralizing antibodies, they may be a more sensitive seroepidemiological tool than neutralizing antibodies for identifying RI due to common HCoV strains."
