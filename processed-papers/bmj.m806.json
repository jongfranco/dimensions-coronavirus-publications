            "\u201cI expect there will be some onward transmission in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had it to date, as far as I can see, but that\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d",
            "Measures to mitigate the impact on the health service would \u201ccome with a social cost,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody knows that the kinds of things you consider are reducing mass gatherings and school closures\u2014which may or may not be appropriate for this particular virus, we don\u2019t know yet, we need to find that out. We\u2019re not saying we will adopt these measures, but we have to look at how likely are they to work, what the evidence base is, and what will be the social cost.\u201d",
            "He added, \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to, as a society, have a serious discussion about how we\u2019re going to manage trade-offs between school closures and changing the shape of the epidemic.\u201d",
            "Whitty said that any such measures were likely to need to be in place for two months or longer. \u201cThe implications of that aren\u2019t trivial, so we need to think carefully,\u201d he said.",
            "He emphasised that it was important to stress the things that \u201creally, really work\u201d in terms of limiting the spread of disease. \u201cBy far the biggest two are washing your hands, which people underestimate, and, if you cough and sneeze, putting your hand in front of it, hopefully with a handkerchief,\u201d he said.",
            "Whitty\u2019s comments came as the NHS announced that it is launching a service in west London offering \u201cdrive through\u201d coronavirus testing, in which people referred through NHS 111 are invited to an appointment in their car. Community nurses then carry out a swab in the nose and mouth, which are checked and assessed within 72 hours, and people are asked to self-isolate while checks are completed.",
            "The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) has also urged patients not to contact their GP for covid-19 \u201choliday cancellation\u201d letters, which some travel companies have requested. \u201cInsurers and travel companies should be basing their decisions to offer refunds on advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Public Health England, not letters from GPs,\u201d Martin Marshall, chair of the RCGP, said. \u201cIt is not a good use of GPs\u2019 time to be writing letters for patients who are not ill but have plans to travel.
