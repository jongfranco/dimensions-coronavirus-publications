One\nof the most important 2019-nCoV protein targets is the 3C-like protease for which the crystal\nstructure is known. Most of the immediate efforts are focused on drug repurposing of known\nclinically-approved drugs and virtual screening for the molecules available from chemical libraries\nthat may not work well. For example, the IC50 of lopinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, against the\n3C-like protease is approximately 50 micromolar. In an attempt to address this challenge, on\nJanuary 28th, 2020 Insilico Medicine decided to utilize a part of its generative chemistry pipeline\nto design novel drug-like inhibitors of 2019-nCoV and started generation on January 30th. It\nutilized three of its previously validated generative chemistry approaches: crystal-derived pocked-\nbased generator, homology modelling-based generation, and ligand-based generation. Novel\ndruglike compounds generated using these approaches are being published at\nwww.insilico.com/ncov-sprint/ and will be continuously updated. Several molecules will be\nsynthesized and tested using the internal resources; however, the team is seeking collaborations\nto synthesize, test, and, if needed, optimize the published molecules.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/div&gt;",
