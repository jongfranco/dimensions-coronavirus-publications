            "Faced with such a grim situation, the Chinese government has taken a series of unprecedented rigorous measures. First, all the 31 provincial-level divisions in China mainland have launched the highest level of responding mechanism for major public health emergency. Second, Wuhan and other 12 cities in Hubei Province have consecutively shut down all outbound transportation channels and suspended public transportation. Third, the State Council announced that both the Spring Festival holiday and winter vacation will be extended. Fourth, two emergency makeshift hospitals (Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals) with a total capacity of 2600 beds were built and more than ten cabin hospitals were renovated with more than 10,000 beds in Wuhan. Fifth, more than 30,000 members from military and public hospitals have successively headed out to Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province.",
            "Although the number of confirmed cases is still increasing, the increasing rate has showed a downward trend from February 4, 2020 (eFigure 2). Despite Hubei Province, Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan and Anhui are the top five provinces with respect to the ranking order of confirmed cases. The increasing rates of confirmed cases in these provinces also showed a downward trend recently (eFigure 3). Using a real-time Bayesian estimation model and a reported serial interval of COVID-19 [3, 4], we computed time-dependent reproduction number, R(t), which is defined as the expected number of secondary cases that one primary case will generate during infectious disease transmission. As shown in Fig. 1, R(t) has showed a downward trend in Wuhan, Hubei Province, outside Hubei, and China from January 27, 2020, to February 10, 2020. The downward trend of R(t) indicates that the prevention and control measures may be effective, although long-term effects remain to be evaluated."
