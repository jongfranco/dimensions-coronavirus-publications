            "IFNs induce antiviral activity in many cell types.

            "In addition, although single Ig deficiencies on their own might not necessarily increase susceptibility to infection, combined influences of multiple deficiencies might modulate disease progression and be clinically relevant. Our findings demonstrate a possible immune linkage with increased frequency of RBLM, but more research is needed to determine how this information can be used in the management and treatment of RBLM patients.",
            "HSV-2 should be suspected in all cases of RBLM, given that HSV-2 is the most common cause. Recognition of RBLM will lead to earlier diagnoses, decreased hospital stays, less unnecessary testing, better clinical treatment, and improved outcomes. Whereas previous research and case reports have shown an association of RBLM with deficiencies in IgG1 and IgG3, our findings suggest that susceptibility to RBLM might also be caused by low serum immunoglobulin IgG2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Although some research has already suggested an immunologic pathology predisposing to recurrent HSV-2 viral meningitis, more research is needed to understand the complete underlying pathophysiology and determine how this information can be used to evaluate, manage, and improve outcomes for patients with RBLM.",
