            "After the 2003 SARS outbreak, it took 20 months from the release of the viral genome to get a vaccine ready for human trials. The zika virus took six months. Now, the NIH is pushing to have a vaccine ready for testing in three to six months. The race is on.",
            "The NIH team took the template for a SARS vaccine and swapped enough code from the new virus to start a new vaccine. Researchers, having experience with SARS, already knew which part of the virus to choose for the vaccine\u2019s antigen, a sort of red flag for the immune system. This synthetic antigen will prod the body to make antibodies.",

Spike glycoproteins stud the surface of the virus and bind to a receptor (ACE2) on human lung cells, analogous to a key for breaking in. Developing antibodies that will bind to the spike protein is one way to stop the virus invading human cells.",

Inovio, in Pennsylvania, received a $9m grant from CEPI and announced plans to test its DNA vaccine in China. In 2019, Inovio announced positive results from its firstin-man trial of a DNA vaccine against the MERS coronavirus. This is a DNA plasmid vaccine that expresses the spike glycoprotein from MERS virus. The plasmid transits into a recipient\u2019s cells after they are hit by a short electric buzz via a specialised medical device. The vaccine for the Wuhan virus will take a similar approach.",
            "\u2018The advantage of the mRNA and the DNA approach is that you can move quickly into design and manufacture,\u2019 says Peter Hotez, a virologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. \u2018The disadvantage is that there has never been a licensed DNA or RNA vaccine.\u2019 Historically, these candidates have not transitioned well from mice studies to humans. Although the companies say they can overcome these hurdles, Hotez says authorities should not overlook older, established technology.",
            "His own group developed a SARS vaccine based on a small portion of the spike protein that binds to the host cell receptor. \u2018It does take time to scale up production, and it may need a cold chain,\u2019 he notes. He would like to test the efficacy of his SARS vaccine in patients with the Wuhan virus, and in parallel develop a similar recombinant vaccine against the novel virus itself. \u2018We are ready to go, but don\u2019t have the resources. Either someone in China or the NIH could help us accelerate this.\u2019",
            "Johnson & Johnson announced that it will use its adenovirus technology, a similar strategy to that used in its Ebola vaccine, currently deployed in Congo and Rwanda. The company said it could take eight to 12 months before this vaccine reaches clinical trials.",
            "CEPI is also supporting researchers at the University of Queensland, Australia, who will deploy a \u2018molecular clamp\u2019 strategy. This involves making viral surface proteins, which attach to cells during infection, clamping them into shape making it easier for the immune system to recognise the correct antigen. The approach has protected lab animals from flu and Ebola.",
            "\u2018It will be relatively easy to target the spike protein of a novel coronavirus,\u2019 notes Menachery. \u2018The barrier will be safety testing in humans.\u2019 This will be the slowest step too, he adds. \u2018I imagine you could see its use in people by the early summer,\u2019 adds Menachery. \u2018However, wide distribution usually requires more testing. Normally I\u2019d predict more than a year, but with the current outbreak, we may see more rapid response and implementation.\u2019",
            "A vaccine may only become available after the Wuhan virus has finished blazing around the world. \u2018You need three to six months to make and trial a vaccine,\u2019 says Meriadeg Le Gouil, a virologist at the University of Caen in Normandy, France, \u2018This virus is going to change a lot in that time.\u2019 Whether the vaccine will still be useful is uncertain, he adds. \u2018I\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t develop a vaccine. It is a necessity. But the impact of a vaccine in future is highly unpredictable.\u2019",

Epidemiological studies have linked prolonged lithium treatment to a reduced incidence of dementia, but clinical studies have offered conflicting results.",
            "In the new study, researchers in Canada gave a special formulation of lithium to older rats genetically altered to express mutated human proteins that cause Alzheimer\u2019s (J. Alzheimer\u2019s Dis., doi: 10.3233/JAD190862). The formulation consisted of lithium encapsulated in a water-in-oil emulsion designed to cross the blood brain barrier.",
            "The lithium formulation reduced disease symptoms and improved cognition in rats with advanced Alzheimer\u2019s-like disease, a time when amyloid plaques are present in the brain and cognition starts to decline.",

            "A previous study had shown that the same formulation reduced amyloid-related brain illness in threemonth old rats (Transl. Psychiatry, 2017, 7, e1190). Cuello stresses the rat they used is far superior to mouse models of Alzheimer\u2019s, since it has cognitive capabilities far higher and a condition much closer to human Alzheimer\u2019s.",
            "Psychiatrist Mark Good at Cardiff University warns, however, that one should \u2018remain cautious in speculating how well these findings might transfer to the clinic. GM animals are models of preclinical brain pathology based on rare early-onset genetic mutations and often combine mutations to drive pathology, which is not the case in the more prevalent, late-onset cases of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u2019",
            "\u2018Recent publicised data from clinical trials with aducanumab, suggest that targeting amyloid may be beneficial especially at the earliest stages of the disease,\u2019 adds Good. Drug interventions that reduce amyloid production and target other pathological pathways, such as oxidative stress and inflammation, should in theory offer improved outcomes for patients, he adds. \u2018Lithium may be one such approach.\u2019",
            "Cuello says big pharma has ignored lithium\u2019s potential because of the cost of clinical trials and difficulty in exerting IP rights to profit from treatments. Good agrees this is a potential barrier. \u2018This is a generic compound, so it is difficult to see whether a pharmaceutical company would be willing,\u2019 he states.",
            "A US-BASED RESEARCH TEAM at Northwestern University has discovered a new approach to conducting chemical reactions without requiring direct contact with a catalyst. This has been achieved using an intermediary created by a separate chemical reaction. The research builds on earlier work on the selective oxidation of cyclooctene using dissolved gold nanoclusters as the catalyst. Using their own Noncontact Catalysis System, the effectiveness of a gold catalyst was tested against ethylbenzene. Although ethylbenzene did not undergo any reaction in the presence of the gold clusters, the molecule formed when cyclooctene was reacted with the gold clusters produced the necessary intermediate to cause ethylbenzene oxidation. The researchers now plan to test whether the same approach works with other metals (Science Advances, doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aax6637).",

The design is part of a concept for developing safe all-solid-state batteries, eliminating the liquid or gel electrolyte between the two electrodes. The researchers developed a 3D nanoarchitecture in the form of a honeycomb array of hexagonal mixed ionic-electrode conductors (MIEC) tubes, partially infused with lithium metal as one electrode of the battery. There is space in each tube for the lithium to expand during the charging process. An electron and Li-ion insulator acts as a mechanical binder between the MIEC walls and the solid electrolyte.",
            "AUSTRALIAN RESEARCHERS have developed a non-flammable organic phosphate electrolyte for potassium and potassium-ion batteries that might be used for energy storage systems beyond lithium. The electrolyte is based on triethyl phosphate flame-retardant material. It has been tested in Li-ion batteries but only at high concentrations that provide sufficient stability for long-term operations, but generally too high for industrial applications that require dilute electrolytes. The concentrations could be reduced by using potassium ions. The researchers therefore combined the phosphate solvent with a potassium salt to obtain an non-flammable electrolyte that gave stable cycling at concentrations of 0.9 to 2M/L (scholars.ouw. edu.au/zaiping_guo)."

Overall sales of plant protection products also rose sharply, casting doubt on the French government\u2019s plans to halve agrochemical use by 2025.",
            "Part of the problem is a lack of alternatives to glyphosate, now owned by Bayer after it acquired Monsanto. The French government plans to publish a list of exceptions for glyphosate use this summer. However, it is also facing competition issues as the EU has re-authorised glyphosate for use until 2022.",

            "In a statement, the agriculture and food ministry attributed this partly to farmers buying in bulk before an increase in pollution charges on \u2018substances of greatest concern\u2019 came into force on 1 January 2019. Another factor is that farmers have replaced some toxic products with alternatives applied in larger quantities. According to ministry figures, there was a 20% increase in alternatives between 2017 and 2018. Julian Little of Bayer UK says it is ironic that farmers are being told on the one hand to reduce their carbon emissions and on the other to reduce glyphosate use. \u2018Glyphosate significantly reduces the need for ploughing so reducing carbon emissions. French farmers are using more glyphosate despite what the government is telling them. Such strange situations develop when politics interfere with the science around regulation.\u2019",

Introduced to North America from Europe around 150 years ago, the moth, Plutella xylostella, is highly damaging to crops such as oilseed rape, cabbage, and broccoli \u2013 especially in years where climatic and other factors cause its population to surge. A 2012 study reveals the species causes an estimated $4-5bn/ year in losses due to a combination of its high reproduction rate and resistance to insecticides.",
            "The study is the first in the world to release self-limiting agricultural insects into an open field and the researchers believe it highlights the potential for wider use of GE insects for pest control. \u2018Our research builds on the sterile insect technique for managing insects that was developed back in the 1950s and celebrated by Rachel Carson in her book, Silent Spring,\u2019 says Anthony Shelton, who led the work at Cornell University, US. \u2018Using genetic engineering is simply a more efficient method to get to the same end.\u2019",
            "The technology is similar to that employed to control Aedes aegypti mosquito populations in Brazil and works by releasing self-limiting male moths into the wild population. The GE diamond-back moth males, developed by Abingdon, UK based Oxitec, mate with wild females but the self-limiting gene passed to the offspring prevents female caterpillars from surviving. With repeat releases, the researchers claim that the moth population is suppressed in a targeted, ecologically sustainable way. After releases stop, the self-limiting insects decline and disappear from the environment within a few generations, depending on the population size.",

When the project started in 2015, livers could only be kept on the machine for 12 hours, but the new machine keeps them alive outside the body for a week and so should boost organ numbers available for transplantation. There is an urgent need for more donor livers due to an increasing gap between available grafts and patients awaiting an organ. \u2018Many livers are discarded because of poor quality. The availability of such a machine may contribute to a dramatic increase in the availability of liver grafts,\u2019 explains Pierre-Alain Clavien, a transplant surgeon at University Hospital Zurich.",
            "\u2018The next step will be to further test discarded livers and transplant a successfully rescued liver to a patient, for which this liver would be the only chance for a cure,\u2019 says Clavien. \u2018Since the machine is now ready for clinical use, such a procedure should be possible in the near future.\u2019",
            "It relies on a complex perfusion system, mimicking most core body functions, and overcomes five major hurdles: control of sugar metabolism, preventing damage to red blood cells, blood quality disruption, control of oxygen supply and simulating diaphragm movement.",
            "\u2018Keeping a liver healthy for 24 hours is generally good enough for transplants,\u2019 comments Friend, who was not involved in the Swiss project. \u2018Having seven days could allow you modify or repair the organ. We might improve the quality of the liver or modify it to make it better suited for transplant.\u2019",
            "Liver damage due to fat deposits is a common problem in donor livers, for example. If you could mobilise and remove that fat during the course of isolated perfusion, that would be extremely attractive, he notes.",
            "Meanwhile, other applications for keeping livers alive for a week or more also include for toxicology testing for new drugs in development."

        "Cool mobile phones": [
            "Chinese researchers have devised a way to prevent electronic devices, such as mobile phones, from overheating. It involves a coating that releases water vapour and allows heat to dissipate.",
            "While fans can cool larger devices such as computers, manufacturers tend to use phase change materials, such as waxes and fatty acids, for cooling phones. When they melt, these materials absorb heat produced by the devices. However, the total amount of energy exchanged during this solidliquid transition is relatively low.",
            "Ruzhu Wang and his colleagues at Shanghai Jiao Tong University have been working with metal organic frameworks (MOFs), a group of porous materials that can absorb moisture from the air and release water vapour when heated. MOFs can hold a large amount of water, allowing them to take away more heat when temperatures rise.",
            "\u2018Previously, researchers have tried to use MOFs to extract water from desert air,\u2019 Wang says. \u2018But MOFs are still really expensive, so largescale applications aren\u2019t really practical. Our study shows electronics cooling is a good real-life application of MOFs. We used less than 0.3g of material in our experiment, and the cooling effect was significant.\u2019",
            "The team selected a MOF called MIL-101(Cr) to coat three 16cm2 aluminium sheets of different thicknesses and heated them on a hot plate. The coating delayed the temperature rise of the sheets (J. Joule, https://doi. org/10.1016/j.joule.2019.12.005). While an uncoated sheet reached 60\u00b0C after 5.2 min, it took the sheet with the thinnest coating 11.7 min to reach the same temperature and the one with the thickest coating 19.35 min of heating.",
            "\u2018In addition to effective cooling, MIL-101(Cr) can quickly recover by absorbing moisture again once the heat source is removed, just like how mammals rehydrate and are ready to sweat again,\u2019 Wang says. \u2018So, this method is really suitable for devices that aren\u2019t running all the time, like phones, charging batteries and telecommunications base stations, which can get overloaded.\u2019 However, David Farrusseng of the CNRS Institute of Research on Catalysis in Lyon says while it may be the first time that MOFs have been used like this, silica or some zeolites, which are cheaper, could do the same job. \u2018The MOF technology is not actually the point. While the idea looks great, the gain appears limited, plus [there are] additional constraints in monitoring chip temperature.\u2019 He concludes the approach is probably not appropriate for cooling chips in data devices."

        "Surprise jump in GG emissions": [
            "Emissions of the potent greenhouse gas HFC23 have been rising at record levels, according to new research. The findings seem to contradict claims by India and China that they had almost eliminated HFC-23 emissions.",
            "The extra emissions are roughly on par with the total greenhouse gas emissions of Spain in 2017. This is because HFC-23 has an atmospheric lifetime of around 228 years and exerts a strong greenhouse effect: 1t of HFC-23 exerts the same global warming effect as over 12,000t of CO2.",
            "Both China and India announced in 2015 ambitious plans to cut HFC-23 emissions from factories that produce the gas. This led scientists to expect emissions to drop by around 90% between 2015 and 2017. An international team of scientists report that, instead, around 16Gt of HFC-23 were released into the atmosphere, more than at any time during history (Nature Commun., 2020, 11, 397).",
            "\u2018The rate of growth in atmospheric concentrations seems to have accelerated. Growth during the years 2017 and 2018 were the highest in our atmospheric records,\u2019 says Matt Rigby, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Bristol and report author.",
            "HFC-23 is mainly generated as an unwanted byproduct during the manufacture of the refrigerant HCFC-22, via the overfluorination of chloroform. The byproduct can either be treated, by incineration, or vented to the atmosphere.",
            "China is assumed to be the biggest emitter, accounting for around 75% of global production of HCFC-22, with India at around 10%. \u2018The Chinese government says reductions in HFC-23 emissions have happened, and producers say they are implementing abatement. We don\u2019t know where the error is, or what\u2019s gone wrong,\u2019 Rigby says.",
            "Rigby was part of an international group that also detected a surprising rise in atmospheric concentrations of CFC-11, reporting that eastern China accounted for 40 to 60% of the global rise in emissions (Nature, 2019, 569, 546-550).",
            "This was pinpointed from atmospheric measurements by South Korea and Japan. The discovery is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out CFC production by 2020.",
            "\u2018It seems likely that reported HFC-23 emission reductions during the manufacture of HCFC-22 have in reality not been achieved so far, or that there are additional unreported productions of HCFC-22. Or a combination of these,\u2019 comments Bj\u00f6rn-Martin Sinnhuber, an atmospheric chemist at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.",
            "He points to a recent report that ozone depleting substances may be responsible for about half of the Arctic warming in the 20th century (Nature Climate Change, 2020, 10, 130). \u2018We\u2019ve known for a long time that CFCs and other ozone depleting substances are efficient greenhouse gases, but the magnitude of this impact is surprising and not fully understood yet,\u2019 says Sinnhuber.",
            "HFCs were included in the Kigali amendment of the Montreal Protocol to ensure their emissions do not offset climate gains from the phase out of CFCs and HCFCs. \u2018We need some independent checks on what countries are reporting,\u2019 concludes Rigby."

The work paves the way for studies into the effectiveness of probiotics in PD, the second most prevalent neurological disorder.",
            "\u2018The results provide an opportunity to investigate how changing the bacteria that make up our gut microbiome affects Parkinson\u2019s\u2019, says Maria Doitsidou of the University of Edinburgh, UK, who led the work.",
            "The team at the universities of Edinburgh and Dundee found that the probiotic Bacillus subtilis strain PXN21 (B. subtilis) prevents the build-up of the protein \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) in roundworms (https://doi.org/10.1016/j. celrep.2019.12.078). In people with PD, \u03b1-syn builds up and aggregates into toxic clumps associated with the death of dopamine producing nerve cells. The loss of dopamine leads to the movement- and dementia-related symptoms seen in Parkinson\u2019s.",
            "The researchers isolated bacterial strains from a range of \u2018off the shelf\u2019 probiotic products and fed them one at a time to a strain of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans that produces human \u03b1-syn. They found that B. subtilis had a \u2018remarkable effect\u2019 on \u03b1-syn aggregation \u2013 preventing its build up in C. elegans and even reversing the formation of toxic clumps.",
            "\u2018The major pathways by which cells cope with protein misfolding and clear aggregated proteins are conserved between C. elegans and mammals. Because of this, it is very likely that principles that are discovered in the worms can translate to higher organisms\u2019, says Doitsidou. \u2018The next steps are to confirm these results in mice, followed by fast-tracked clinical trials since the probiotic we tested is already commercially available\u2019",
            "Beckie Port, Research Manager at Parkinson\u2019s UK, which co-funded the work commented: \u2018Studies that identify bacteria that are beneficial in Parkinson\u2019s have the potential to not only improve symptoms but could even protect people from developing the condition in the first place.\u2019",
            "Currently, Parkinson\u2019s patients don\u2019t routinely undergo gut microbiome screening. \u2018At the moment there is not sufficient information to evaluate what a specific microbial composition means for the progression of the condition,\u2019 Doitsidou says. \u2018However, as research progresses, it is conceivable that in the future microbiota screening may be predictive of the development of specific symptoms or inform the course of treatment.\u2019",
            "Commenting on the research, Guy Caldwell from the University of Alabama, US, says: \u2018[The researchers] provide an excellent example of applying the unique attributes of an animal model system, C. elegans, to uncover potentially disease-modifying factors produced by the common probiotic bacterium, B. subtilis... While the worm Parkinson\u2019s model is certainly popular, [it] suffers from limited success in translational outcomes that have resulted from its extensive use. This is possibly due the type of \u201caggregation\u201d that is quantified.\u2019"

            "Rome\u2019s Fiumicino airport is to test a new tarmac on one of its runways for a year. The material contains graphene and waste plastic and is claimed to have cost and environmental benefits.",
            "This follows trials of the new additive, Gipave, on roads in Oxfordshire, which started in November 2019, and forms a programme of tests designed for different weather conditions. Gipave has been developed by two Italian companies, the graphene producer Directa Plus and Iterchimica, which supplies additives for asphalt, together with A2A\u2019s recycling and waste management unit G.Eco and the University of Bicocca in Milan, which analysed its environmental impact. The graphene-enhanced \u2018super modifier\u2019 is the result of a three-year research programme, which filed a patent in 2017.",
            "To produce Gipave, graphene nanoplatelets and other additives are combined with a selected hard plastic, which is not normally recycled. A spokesperson for Iterchimica declined to name the plastic but said not all hard plastics were suitable for constructing asphalt pavements. Gipave granules are added directly to the asphalt plant mixer after the aggregates but before adding bitumen.",
            "The first commercial tests involved a 1km long section of a busy road in Rome. According to Iterchimica, after a year of testing, the material was found to last two-and-a-half times longer than a conventional asphalt road. The surface was more resistant to the passage of vehicles \u2013 indirect tensile strength increased by 35% and overheating from events such as collisions, speeding and braking. It was also 50% less likely to buckle at 40\u00b0C. In other tests, it was claimed that reducing the thickness of the asphalt layer by more than a tenth could maintain the service life of the surface, compared with conventional asphalt.",
            "However, the material costs 18-20% more than conventional asphalt. Federica Giannattasio, Chief Executive of Iterchimica, claims the material\u2019s advantages of longer life-span and lower maintenance costs outweigh the extra expense. The Gipave asphalt is also recycleable, meaning that it should help reduce the amount of new material extracted from quarries.",
            "However, there has been concern in the past about using plastics in road surfacing as they can contribute to cracking and may not be durable in the long-term. Iterchimica\u2019s spokesperson says the company has not found this to be the case in their experience, which may be because they use only a specially selected plastic, which is \u2018not added directly in the asphalt pavement but it is contained in the polymeric compound\u2019.",

In the shorter term, geopolitical and economic turmoil and cyberattacks also pose a threat.",
            "Speaking at the launch of the 2020 report, B\u00f8rge Brende, president of the WEF said: \u2018The political landscape is polarised, sea levels are rising, and climate fires are burning. This year leaders must work together with all sectors of society to mitigate the risks. The cost of inaction today far exceeds the cost of action. We have to implement the necessary policies now to deal with climate change.\u2019",
            "In the next 10 years, extreme weather events, climate action failure, biodiversity loss, natural and humanmade environmental disasters are the top five most likely risks. This contrasts with the risk landscape 14 years ago when economic and geopolitical factors, such as oil prices and Middle East instability, dominated. In addition, Mirek Dusek, a member of the WEF\u2019s executive, noted serious \u2018lingering\u2019 health risks, including the growth of drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to pandemics.",
            "The report finds human activity has already caused the loss of around 83% of all wild animals and 50% of plant species, which underpin our food and health systems. Peter Giger, Chief Risk Officer at Zurich Insurance Group, warned: \u2018Biologically diverse ecosystems capture vast amounts of carbon and provide massive economic benefits estimated at $3.3tn per year \u2013 the equivalent to the GDP of the US and China combined.\u2019 It\u2019s critical, he added, that companies and policymakers move faster to a low carbon economy and more sustainable business models.",
            "The report forecasts the years ahead will see increased domestic and international divisions, with looming trade wars and economic slowdown. Geopolitical turbulence, it finds, is propelling us towards an \u2018unsettled\u2019 unilateral world of great power rivalries at a time when global leaders must focus urgently on working together to tackle shared future risks.",

            "The European Commission has decided not to renew the approval of Bayer\u2019s pesticide thiacloprid, effectively banning the chemical from use in Europe.",
            "Thiacloprid is a neonicotinoid, a group of pesticides used since the 1990s. Sold under the brand names Calypso and Biscaya, it controls pollen beetles and aphids in crops such as oilseed rape, potatoes, peas, wheat and sugar beet.",
            "The decision follows scientific advice by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Companies and distributors can still sell the product up to August 2020 and farmers may use it until February 2021. \u2018There are environmental concerns related to the use of this pesticide, particularly its impact on groundwater, but also related to human health, in reproductive toxicity,\u2019 said Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides.",
            "In 2013, the Commission restricted use of three neonicotinoids approved in the EU on flowering crops such as oilseed rape, due to the dangers to bees. It then extended the ban on imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam in April 2018 for outdoor use on crops such as winter cereals and sugar beet. However, several EU member states have emergency exemptions. France has banned all four insecticides, including in greenhouses.",
            "Julian Little, a spokesperson for Bayer UK, says the news is disappointing as thiacloprid has a long history of safe use. \u2018It is becoming more difficult for farmers to control a number of insects, such as aphids, which have developed resistance to the pesticides that are left. Farmers are getting increasingly desperate, particularly as climate change brings less severe winters and more pests.\u2019 He anticipates, although it is not yet known, that the UK will follow the EU ruling now it has left the bloc.",
            "However, thiacloprid was originally classified as toxic to reproduction in 2015, according to Martin Dermine, Health and Environment Policy Officer at Pesticide Action Network Europe. \u2018We consider that the system is not working if it took almost five years for a ban to follow such a classification. But member states put pressure on the European Commission to delay, as this is the last in the neonicotinoids category to be regulated.\u2019 According to Dermine, there are less toxic alternatives as well as non-chemical approaches, such as using pheromone traps in orchards, long crop rotations of five to seven years, or planting hedges to encourage beneficial insects."

            "The rollback of the Obama era environmental protection measures continues in the US. The 2015 Waters of the US Rule (Wotus), aka the Clean Water Rule, has been repealed, with the wording that it replaced being, essentially, restored.",
            "Wotus defines which rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands fall under federal jurisdiction, allowing the federal government and its agencies to control what can be discharged into them. Obama\u2019s Clean Water Rule was initially suspended in 2018, after President Trump signed an executive order instructing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to repeal and replace it. Now, EPA and the Army Corps have introduced the Navigable Waters Protection Rule in its place.",
            "Wotus underpins the Clean Water Act. This Act dates back to 1972, and includes a multitude of regulations describing who can discharge what into those watercourses deemed \u2018waters of the US\u2019, whether pesticides from farming, industrial effluent or even sewage from a water treatment works. But the Act didn\u2019t define what constituted waters of the US.",
            "Some are obvious: big, navigable rivers such as the Mississippi and the Ohio, or large lakes such as Lake Michigan, clearly ought to be included. The arguments pile up at the smaller scale. What about tributaries? Or the 60% of US watercourses that are dry some of the year and fill up with rain or snowmelt? The arguments even made it to the Supreme Court, with a split decision in 2006 leaving the issue no clearer \u2013 there was no consensus on whether it ought to encompass any wetlands that significantly affect the integrity of other waterways that are covered by Wotus, or should only include them if there was a continuous surface connection.",
            "The Obama rule set something closer to a proper definition for the first time. Rivers and streams that flowed into navigable rivers were automatically included, for example, as were ponds and wetlands if they were within 100 feet of a protected waterway, or inside its 100-year flood plain. Previously, all of these had to be considered individually. And that is now the case once more.",
            "Unsurprisingly, the 2015 Rule was heavily criticised by the farming lobby and industrial groups. They claimed it gave far too much federal control over their business. Likewise, Republicans thought it amounted to federal over-reach over something that individual states and local areas should be left to decide for themselves.",
            "EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler claims the new Navigable Waters Protection Rule will provide \u2018much needed\u2019 regulatory certainty and predictability for farmers, landowners and businesses to support the economy and accelerate critical infrastructure projects. \u2018After decades of landowners relying on expensive attorneys to determine what water on their land may or may not fall under federal regulations, our new Navigable Waters Protection Rule strikes the proper balance between Washington and the states in managing land and water resources while protecting our nation\u2019s navigable waters, and it does so within the authority Congress provided,\u2019 he said.",
            "The new definition identifies four categories of waters that fall under federal jurisdiction with the Clean Water Act: territorial seas and traditional navigable waters, like the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River; perennial and intermittent tributaries; certain lakes, ponds and impoundments; and wetlands adjacent to jurisdictional waters. However, it also states that various other waters are not subject to federal control, including features that only contain water in direct response to rainfall, plus",
            "The administration eliminated clean water protections to protect polluters instead of protecting people groundwater, most farm and roadside ditches, prior-converted cropland, farm and stock watering ponds, and waste treatment systems.",
            "The Obama rule had, however, been enacted in fewer than half of the states because of ongoing legal challenges, and it is inevitable that the replacement rule will become mired in the legal system, too. It will take several years of cases being heard \u2013 and appealed \u2013 in lower courts before any case could reach the Supreme Court.",
            "And the new definition has been slammed by environmental groups, such as the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), which has been heavily involved in the case. \u2018The administration eliminated clean water protections to protect polluters instead of protecting people,\u2019 says senior attorney Blan Holman, leader of SELC\u2019s Clean Water Defense Initiative. \u2018This rule is the culmination of an insider campaign to gut bipartisan protections that have safeguarded the nation\u2019s water for decades, and will endanger the health and environment of families and communities across the entire country.\u2019",
            "The new Rule has, however, been welcomed by the farming lobby. \u2018It achieves important regulatory oversight while allowing farmers to farm,\u2019 said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall.",
            "Despite EPA trumpeting that it had consulted widely, SELC claims that the \u2018overwhelming majority\u2019 of the comments received opposed the changes. And, it says, even EPA\u2019s own Science Advisory Board \u2013 predominantly Trump appointees \u2013 claim that it is inconsistent with established science.",
            "\u2018If allowed to stand, this bulldozing of clean water protections would be among this administration\u2019s dirtiest, most dangerous deeds,\u2019 Holman concludes. \u2018We plan to fight them with everything we have to protect our communities and clean water.\u2019"
