        "abstract": "The meaning of the word \u2018mutation\u2019 in the vernacular does not reflect the complexities of evolutionary theory. In science fiction, to \u2018mutate\u2019 is to undergo a significant transformation. Characters in Marvel Comics, for example, possess incredible new abilities due to mutation. In the entertainment industry, the dramatization of evolution to portray disease outbreaks is a common trope. In Michael Crichton\u2019s The Andromeda Strain, an extraterrestrial microorganism continuously \u2018mutates\u2019 to acquire new biological properties, including the ability to degrade plastic and escape containment. The exaggerated book The Hot Zone inspired the 1995 thriller film Outbreak, in which a fictional Ebola-like virus rapidly mutates into a highly infectious strain capable of aerosolized transmission. Given the accessibility and mass appeal of these works, it is unsurprising that, during a reallife outbreak, journalists and scientists are sometimes predisposed to draw upon these fictional views.",

            "Our media streams and scientific communications flooded with trepidation and misrepresentation of mutations surrounding the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, exemplify this attitude. Headlines featuring \u2018DNA sleuths\u2019 searching for \u2018dangerous mutations\u2019 in the new virus inculcate an expectation that the virus will inevitably mutate to become more deadly[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. News reports warning that mutating viruses may spread more rapidly evoke visions of a doomsday scenario in which public health efforts to control the epidemic are rendered futile[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].",
            "Unlike science fiction, however, the dramatization of virus mutation is not innocuous, and we need only look to other recent outbreaks to realize the extent to which overinterpreting the impact of mutation directly affects our health and safety. For example, a mutation in the Zika virus membrane region (prM-S139N) emerged in a viral lineage preceding the devastating epidemic in the Americas. Both in vitro and mouse studies suggested that this mutation enhanced neurovirulence[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Yet, before this finding could be confirmed, misinformation began to circulate that this mutation was the cause of congenital Zika syndrome, specifically microcephaly. When Zika was detected in India in 2018, these false claims motivated the Indian government to develop policies under the incorrect assumption that the emergent virus could not cause foetal harm, citing the absence of the \u2018microcephaly mutation\u2019 to defend their decisions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]."
