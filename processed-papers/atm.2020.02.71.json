Currently there is no effective anti-viral treatment or vaccine for 2019-nCoV (1). This is different to the cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. For tuberculosis, after a clinical diagnosis aided with imaging is made, anti-tuberculosis treatment can be initiated even without positive pathogenic diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis smear or culture. For cases of Covid-19, CT may show signs typical of viral pneumonia, and thus help the clinical diagnose. However, a shift from a suspected case designation to a clinically diagnosed Covid-19 case designation may not impact the clinical management.",

            "In conclusion, currently there is no specific targeted treatment or vaccine for Covid-19. The approach to this disease is to control the source of infection; use of personal protection and precaution to reduce the risk of transmission; and early isolation and supportive treatments for affected patients. The role of CT in Covid-19 patient\u2019s management course remains undefined and its application as a diagnostic tool may be unjustified among regions with low Covid-19 prevalence (low pre-CT test probability). In all cases, we need to keep patients\u2019 exposure to radiation as low as possible. Particularly, children should avoid CT examination as much as possible. Children are much more sensitive than adults to the induction of cancer by radiation (10,16), and ultrasound imaging can be an alternative to techniques associated with radiation (17,18). CXR can be the choice for imaging, particularly for serial monitoring, as demonstrated in the case report from USA (12). For CT examinations, low radiation dose mode and techniques to minimise the radiation dosage should always be applied (13,19). There may be no ideal solution to all the concerns, the approach offering the best benefit-risk ratio shall prevail."

            "According to current recommendation, in non-Wuhan/non-Hubei regions, persons with close contacts and suspicious exposure are advised to have a 14-day health observation period. Contact surveillance should be carried out for those who had exposed to accidental contact, low-level exposure to suspected or confirmed patients (1,2,4). Once they display any symptoms, especially fever, respiratory symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, or diarrhoea, they should seek medical attention immediately. Suspected cases are those with epidemiologic risk and with clinical features (1,2). Confirmed cases are diagnosed with pathogenic evidence of (I) positive for the 2019-nCoV by the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples; or (II) viral gene sequencing shows high homogeneity to the known 2019-nCoV in respiratory or blood samples.",
