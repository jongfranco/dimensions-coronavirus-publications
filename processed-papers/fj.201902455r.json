        "abstract": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes significant economic losses in swine industry. Current studies on TGEV internalization mainly focus on viral receptors, but the internalization mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we used single-virus tracking to obtain the detailed insights into the dynamic events of the TGEV internalization and depict the whole sequential process. We observed that TGEVs could be internalized through clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and the internalization of TGEVs was almost completed within ~2 minutes after TGEVs attached to the cell membrane. Furthermore, the interactions of TGEVs with actin and dynamin 2 in real time during the TGEV internalization were visualized. To our knowledge, this is the first report that single-virus tracking technique is used to visualize the entire dynamic process of the TGEV internalization: before the TGEV internalization, with the assistance of actin, clathrin, and caveolin 1 would gather around the virus to form the vesicle containing the TGEV, and after ~60 seconds, dynamin 2 would be recruited to promote membrane fission. These results demonstrate that TGEVs enter ST cells via clathrin- and caveolaemediated endocytic, actin-dependent, and dynamin 2-dependent pathways.",

According to the previous study, it was reported that the TGEV internalization reduced in the porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells treated with shRNAs that targeting clathrin or caveolin; and the TGEVs could be clearly co-localized with endocytic transferrin and cholera toxin beta subunit.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] Therefore, our conclusion obtained from single-virus tracking that the TGEVs utilized clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis for the internalization is in agreement with the previous studies."

            "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes significant economic losses in swine industry. Current studies on TGEV internalization mainly focus on viral receptors, but the internalization mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we used single-virus tracking to obtain the detailed insights into the dynamic events of the TGEV internalization and depict the whole sequential process. We observed that TGEVs could be internalized through clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and the internalization of TGEVs was almost completed within ~2 minutes after TGEVs attached to the cell membrane. Furthermore, the interactions of TGEVs with actin and dynamin 2 in real time during the TGEV internalization were visualized. To our knowledge, this is the first report that single-virus tracking technique is used to visualize the entire dynamic process of the TGEV internalization: before the TGEV internalization, with the assistance of actin, clathrin, and caveolin 1 would gather around the virus to form the vesicle containing the TGEV, and after ~60 seconds, dynamin 2 would be recruited to promote membrane fission. These results demonstrate that TGEVs enter ST cells via clathrin- and caveolaemediated endocytic, actin-dependent, and dynamin 2-dependent pathways.",

According to the statistical analysis on the fluorescence intensities of individual DiD-labeled TGEVs in Figure 1C, it is found that DiD was evenly labeled on the TGEVs.

Untreated ST cells infected with the same amount of TGEVs were used",
            "To further investigate the dynamic TGEV internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, single-virus tracking was adopted using the fluorescence confocal microscope (Nikon A1, Tokyo, Japan). The TGEVs were labeled with DiD, and a fusion protein of clathrin light chain B and enhanced green fluorescent protein (Clc-EGFP) was expressed in the ST cells to observe the clathrin-coated structures (CCSs), which were generated by recruiting clathrin from cytoplasm on the cell membrane. Figure 2C depicts the typical dynamic motions of three individual TGEVs internalizing into the ST cells. All these time-lapse images show that the TGEVs first moved slowly in local regions; afterward, they significantly accelerated and moved rapidly through large distances. Moreover, there was no clathrin around the TGEVs in the beginning, then the clathrin gradually appeared with the TGEVs, and finally the clathrin around the TGEVs disappeared. Furthermore, we define entry as the time point at which the particle velocity of TGEV begins to increase, that is, the virus leaves the cell membrane and enters the cell. Analyzed from 38 TGEVs entries via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the statistical results show that the time duration from the beginning of recruitment of Clc to TGEV entry is 86.42 \u00b1 17.30 seconds. Meanwhile, according to Figures 2C and S2A, the TGEV internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis could be completed within 2 minutes of warm-up. In order to analyze these dynamic motions in details, both the TGEV velocities and the clathrin fluorescence intensities were extracted as shown in Figure 2D. The TGEVs moved slowly with the velocities of 0.076/0.079/0.108 \u03bcm/s, and their velocities rapidly increased to 0.907/0.952/0.912 \u03bcm/s. In addition, the clathrin fluorescence signals gradually increased and then nearly plateaued when the TGEV velocities were low, indicating the generation and the gradual maturation of the clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). The subsequent drastic decline and the eventual disappearance of the clathrin fluorescence signals occurred with the TGEV acceleration, demonstrating that the TGEVs were successfully encapsulated into clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and internalized into the ST cells, followed by the rapid uncoating of the CCVs only within a few seconds. By analyzing the TGEV velocities and the clathrin fluorescence signals, the TGEV motions can be separated into two stages as shown in Figure 2E. Additionally, the TGEV motions were also studied using mean square displacement (MSD). It is found that the TGEVs first experienced anomalous diffusion during the assembly of CCPs on the cell membrane (Figure 2F); and then the rapid motions of TGEVs were in directed diffusion (Figure 2G), suggesting that the TGEVs were successfully internalized into the ST cells. Both the results in Figure 2E-G illustrate that the TGEVs first recruited clathrin to form vesicles-containing viruses and then entered into the ST cells.",

In addition, single-virus tracking reveals that the TGEVs were first attached to the cell membrane and recruited clathrin to form the CCSs; after the CCSs containing TGEVs matured, the TGEVs were successfully internalized into the ST cells, and the CCSs finally disappeared. However, inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis did not completely block the TGEV internalization, indicating that there are still other infection pathways for TGEVs.",

It is found that nystatin significantly inhibited the TGEV internalization compared to the control group. Furthermore, to quantify the nystatin effect on TGEV infection, ST cells were treated with different nystatin concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 50 \u03bcM, and infected with the same amount of TGEVs. The relative TGEV levels measured by qPCR in Figure 3B illustrate that the",

Cholera toxin beta subunit (CTB) uptake assays indicated that nystatin and M\u03b2CD successfully inhibited the caveolae-mediated endocytosis (Figure S1D). In addition, the co-localization experiments showed that the TGEV particles were markedly co-localized with Cav[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] (Figure S1E,G), suggesting that caveolae-mediated endocytosis is important for TGEV internalization. These results further prove that the TGEV internalization also depends on caveolae-mediated endocytosis.",

Figure 3C depicts the typical dynamics of three TGEVs internalizing into the ST cells. Furthermore, results of 17 TGEV entries via caveolae-mediated endocytosis show that the average duration from the beginning of recruitment of Cav[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] to TGEV entry is 88.56 \u00b1 19.31 seconds, and according to Figures 3C and S2B, the TGEV internalization via caveolae-mediated endocytosis could be finished within 2 minutes of warm-up. Figure 3D shows the TGEV velocities and the caveolae fluorescence signals extracted from Figure 3C. Similar to the case of TGEV internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the TGEV velocities were rather low as 0.078/0.065/0.079 \u03bcm/s at first but significantly accelerated to 0.937/0.932/0.913 \u03bcm/s after 96/75/111 seconds. Moreover, according to the fluorescence signals, caveolae gradually increased and then maintained stable in the low TGEV velocity stage, but finally disappeared after the TGEVs reached fast velocities. Therefore, the TGEV internalization via caveolae-mediated endocytosis can also be separated into two stages shown in Figure 3E as the trajectories and Figure 3F,G as the MSD. In the first stage, the TGEVs were attached to the cell membrane with rather low speed in anomalous motion mode accompanied with the generation and the gradual maturation of caveolae; while in the second stage, these TGEVs successfully entered into the ST cells with accelerated velocities in directed motion mode but with the disappearance of caveolae.",

The DiDlabeled TGEVs were tracked in co-transfected ST cells. Figure 4A depicts a typical dynamic motion of an internalized TGEV via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in cotransfected ST cells. The time-lapse images show that the TGEV first moved slowly in local regions; afterward, the TGEV significantly accelerated and moved rapidly through large distances. Moreover, there was no clathrin around the TGEV in the beginning, then the clathrin gradually appeared with the TGEV, and finally the clathrin around the TGEVs disappeared, but there was no Cav[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] around the TGEV all along. Similarly, Figure 4B depicts a typical dynamic motion of an internalized TGEV via caveolae-mediated endocytosis in co-transfected ST cells. The time-lapse images show that the TGEV first moved slowly in local regions; afterward, the TGEV significantly accelerated and moved rapidly through large distances. Moreover, there was no Cav[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] around the TGEV in the beginning, then the Cav[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] gradually appeared with the TGEV, and finally the Cav[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] around the TGEVs disappeared, but there was no clathrin around the TGEV all along. In addition, we observed 61 successfully internalized TGEVs in 20 co-transfected ST cells, of which 37 were internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and 24 via caveolae-mediated endocytosis. According to the pie chart, about 60.7% of TGEVs could be internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and 39.3% of TGEVs could be internalized via caveolae-mediated endocytosis (Figure 4C).",
            "Besides the TGEV internalization via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, the function of endocytosisrelated proteins on virus internalization was also studied. Actin was proved as an essential element of endocytosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] Moreover, it is reported that TGEV infection can stimulate actin gather around the cell membrane,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] but it is still unclear whether the accumulation of actin is directly involved in the TGEV internalization. To further confirm the actin function, CytoD as an actin monomer-sequestering inhibitor was used in IFA.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] ST cells were treated with 1 \u03bcM CytoD and then infected with TGEVs.

            "in Figure 5A,B further prove that actin is involved in the TGEV internalization.",
            "Single-virus tracking was also implemented to investigate the dynamic TGEV-actin interactions by tracking individual DiD-labeled TGEVs internalizing into the ST cells expressing actin-EGFP as shown in Figure 5C. Additionally, Figure 5D shows the TGEV velocities and the actin fluorescence signals extracted from Figure 5C. Actin around the TGEVs gradually increased and maintained with rather high levels when the TGEVs performed rather low velocities as 0.067/0.105/0.099 \u03bcm/s; after 114/81/63 seconds, actin around the TGEVs rapidly decreased as TGEVs accelerated to 0.913/0.931/0.956 \u03bcm/s, both synchronizing with the TGEV internalization via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, it is speculated that actin could assist clathrin and caveolae endocytic pathways to promote the TGEV internalization. Similar to the conditions of TGEV internalization via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, the TGEV motions could also be divided into two stages shown in Figure 5E as the trajectories and Figure 5F and G as the MSD. The first stage describes the attached TGEVs recruited actin with low velocities in anomalous diffusion mode; and the second stage shows the TGEVs successfully entered into the ST cells with high velocities in directed diffusion mode.",

The results prove that actin can assist clathrin and caveolae endocytic pathways to promote the TGEV internalization from the beginning of the TGEV internalization.",

Moreover, the effects of different dynasore concentrations of 10, 50, 100, 500 \u03bcM on TGEV infection were also analyzed using qPCR as shown in Figure 6B, indicating that the relative TGEV levels decreased with higher dynasore concentrations. Both results prove that dynamin is involved in the TGEV internalization.",

First, three shRNAs targeting the open reading frame (ORF) of Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] were selected; then, shRNAs were transfected into the ST cells, and finally, the reduction of Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] expression was quantified by immunoblotting with antibody directed against the Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].

Moreover, using a qPCR assay, the TGEV infectivity of the ST cells transfected with sh-3 was reduced to about 50% as shown in Figure 6D. In addition, we also investigated the effect of the Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] dominant negative mutant Dyn2K44A, which can decrease the GTPase activity thus resulting in reduced endocytosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] The TGEV infectivity was significantly reduced in the ST cells transfected with the Dyn2K44A vector compared to those ST cells transfected with wild-type Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] (Dyn2WT) in Figure 6D. All the results in Figure 6A-D prove that Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] is essential for the TGEV internalization.",

Additionally, the corresponding TGEV velocities and the Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] fluorescence signals were extracted in Figure 6F. At ~30 seconds before TGEV acceleration, the Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] fluorescence signals just began to increase, and then rapidly reduced when the TGEV velocities rapidly increased.

Merely in internalization, viruses make use of a repertoire of cellular processes that involve hundreds of cellular proteins.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] In this work, we investigated the TGEV internalization in real time using single-virus tracking, which could observe and analyze the mechanistic and kinetic events during TGEV internalization.",
            "Based on electron microscope, previous study suggested that the TGEVs entered the host cells by endocytosis. Unfortunately, it is still unknown whether the TGEV endocytosis relies on clathrin dependent or independent pathway; however, the observed thickening of the membrane below some attached TGEVs in many cases indicated the involvement of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Using single-virus tracking, we observed that the TGEVs entered the ST cells via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and the entire TGEV internalization could be completed within ~2 minutes as shown in Figure 7B and S2. In addition, the endocytic pathway inhibitors CPZ, pitstop 2, nystatin, and M\u03b2CD significantly reduced TGEV internalization, further illustrating that the TGEVs could enter the ST cells via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. According to the previous study, it was reported that the TGEV internalization reduced in the porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells treated with shRNAs that targeting clathrin or caveolin; and the TGEVs could be clearly co-localized with endocytic transferrin and cholera toxin beta subunit.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] Therefore, our conclusion obtained from single-virus tracking that the TGEVs utilized clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis for the internalization is in agreement with the previous studies.",
            "In the past decades, it has been proved that many viruses can be internalized via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis by different methods. By using specific inhibitors, RNA interference, and dominant negative mutants, it has been indicated that hepatitis C virus, African swine fever virus, hepatitis E virus, and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus enter their host cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] while grass carp reovirus and porcine sapelovirus enter their host cells via caveolae-mediated endocytosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] In addition to these conventional methods, single-virus tracking provides many new insights into the study of the virus endocytic mechanism. Using this method, it has been successfully revealed the dynamic process of internalization of many viruses as influenza virus, dengue virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] By comparing our data with those obtained on other viruses mentioned above, we found that the dynamic of TGEV internalization is consistent with these viruses. These viruses first move slowly in local regions; afterward, they significantly accelerate and move rapidly through large distances. In addition, the internalizations of these viruses all experience two diffusion modes, first anomalous diffusion mode and then directed diffusion mode.",
            "Increasing evidences from different cell types reveal that actin plays an active and critical role during endocytosis. It was reported that actin was required for clathrin-coated vesicle formation, and membrane tension determined the actin dependence of clathrin-coated assembly.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>] Moreover, using single-virus tracking for vesicular stomatitis virus, it was proved that clathrin-coated vesicles depended upon the actin machinery during virus internalization.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Furthermore, caveolae-mediated endocytosis was proved to be dependent on the actin cytoskeleton, revealing that caveolae was dynamic structure that could be internalized into the cell, and the kinase activity regulated internalization relied on intact",
            "The role of dynamin in endocytosis is considered as scission factor that pinches off membrane invaginations.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] Numerous studies have shown that most viruses utilize the dynamin-dependent clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Simian virus 40 entered CV-1 cells via caveolae- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis, and human immunodeficiency virus entered TZM-bl cells via clathrinand dynamin-dependent endocytosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>] Using single-virus tracking, we found that the TGEVs started to recruit Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] often at 20 seconds before the TGEVs entered the ST cells as shown in Figure 7, suggesting that Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] had the function of pinching off the formed vesicles containing TGEVs from the cell membrane. Furthermore, the inhibition, RNA interference, and dominant negative mutant assays further prove the Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] function on the TGEV internalization in the late stage.",
            "To our best knowledge, it is the first time that TGEV internalization was directly observed using single-virus tracking. Moreover, the kinetics during TGEV internalization were analyzed in single-virus level as shown in Figure 8. After the",
            "TGEV attaches to the cell membrane, the TGEV first recruits clathrin or Cav[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] to form CCV or caveolae with the assistance of actin. When the vesicle containing the TGEV matures, Dyn[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] is recruited in the late stage of TGEV internalization to induce membrane fission and pinch off the endocytic vesicle from the cell membrane. Finally, uncoating disassembles the endocytic proteins, and the nascent vesicle containing TGEV is released in the host cell. This direct visualization on TGEV internalization in ST cells provides insights into TGEV infection, and may help the development of inhibitors to block the TGEV internalization into ST cells for preventing and treating TGE."
