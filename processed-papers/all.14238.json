        "abstract": "Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed. Results: An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were communityacquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P < .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P < .001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P < .001). Conclusion: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.\nJin-jin Zhang and Xiang Dong contributed equally to this work. ",

Low prevalence of smokers and no allergic diseases despite of drug hypersensitivity and urticaria was self-reported by any patients, indicating that allergic diseases and smoking history may not be the susceptible factors for COVID-19. The positive correlation of blood eosinophil and lymphocyte counts suggests that eosinopenia along with lymphopenia may be a useful indicator for diagnosing COVID-19 in those patients with typical symptoms and radiological changes. Larger sample population is needed to further investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and allergic diseases."

            "A novel member of human coronavirus, newly identified in Wuhan, China, recently, now officially named as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is a new strain of RNA viruses that has not been previously identified in humans. Studies have shown that the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, recently named as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) by World Health Organization (WHO), could induce symptoms including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and lymphopenia in infected patients. In more severe cases, infections causing viral pneumonia may lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and even death.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Since the first report of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the outbreak of the disease is currently continuously evolving. Until February 16, 2020, the locations with confirmed SARSCoV-2 cases include 25 countries. Globally, 73 332 cases were confirmed, including 72 528 cases in China and 804 cases outside of China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] A total of 1870 patients have died from this viral infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]",
            "It was established that the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree. By examining the full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2, it was discovered that this novel virus shared 87.99% identity sequencing with the bat SARSlike coronavirus,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] and it shared ~80% identity nucleotide with the original SARS epidemic virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Based on the preliminary information of this novel virus, it is considered that SARS-CoV-2 is the third zoonotic human coronavirus of the century.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] In addition, clinical evidences have suggested that this virus is transmissible from person to person.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Currently, it is still unclear about the origins and possible intermediate animal vectors of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the mechanism of this virus, that is, spreading between persons."

No 7 Hospital of Wuhan is one of the designated hospitals for the hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and has been entrusted by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University since January 2020. The pharyngeal swab specimens of these patients were collected and used for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Patients absent of or with negative SARSCoV-2 test results were excluded from this study. All patients involved in this study were living in Wuhan during the outbreak period of COVID-19.",
            "Demographic information, clinical characteristics (included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, surgery history, signs, and symptoms), chest computed tomographic (CT) scan or X-ray results, and laboratory findings of each patient were obtained from the electronic medical record system of No 7 Hospital of Wuhan and analyzed by three independent researchers. The access was granted by the director of the hospital. Patients with smoking history, COPD, and allergic diseases (including asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria) were identified. For patients with smoking history, the amount of smoking, the years of smoking history, and the years of smoking cessation were individually collected. This study was approved by the institutional ethics board of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No 2020028).",

            "|       3 was defined as the day when any symptoms were noticed by the patients. Severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the diagnostic and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 issued by Chinese National Health Committee (version 3-5). Severe COVID-19 was designated when the patients had one of the following criteria: (a) respiratory distress with respiratory frequency \u226530/min; (b) pulse oximeter oxygen saturation \u226493% at rest; and (c) oxygenation index (artery partial pressure of oxygen/inspired oxygen fraction, PaO2/ FiO2) \u2264 300 mm Hg.",
            "Patient pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for the SARSCoV-2 viral nucleic acid detection using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The viral nucleic acid testing for all patients was performed by the clinical laboratory from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, which is the designated laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 test for patients in No 7 Hospital of Wuhan. Detailed protocol was described somewhere else.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]",

            "A total of 140 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were included in this study, with 82 patients categorized into nonsevere patients and 58 severe cases on admission. The median age for all patients was 57 years, ranging from 25 to 87 years old, and the majority (70%) of them were more than 50 years old. About half (50.7%) of patients were male. Since no patients had direct exposure history of Huanan wet markets or wildlife animals, we presumed all patients in this study were community-infected cases. The SARSCoV-2 clustered within 15 (10.7%) patients in this study, whose family members or friends were also infected with SARS-CoV-2. Three hospital workers were infected. Ninety (64.3%) patients had at least one underlying comorbidity, the most common of which were chronic diseases, such as hypertension (30%) and diabetes (12.1%). Only two COPD patients were identified. Sixteen patients had self-reported medical history of drug hypersensitivity, and drug types include penicillin, cephalosporins, and specific Chinese traditional medicines. Two patients reported chronic urticaria. No self-reported other allergic diseases (including asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and other type 2 allergic diseases) were declared. Thirty-eight (27.1%) patients had surgery experience(s), such as C-section, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy. Interestingly, there were only 2 current smokers and 7 past smokers (Table 1).",

Although no significant correlations between the two cell types could be determined for the severe patients on the first day after hospital admission (r = .250, P = .066), this may be due to the extremely low values of eosinophils for the severe patients on that day."

            "No asthmatic patient was identified in this report, and only a few patients had self-reported drug hypersensitivity and urticaria. Other allergies such as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy were not reported. Given the prevalence of asthma in China was 4.2%27 and allergic rhinitis in Wuhan was 9.7%28 in adults, asthma or allergy may not be the risk factor for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many previous studies have investigated the association between virus infection and asthma, showing that respiratory tract viral infections are associated with asthma exacerbations. About 62%-95% of children with acute wheezing episodes tested positive for respiratory viruses in both hospital and community settings; while the prevalence in adults was less, it was still in the range of 41%-78%.29 Rhinoviruses (RVs) were the most frequently detected type of virus at all ages, whose infection could lead to more severe and longer-lasting lower respiratory tract symptoms. Virus-induced wheezing in infancy was often associated with asthma development in children.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] In addition to RV, other respiratory tract viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses (IfVs), coronaviruses (CoVs), human metapneumoviruses (HMPVs), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenoviruses (AdVs), and bocaviruses (BoVs), had all been detected in subjects with asthma exacerbations.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Nevertheless, findings about the association between asthma and coronaviruses were much less. CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E transmitted primarily during winter had been linked to asthma exacerbations in children and adults.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] In a literature systemic review with 63 studies included, the pooled prevalence of CoV infection during asthma exacerbations was 8.4% (95% CI, 5.1%-13.6%), ranking below RV (42.1%, the highest), RSV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), enterovirus (EnV), and IfV, and followed by cytomegalovirus (CV), BoV, PIV, metapneumovirus (MpV), and AdV. In Asia, the five major viruses associated with asthma were RV, EnV, IfV, PIV, and RSV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] Reported respiratory infection rates for CoV in children were usually from <1% to 9%, which varied between subtypes. In case-control studies, CoV was not more frequently presented in wheezing children in comparison with controls. Overall, CoV seemed to have a minor, if any, contribution to acute asthma exacerbations, and CoV infections were frequently co-infected with other viruses.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] As for the other two types of CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which could cause severe respiratory disease in human, most established studies with animal models were found less relevant to asthma.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] Intriguingly, a prospective clinical birth cohort study demonstrated that the number of early respiratory episodes was related to the risk of later development of asthma, irrespective of the virus type (eg, RV, RSV, and CoV), which indicated the specific viral trigger may not be a risk factor.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]",
            "On the other hand, it is also worth thinking whether allergic diseases could affect respiratory virus infections. A multicenter prospective study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] examined the effects of the presence of atopy, which was defined as positive skin prick tests to one or more allergens, on the course of disease in children hospitalized with viral pneumonia. In that study, atopy was found in 21.4% patients, while it showed there was no effect of atopic sensitization on the severity of viral pneumonia in children. In addition, pollen, type 2 response, respiratory viruses, and the tissue milieu such as the type 2 or type 1 may all affect the development and severity of viral infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] Also, history of allergic diseases such as ever wheezing, atopic dermatitis, and food/drug allergy was associated with severe pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] Taken together, virus infections have been associated with acute exacerbation of asthma, and allergy may not be a risk factor for virus infection. It is plausible that this concept may also apply to SARS-CoV-2; however, having no asthma patients and no respiratory allergies does not support this concept at least in this series of 140 patients.",
            "Two (1.4%) patients had COPD in our report; the percentage is similar as that reported by Guan et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] (12/1099, 1.1%). In addition, only 9 (6.4%) patients had a history of smoking, and 7 of them were past smokers. It was reported that the prevalence of COPD in adults \u226540 years old was 13.7%,22 and 27.3% of adults in China were current cigarette smokers (data in 2018).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] The relationship between smoking and coronavirus infection is not clear, and the exact underlying causes of the lower incidence of COVID-19 in current smokers are still unknown. Previous study demonstrated that CoV was not frequently detected by RT-PCR in the exacerbation of COPD, as compared to other respiratory viruses such as RV, EnV, RSV, and IfV, indicating that coronavirus plays a minor role in the acute exacerbation of COPD.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Although our study found that COPD and smoking populations were less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in smokers may be more severe.",
            "Smokers and COPD patients are more susceptible to the infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A recent study found that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, had a higher expression in smokers and COPD patients than in nonsmokers. In addition, the expression of DPP4 was inversely correlated with lung function and diffusing capacity parameters.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]",
            "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is abundantly expressed in airway epithelial cells and was identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV, which plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-induced lung injury.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] ACE2 and other components of renin-angiotensin system are the core factors for the control of acute lung injury induced by SARS coronavirus. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that ACE2 expression was downregulated once the disease process has been initiated.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] Thus, ACE2 may have double effects on SARS-induced lung injury.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>] Initially, it acts as a receptor for the infection of SARS coronavirus, and then, its downregulation promotes lung injury. ACE2 was also identified as the receptor for the novel SARS-CoV-2.40 The role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of this new coronavirus-induced lung injury is still unknown. Therefore, further studies are required to examine the expression of ACE2 in airway epithelia from COPD patients and current smokers.",
            "No significant difference was identified between the severe (7 days) and nonsevere patients (8 days), regarding the median days from symptom onset to hospital admission. Almost all patients (91.7%) had fever at onset of symptoms, consistent with that reported by Huang[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and Wang,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] but much higher than that reported by Guan.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] However, in Guan's study,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] most patients (87.9%) developed fever during hospitalization. Therefore, fever was the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19. Cough was another common symptom in these patients. 75% patients in our report had cough; the number is similar as that reported by other studies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] The incidence of fatigue in this study was 75%, which is higher than that reported by Huang and Guan, but close to that reported by Wang. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms was 39.6% in our report, which is much higher than that reported by Huang and Guan, but similar as Wang's study. Radiologically, most common signs on CT scan were bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] This is consistent with what we observed in our report (Figures 1-3).

            "Lymphopenia was common in patients of our study (75.4%); this is consistent with other reports.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Noticeably, the percentages, but not absolute counts of lymphocytes, were lower in severe patients when compared to nonsevere patients. This may be due to the increased total numbers of leukocytes in severe patients.",
            "Interestingly, decreased eosinophil counts were also common in these patients (52.9%). No significant difference in the ratio of patients with decreased eosinophil counts between severe and nonsevere patients was identified. There was a positive correlation between eosinophil and lymphocytes numbers, especially for the second test during hospitalization. Therefore, decreased eosinophil count may be used as an indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected patients. In those patients with typical symptoms and radiological changes with and without lymphopenia, decreased eosinophils may be an important diagnostic clue.",
            "Other abnormal laboratory findings include increased level of serum CRP, SAA, PCT, D-dimer, and creatine kinase, indicating sustained inflammatory response and disturbed coagulation mechanism after infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, CRP, PCT, D-dimer concentration, and leukocyte counts were significantly higher in severe compared to nonsevere patients, which may represent more prominent inflammation in severe patients. Higher leukocyte count and PCT may also be due to secondary bacterial infection. More precautions should be taken in patients with high serum CK, which may be caused by direct effect of virus or indirect effect of hypoxia. In the present study, data in regard to the treatment and outcome of these patients were not finalized, since most of these patients are remaining hospitalized.",
            "In summary, the study established the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 140 community-infected COVID-19 patients, showing an approximately 1:1 female-male ratio. Low prevalence of smokers and no allergic diseases despite of drug hypersensitivity and urticaria was self-reported by any patients, indicating that allergic diseases and smoking history may not be the susceptible factors for COVID-19. The positive correlation of blood eosinophil and lymphocyte counts suggests that eosinopenia along with lymphopenia may be a useful indicator for diagnosing COVID-19 in those patients with typical symptoms and radiological changes. Larger sample population is needed to further investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and allergic diseases."
