            "As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) cases were confirmed outside China. We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe from affected areas in China via air travel. We consider travel restrictions in place, three reported cases in France, one in Germany. Estimated risk in Europe remains high. The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk. Importation from Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe.",
            "Starting December 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology were reported in the city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The infective pathogen was later identified as a novel coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. As at 26 January 2020, a total of 1,988 confirmed cases have been reported from China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The main affected area is in the province of Hubei, but as at 27 January 2020, confirmed cases have also been reported in 32 other provinces [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]."

            "Number of exported cases from China and Germany as the probability that Europe (France and Germany excluded) imports at least one travelrelated case from China, conditioned to the observation of three cases imported to France and one case in Germany. Details of the computation are provided in the Supplementary Material. We estimate the risk for a varying number of exported cases from China, cumulative in time, to account for likely detection delays or under-detection of travel-related cases. As before, we then provide a colour-coded map of Europe to report for each country the probability that a case imported to the continent arrives there, when coming from cities depicted in Figure 1, except Wuhan. For sensitivity, we also tested whether the risk changes due to the additional inclusion of Wuhan in the multi-source seeding.",
            "The exportation of 30 cases from Wuhan before the travel ban, as reported so far, was estimated to put Europe at 61% risk of importing at least one case. The risk was localised in Western European countries, with the highest risk estimated for the United Kingdom (UK; 39%), followed by France (24%), and Germany (15%) (Figure 2). In some countries, importations are likely to occur at multiple airports (e.g. Germany, Italy, Spain), whereas in others the risk is mostly concentrated in airports serving the capital city (e.g. London in the UK, and Paris in France).",
            "The probability that at least one case is imported to Europe except France and Germany, given the three imported cases reported in France and one case confirmed in Germany, is high (Figure 3). It is estimated to be more than 64% for the number of travelrelated exportations from China reported so far (41 travel-related and one confirmed case in Germany). The probability becomes larger than 80% if 60 cases are exported from China.",
            "In the event that one travel-related case is imported to Europe, the risk of importation is highest in the UK (25%) (Figure 4). Germany and France, which already have confirmed cases, rank second and third with a probability of 16% and 13% to receive another case, respectively. Italy (11%) and Spain (9.5%) rank as fourth and fifth in terms of risk. The risk is in general higher in more populated countries (Supplementary Figure S1). Also Eastern Europe and Northern Europe would be at risk of importing cases.",
            "In the UK and France, the airports serving the capital cities continue to contribute the largest likelihood of importing cases (London contributes to 83% of the risk, Paris contributes to 94% of the risk, respectively). The estimates account for the travel ban imposed in the province of Hubei. Including travel flows from Wuhan, to account for cases who may have flown before the travel ban and are not yet detected, does not alter the estimations (data not shown)."

            "The risk pattern of 2019-nCoV importation estimated for Europe varies considerably depending on the geographical extent of the affected areas in China. In particular, a larger area acting as seed of exportation that includes Shanghai and Beijing (two cities with larger number of travellers to more widespread areas in Europe) would likely result in a higher and more widespread risk for Europe.",
            "Our results are based on available data and estimates of the affected provinces in China and account for origin-destination travel fluxes from these provinces, as well as the travel ban enforced in the Hubei province.",

            "However, estimates are sensitive to different healthseeking behaviours that infected travellers may have, and to the active surveillance practices put in place in European countries. We did not provide estimates of the expected number of imported cases per country, as this depends on the number of travel-related exported cases from China, a variable that is still hard to assess at this early stage.",
