        "abstract": "On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with &gt; 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development. Diagnostic PCR protocols can be found at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/laboratory-diagnostics-for-novel-coronavirus.",

The RBD models were submitted for docking analysis to human ACE2 (PDB ID: 2AJF, chain B) using HADDOCK 2.2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>] with residues 24, 27, 31, 34, 37, 38, 41, 42, 45, 79, 82, 83, 90, 325, 329, 330, 353, and 354 of ACE2 specified as a binding domain as well as RBD residues 402, 426, 436, 441, 442, 472, 473, 475, 479, 484, 486, 487, 488, and 491 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>]. The complex with the lowest z-score was selected and the binding energy was calculated using the PDBePISA server [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>]. Electrostatics of the complexes were also determined using adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann solver (APBS) calculations and PyMol to show surface electrostatics for the docked RBD models and 2AJF [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>].

            "Family Coronaviridae (order Nidovirales) is comprised of the Coronavirinae and Torovirinae subfamilies of viruses. Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses with positive-sense RNA genomes ranging from 25.5 to ~32 kb in length. The spherical virus particles range from 70-120 nm in diameter with four structural proteins. The viral envelope is covered by characteristic spike-shaped glycoproteins (S) as well as the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins. The S protein mediates host cell attachment and entry. The helical nucleocapsid, comprised of the viral genome encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein (N), resides within the viral envelope. The 5\u2019 two-thirds of the coronavirus genome consists of the replicase complex (ORF1a and ORF1b) and codes for two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b. The viral replicasetranscriptase complex is made up of 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) encoded for by the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. Both polyproteins can be cleaved by the viral proteases PLpro (nsp3) and 3CLpro (nsp5). The non-structural proteins function in the formation of double-membrane vesicles derived from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and are the sites of viral replication and transcription [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Coronaviruses also encode a unique proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) function of nsp14 that reduces the accumulation of mutations in the RNA genome. The remainder of the genome is transcribed into a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. Five accessory proteins (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 and ORF8b) are also encoded; however, they are not required for replication but may play a role in pathogenesis. Remaining subgenomic RNAs encode for accessory proteins that have immunomodulatory properties or functions that remain unknown.",
            "Coronavirus animal reservoirs and incidental hosts Determining the animal reservoir and incidental hosts of a virus with evidence of zoonosis such as 2019nCoV is important for controlling spillover events and limiting human infections. Although the ecological reservoir for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV remain undefined, evidence of viral presence in a variety of animal species has been found. Serologic evidence and the isolation of viral genomic material for SARS-CoVrelated viruses have provided evidence for bats as the putative reservoir for SARS-CoV. While masked palm civets and raccoon dogs were involved in transmission to humans and initially considered potential reservoirs, they are now considered as incidental or spillover hosts [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>].

Lower similarity (77%) is observed between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV S-proteins. However, there may be sufficient conservation in the RBD (75%) to expect that 2019-nCoV can still bind to ACE2. As a comparator, MERS-CoV S, which binds to a different receptor (dipeptidyl peptidase 4), has only 37% similarity to SARS-CoV S. Alignment of the RBD regions (Figure 3B) shows that 2019-nCoV has 6 amino acid substitutions in the 14 contact points between SARSCoV S and ACE2 (Figure 3D).

Arg426 in the SARS-CoV RBD interacts with ACE2 residues Gln325 and Glu329. The structural model of 2019-nCoV RBD (Figure 4C) shows that the side chain of Gln426 is still in close proximity to ACE2 Gln325 and Glu329, suggesting that the substitution of Arg426 to Asn426 has little effect on receptor binding. Tyr484 to Gln484, introduces a polar amino acid within a region that includes several tyrosine residues. Within the SAR-CoV RBD, Tyr484 interacts with His34 of ACE2. The R-group of Gln should not inhibit receptor binding in this region, sterically or otherwise, when compared to the R-group of Tyr484. The third substitution unique to 2019-nCoV, Asn479 to Gln479, may induce a conformational change within the RBD due to its proximity to several tyrosines. However, a hydrogen bond is located in the area between RBD Gly488 and ACE2 Lys353 is conserved. This mutation is therefore unlikely to have any negative effect on ACE2 binding.",

            "Vaccines provide protection from viral pathogens prior to exposure by eliciting protective immune memory with an innocuous agent. The development of neutralizing antibodies from a vaccine remains one of the hallmarks of effective vaccines although vaccines",
            "All protein sequences used for tree generation were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and annotated by accession number. Protein sequences were then aligned using the ClustalW algorithm, and the tree was constructed with MEGA X by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method using 1,000 bootstraps. The solid black circle indicates the novel Wuhan pneumonia virus, and the solid black triangle indicates SARS coronavirus Shanghai and human coronaviruses HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43. The novel Wuhan coronavirus envelope protein shows high identity with Bat SARSlike coronavirus.",
            "that induce cell-mediated immunity have also shown potential and are in development for viral pathogens such as influenza viruses. Several vaccine platforms exist with the ability to induce protective responses: killed whole virus vaccines; split-virion vaccines; subunit vaccines; live-attenuated viral vaccines; viruslike particle vaccines; nanoparticle vaccines; and nucleic acid vaccines (DNA and RNA). In regard to choosing a vaccine target and platform, the vaccine candidate must be immunogenic and immune targeting must lead to virus neutralization or potent cytotoxic responses. To date, there is not a licenced vaccine for either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although clinical trials have been initiated for MERS-CoV vaccines. Much of the focus for the development of a SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV vaccine has been on the S protein since it is immunogenic and antibodies targeting it can neutralize the virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. Our analysis of the S protein (Figure 2) suggests that it has potential for vaccine development which can be related to work previously done for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",
            "The envelope protein (E) is also an attractive vaccine target that has been proposed for leverage in the development of live-attenuated vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>]. MERS-CoV mutants with the E protein deleted are replication-competent but propagation-defective [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>]. Similar results were shown for the SARS-CoV when E was removed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>]. Together this suggests that deletion of E from coronaviruses may provide a safe-single replication live viral vaccine for use in inducing a mucosal immune response. We investigated the similarity of the E protein of 2019-nCoV by phylogenetic analysis against known coronavirus E protein sequences (Figure 6) and found clustering, although somewhat distant, with human SARS-CoV. Given that vaccines have been generated for MERSand SARS-CoVs by mutating the E protein, an E-based vaccine may represent an alternate candidate for 2019nCoV vaccines. As vaccine candidates are identified, the requirement of animal models for vaccine development and evaluation will be essential.",
            "Animal model development Establishing an animal model of infection and disease pathogenesis is imperative for understanding several essential elements of viral disease in the infected host, including host tropism, immune responses, and modes of transmission, as well as for the progression of therapeutic development. Having an animal model that can recapitulate human disease is essential for vaccine and therapeutic development as well as testing. For a potential animal model to be susceptible to infection, the virus must be able to 1.) gain entry into host cells; 2.) overcome the host\u2019s antiviral responses; and 3.) disseminate virus following infection to allow infection of other neighbouring cells and tissues. It is also of importance for the model to be able to recapitulate human disease and viral transmission modes. When evaluating the ability of an animal to be infected by a virus and serve as a model, viral shedding, clinical disease, and seroconversion should be determined. The past animal models for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not universal due to the expression of the virus-specific cellular receptors for entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>]. As SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not share a cellular receptor, they do not share the same host range and susceptibility, which includes research animal models [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>]. Cynomolgus macaques, ferrets, and cats were some of the first animals to be determined susceptible to SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>]. The advantage of ferrets is that they are a smaller animal compared to non-human primates and also are able to recapitulate some of the clinical symptoms and transmission kinetics of human respiratory viruses including coughing, sneezing, fever, and weight loss [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>]. Although mice can be infected with SARS-CoV, as shown by recovery of vRNA and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, infection does not cause severe disease[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c68\" href=\"#r68\">68</a>]. However, SARS-CoV could be passaged in mice (15 times) for the establishment of a model with clinical features[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>]. After the identification of MERSCoV, it was quickly determined that typical research animal models were not susceptible to the virus including mice, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets. Larger non-human primate models, such as Rhesus macaques and common marmoset were determined susceptible. To make use of small animal models, transgenic mice have been engineered for MERS-CoV susceptibility through expression of the human DPP4 receptor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>]. Other attempts at other mouse model developments were not successful, including an immunocompromised 129/SATA1-/-1 mouse [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>]. Having an understanding of the animal models and model development previously utilized for the other coronaviruses of interest will aid in the development of a model for 2019nCoV. As is necessary, elucidation of the receptor will help guide in development, and creating a clinical picture of the acute symptoms in humans will be essential for vaccine and antiviral evaluation.",
            "Community Readiness Community and healthcare preparedness in response to coronavirus outbreaks remain ongoing obstacles for global public health. For example, delays between disease development and progression and diagnosis or quarantine can severely impact both patient management and containment [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>]. Deficiencies in outbreak preparedness and healthcare network coordination efforts must ultimately be considered in response efforts. It is strongly recommended that universal reagents be maintained and available at global repositories for future outbreaks.",
            "Future Directions At the time of this writing, cases continue to be reported. Furthermore, there are also many unknowns regarding this outbreak, including the reservoir host, modes of transmission/transmission potential, and the effectiveness of potential vaccine candidates. Here we have attempted to address some of these issues using foundations from previous coronavirus outbreaks as well as our own analysis. What is certain is that the numbers of reported cases are increasing and will continue to increase before the knowledge gaps surrounding 2019-nCoV are filled. Cooperation among public health officials, healthcare workers, and scientists will be key to gaining a foothold and containing virus spread. Acknowledgement of coronaviruses as a constant spillover threat is important for pandemic preparedness. Two key take-away messages are important at this time: 1) As noted by the previous lopsided cases of healthcare, healthcare workers and care givers should exercise extreme caution and use personal protective equipment (PPE) in providing care to 2019-nCoV infected patients; and 2) The research community should endeavour to compile diverse CoV reagents that can quickly be mobilized for rapid vaccine development, antiviral discovery, differential diagnosis, and specific diagnosis."
