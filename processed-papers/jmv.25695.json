The World Health Organization (WHO), after being informed about the viral disease on 31st December, believes that an animal source is the most likely primary source of the pathogenic disease.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]",

            "In Virus Taxonomy, coronaviruses belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae. These are known to be a family of enveloped non\u2010segmented positive\u2010sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. There are four known genera for coronaviruses, namely: alpha\u2010, beta\u2010, gamma\u2010, and delta\u2010coronavirus. All of the four genera are believed to have a zoonotic origin and infect both animals and humans. Whereas the alpha and beta genera originate from bats, the gamma and delta genera are derived from avian and pig gene pools.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]",
            "Given the high occurrence of coronaviruses, the large genetic variety and recurrent recombination of their genomes, and increasing human\u2010animal interface undertakings, new coronaviruses are likely to emerge sporadically in humans owing to periodic spillover events and common cross\u2010species infections. This explains the human infections of novel coronaviruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) in 2002, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) in 2012. Once in humans, the virus has the likelihood to spread from human\u2010to\u2010human, mainly causing respiratory diseases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]"
