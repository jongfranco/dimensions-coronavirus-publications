Three compounds exhibited an antiviral effect, the highest of which was compound 6b3 with an effective concentration 50% of 6.35 \u03bcM. The effects of 6b3 were then evaluated in vivo and a significant reduction in the lung index caused by RSV was detected. Reduced inflammatory infiltration and necrosis of the lungs were revealed by histopathology and gross pathology. Activation of an early immune response by 6b3 was also observed by cytokine analysis via a real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction. These results indicated that 6b3 has an anti\u2010RSV effect both in vitro and in vivo, and is a possible candidate compound for the development of an anti\u2010RSV drug in the future.",
