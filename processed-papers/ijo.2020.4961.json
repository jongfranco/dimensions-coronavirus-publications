        "abstract": "The activation of somatic mutations conferring sensitivity to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been widely used in the development of advanced or metastatic primary lung cancer therapy. Therefore, identification of EGFR mutations is essential. In the present study, a loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was used to identify EGFR mutations, and its efficiency was compared with the Therascreen quantitative PCR assay. Using LAMP and Therascreen to analyze surgically resected tissue samples from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutations were observed in 32/59 tumor samples (LAMP) and 33/59 tumor samples (Therascreen). Notably, the LAMP assay identified one tumor as wild\u2010type, which had previously been identified as a deletion mutation in exon 19 via the Therascreen assay (Case X). However, the direct sequencing to confirm the EGFR status of the Case X adhered to the results of the LAMP assay. Further experiments using Case X DNA identified this exon 19 deletion mutation using both methods. In addition, a novel deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR was identified. Overall, the present study shows that the LAMP method may serve as a valuable alternative for the identification oncogene mutations.",

            "Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality of all malignancies in the USA in 2011 and 2013 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Non\u2010small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for 70\u201085% of cases and is primarily treated using systemic chemotherapy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. However, NSCLC treatment has evolved due to the development of therapy targeting the activation of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].<br/><br/>EGFR activation is caused by genetic mutations, conferring susceptibility to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, and was first reported in 2004 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. EGFR mutations of pulmonary adenocarcinoma are present in 5\u201015% of the Caucasian population and 40\u201055% of the East Asian population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2010<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Clinical trials have shown that patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma with an EGFR mutation exhibit clinical responses to orally administered EGFR inhibitors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. In 2016, Lin et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] reported that 20/137 (14.6%) patients with EGFR\u2010mutant metastatic lung adenocarcinoma had a survival time of 5\u2010years [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Therefore, detection of EGFR mutations is an important step in the treatment\u2010decision pathway for patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma."

            "Tumor tissue samples. The tumor tissues were surgically resected from 189 consecutive patients diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma by the expert pathologist at The Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center (Kumagaya, Japan) between January 2016 and October 2017. All pathological diagnosis was determined on the basis of the WHO classification version 8 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] by an expert pathologist, who normally makes a diagnosis using HE\u2010stained slides using light microscope (Nikon Co., ECLIPSE Ni\u2010u) from a low magnification to a high magnification. The inclusion criteria were as follows: i) Surgically resected tissue of primary lung cancer; ii) pulmonary adenocarcinoma; iii) enough volume materials for molecular testing; and iv) informed written consent from patients. Conversely, cases with no informed consent or less volume sample were excluded. Clinical characteristics of the 59 patients are presented in Table I. The mean patient age was 69.6 years and included 28 males and 31 females. All samples were fixed with 10% buffer formalin at room temperature (24\u201036 h) to create formalin\u2010fixed, paraffin\u2010embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks at Department of Pathology in Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center. Hematoxylin\u2010eosin staining was performed by the standard method using Tissue\u2010Tek Prisma (Sakura Finetek Japan Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Prior to DNA extraction, the tumor content of each sample was assessed using light microscopy at x10 and x100 magnification, to ensure efficient PCR amplification. After sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated through a graded series of ethanol (100, 100, 85 and 70% ethanol), DNA from the tissue blocks was extracted using the QIAampTM DNA FFPE Tissue kit\u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) and analyzed using a QIAcube Robot\u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]."

        "discussion": [
            "EGFR mutations in pulmonary adenocarcinoma are associated with sensitivity to TKI therapy. Hence the identification of EGFR mutations has become a standard analysis in the treatment pathway of patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Although there are a number of methods available, there is no standardized approach to satisfy the practical clinical requirements of simplicity, rapid and cheap. Several PCR based methods have previously been used as a routine test for the detection of EGFR status in United States, European Union, Japan and China, including the Scorpion Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)\u00ae [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], such as Therascreen PCR assay. This method was approved by the FDA as a standard approach for EGFR gene analysis in lung cancer (fda. gov/medical\u2010devices/recently\u2010approved\u2010devices/therascreenr\u2010fg fr\u2010rgq\u2010pcr\u2010kit\u2010p180043); however, although stable and reliable, this approach has procedural complexities, including complex settings and controls for the temperature at several times using a thermal cycler. Alternatives, such as PCR\u2010Invader\u00ae [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>], peptide nucleic acid\u2010locked nucleic acid (PNA\u2010LNA) PCR clamp [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] and Cycleave PCRTM [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], have been developed in Japan and are commercially used in centralized laboratories. The sensitivity of the PNA\u2010LNA PCR clamp is >97% with 100% specificity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] and the accuracy of Cycleave PCR is 96.7% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>], so it was the same for our results as it was those."

Non\u2010small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for 70\u201085% of cases and is primarily treated using systemic chemotherapy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. However, NSCLC treatment has evolved due to the development of therapy targeting the activation of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "EGFR activation is caused by genetic mutations, conferring susceptibility to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, and was first reported in 2004 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. EGFR mutations of pulmonary adenocarcinoma are present in 5\u201015% of the Caucasian population and 40\u201055% of the East Asian population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2010<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Clinical trials have shown that patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma with an EGFR mutation exhibit clinical responses to orally administered EGFR inhibitors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. In 2016, Lin et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] reported that 20/137 (14.6%) patients with EGFR\u2010mutant metastatic lung adenocarcinoma had a survival time of 5\u2010years [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Therefore, detection of EGFR mutations is an important step in the treatment\u2010decision pathway for patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma.",
            "Previously, direct DNA sequencing was the standard method for detecting genetic mutations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]; however, at present, several alternative methods for mutation testing have been developed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. For example, the Therascreen EGFR PCR kit\u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) is a commercial quantitative (q)PCR kit and has been widely adopted for clinical practice; however, this method is time\u2010consuming and possesses certain procedural complexities, for example, requiring several temperature changes during DNA amplification [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Next\u2010generation sequencing has improved the efficiency of oncogene testing by high\u2010throughput sequencing, which can detect dozen of mutations at the same time, but the high\u2010cost of this technique limits its clinical usage [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].

The tumor tissues were surgically resected from 189 consecutive patients diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma by the expert pathologist at The Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center (Kumagaya, Japan) between January 2016 and October 2017. All pathological diagnosis was determined on the basis of the WHO classification version 8 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] by an expert pathologist, who normally makes a diagnosis using HE\u2010stained slides using light microscope (Nikon Co., ECLIPSE Ni\u2010u) from a low magnification to a high magnification. The inclusion criteria were as follows: i) Surgically resected tissue of primary lung cancer; ii) pulmonary adenocarcinoma; iii) enough volume materials for molecular testing; and iv) informed written consent from patients. Conversely, cases with no informed consent or less volume sample were excluded. Clinical characteristics of the 59 patients are presented in Table I. The mean patient age was 69.6 years and included 28 males and 31 females. All samples were fixed with 10% buffer formalin at room temperature (24\u201036 h) to create formalin\u2010fixed, paraffin\u2010embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks at Department of Pathology in Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center. Hematoxylin\u2010eosin staining was performed by the standard method using Tissue\u2010Tek Prisma (Sakura Finetek Japan Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Prior to DNA extraction, the tumor content of each sample was assessed using light microscopy at x10 and x100 magnification, to ensure efficient PCR amplification. After sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated through a graded series of ethanol (100, 100, 85 and 70% ethanol), DNA from the tissue blocks was extracted using the QIAampTM DNA FFPE Tissue kit\u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) and analyzed using a QIAcube Robot\u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>].",

Table II demonstrates that 33 EGFR mutations in the LAMP assay (18 samples with exon 21 L858R, 11 samples with exon deletions, 1 sample with exon S768I, and 2 samples with exon 18 G719X and exon 20 S768I), and that 32 EGFR mutations in the Therascreen assay (18 samples with exon 21 L858R, 12 samples with exon deletions, 1 sample with exon S768I, and 2 samples with exon 18 G719X and exon 20 S768I); i.e., there was one case showing EGFR wild type of the LAMP but one deletion mutation in exon 19 of the Therascreen PCR (Table III). As assuming that the results of Therascreen PCR assay was true, qualitative analysis was performed for calculating sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of the LAMP assay.

            "EGFR mutations in pulmonary adenocarcinoma are associated with sensitivity to TKI therapy. Hence the identification of EGFR mutations has become a standard analysis in the treatment pathway of patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Although there are a number of methods available, there is no standardized approach to satisfy the practical clinical requirements of simplicity, rapid and cheap. Several PCR based methods have previously been used as a routine test for the detection of EGFR status in United States, European Union, Japan and China, including the Scorpion Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)\u00ae [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], such as Therascreen PCR assay. This method was approved by the FDA as a standard approach for EGFR gene analysis in lung cancer (fda. gov/medical\u2010devices/recently\u2010approved\u2010devices/therascreenr\u2010fg fr\u2010rgq\u2010pcr\u2010kit\u2010p180043); however, although stable and reliable, this approach has procedural complexities, including complex settings and controls for the temperature at several times using a",
            "thermal cycler. Alternatives, such as PCR\u2010Invader\u00ae [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>], peptide nucleic acid\u2010locked nucleic acid (PNA\u2010LNA) PCR clamp [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] and Cycleave PCRTM [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], have been developed in Japan and are commercially used in centralized laboratories. The sensitivity of the PNA\u2010LNA PCR clamp is >97% with 100% specificity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] and the accuracy of Cycleave PCR is 96.7% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>], so it was the same for our results as it was those.",
            "LAMP is a new PCR method and is considered to be a robust approach for gene analysis as it does not require sophisticated or expensive equipment, such as a thermal cycler necessary for PCR [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Therefore, the LAMP method may have potential to decrease the costs of gene analysis. Previous studies have demonstrated the value of LAMP in field of bacteriology and virology [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]; however, few studies have reported the value of LAMP in oncology. Ikeda et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] used LAMP assays to detect EGFR mutations in NSCLC, demonstrating the value of LAMP, but only the L858R mutation was studied. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate other EGFR mutations, including those in exon 19, exon 21 and other minor mutations using LAMP assays.",
            "The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy values of LAMP for EGFR mutations compared with the Therascreen assay method were 97, 100, 100, 96.3 and 98.3%, respectively, demonstrating the potential of LAMP as an efficient alternative approach t oncogene mutation analyses. To evaluate the sensitivity of these two assays, a genetic analysis was performed to investigate the minimum concentration of EGFR mutation detection in both methods. The minimum concentration for LAMP was 4.8% and there were no detection under 1.0% in the Therascreen assay. Therefore, the minimum concentration for the LAMP assay is ~50 times higher than 4.8% in the Therascreen assay. With almost equal efficiency, detection of the exon 19 mutation in Case X using the Therascreen method suggested that LAMP, as well as direct sequence methods, could identify false negatives. However, additional experiments investigating Case X tumor tissues demonstrated the presence of deletion mutations in exon 19. The direct sequence method has reported low sensitivity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>], whereas the Therascreen method was generally recognized as a promising method [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. However, the identified mutation should be simplified, and an improved, faster and cheaper method of identification should be developed for its clinical application.",
            "The additional Case X experiments also identified a novel EGFR mutation using direct sequencing which was not identified using Therascreen or LAMP; however, this mutation may have been detected as an exon 19 deletion by the primers of the similarly targeted mutation. However, the details of the primer of LAMP method could not be disclosed due to the policies of Eiken Co., Ltd., and further information concerning the primers of Therascreen EGFR PCR kit could not be obtained due to the patent. Furthermore, the present study noted that this novel mutation was not included in the COSMIC database and that no previous studies had reported this mutation. Therefore, the present study is the first report this EGFR mutation, to the best of our knowledge.",
            "In conclusion, the LAMP method may be a valuable alternative for the identification of oncogenic mutations in lung cancer. Currently, the study group is developing a new method of detecting oncogenes using liquid biopsies (data not shown). In addition, a novel mutation, NG_007726.3:g.160744_16076 1delinsGCA, was identified exon 19 of EGFR. However, this needs further validation before clinical use."

        "Methods": [
            "The tumor tissues were surgically resected from 189 consecutive patients diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma by the expert pathologist at The Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center (Kumagaya, Japan) between January 2016 and October 2017.",
            "The inclusion criteria were as follows: i) Surgically resected tissue of primary lung cancer; ii) pulmonary adenocarcinoma; iii) enough volume materials for molecular testing; and iv) informed written consent from patients.",
            "All samples were fixed with 10% buffer formalin at room temperature (24\u201036 h) to create formalin\u2010fixed, paraffin\u2010embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks at Department of Pathology in Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center.",
            "After sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated through a graded series of ethanol (100, 100, 85 and 70% ethanol), DNA from the tissue blocks was extracted using the QIAampTM DNA FFPE Tissue kit\u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) and analyzed using a QIAcube Robot\u00ae (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Mean age of the 59 patients was 69.6 years and included 28 males and 31 females.",
            "All patients had been diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, including of 34 papillary predominant (57.6%), 7 solid predominant (11.9%), 3 acinar predominant (5.1%), 7 invasive mucinous (11.9%), 4 lepidic predominant (6.8%) and 4 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma cases (6.8%; all Table I).",
            "Therascreen EGFR PCR mutation analysis.",
            "Among 59 pulmonary tumors, there were 26 tumors with EGFR wild type and 33 tumors with EGFR mutations (Table II).",
            "18 exon 21 L858R point mutations (54.5%), 12 exon 19 deletions (36.4%), 2 simultaneous exon 18 G719X point mutation/exon 20 S768I point mutation (6.1%) and 1 exon 20 SS761I point mutation (3.0%) were detected in the pulmonary tumors with EGFR mutations (Table II)"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "EGFR mutations in pulmonary adenocarcinoma are associated with sensitivity to TKI therapy.",
            "Several PCR based methods have previously been used as a routine test for the detection of EGFR status in United States, European Union, Japan and China, including the Scorpion Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)\u00ae [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], such as Therascreen PCR assay",
            "This method was approved by the FDA as a standard approach for EGFR gene analysis in lung cancer; stable and reliable, this approach has procedural complexities, including complex settings and controls for the temperature at several times using a thermal cycler.",
            "The sensitivity of the PNA\u2010LNA PCR clamp is >97% with 100% specificity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] and the accuracy of Cycleave PCR is 96.7% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>], so it was the same for the results as it was those"
