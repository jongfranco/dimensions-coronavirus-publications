            "Developing countries such as Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh already have higher mortality rates from common pneumonias, despite the availability of vaccination and treatment. These countries may also suffer from poverty, political instability, terrorism, other endemic or epidemic infectious diseases competing for limited public health resources, low levels of literacy, and a lack of diagnostic or research laboratories. In this scenario, how would these countries be able to fight against the 2019-nCoV? Already suspected or confirmed cases have been reported in some of these countries. Unlike China, these countries are unlikely to be able to implement or withstand lockdown for several weeks or months, for both financial and organizational reasons. Therefore, it would seem advisable for these countries to spend their resources and energy on the primary level of prevention; either they need to prevent entry of individuals from China or they need to provide some means of containing the risk that these individuals present, for example by isolation or monitoring. Without proper enforcement of such measures it is even possible that people in China will be motivated to travel to those countries that are not enforcing controls, further increasing the risk of spread of the virus. Some people are portraying the control measures by the Chinese government negatively through social media, which has the potential to discourage other countries from implementing effective control measures. We suggest that robust measures to limit the international movement of infectious individuals should be a current priority in our fight against 2019nCoV.",
