        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The ability of coronaviruses infecting humans is invariably associated with their binding strengths to human receptor proteins. Both SARS-CoV-2, initially named 2019-nCoV, and SARS-CoV were reported to utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as entry receptor of human cells. To better understand the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, we performed computational alanine scanning mutagenesis, on the \u201chotspot\u201d residues at protein-protein interfaces, by relative free energy calculations. Our results suggested that the binding strengths of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the host receptor are comparable. Free energy calculations showed a promise in assessing the infectious ability of viruses on a physical basis, and can also provide useful information for the design of antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "introduction": [
            "A novel coronavirus strain, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), initially named 2019-nCoV and identified as the causative agent of the current respiratory illness outbreak (Coronavirus Disease 2019, COVID-19) in China, is a potential threat to global public health[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Genome sequence analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 shares ~80% nucleotide identity with the original virus strains of SARSCoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], another \u03b2 coronavirus that infects humans and has caused the 2002-2003 epidemic of atypical pneumonia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].<br/><br/>The SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S protein) consists of two subunits, the S1 subunit which is responsible for receptor binding, and the S2 which mediates membrane fusion of the viral and host membranes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. A receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of the S protein is located at residues 318\u2013510, the central region of S1 (Figure 1a). The RBD consists of a core region and some loop residues that are in direct contact with the receptor, designated the receptor-binding motif (RBM) (Figure 1a and 1b).<br/><br/>It was reported that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV utilize a common host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to infect human cells via the S protein RBD 911. The sequence identity of the RBDs was computed as 72.78%12. Despite the overall similarities, some of the hot spot residues at the protein-protein interfaces are intriguingly varied (Figure 1c). Several independent studies suggested that the receptor-binding ability of the virus is crucial for the susceptibility of the host to infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. As a result, being able to accurately calculate the binding strength changes of the RBD toward host acceptors caused by mutations are critical for assessing the likelihood of virus transmission among different hosts, especially the transmission among human beings."

        "results": [
            "The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD/ACE2 complex constructed using homologous modeling remained stable during the simulation. The configuration of the complex from the last frame of MD simulations aligned reasonably well with the crystal structure with a RMSD of 1.74 \u00c5 for the heavy atoms. The most substantial structural deviation came from the RBD loop regions that were distant from the binding interface. Surprisingly, despite the ~50% sequence similarity between SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBM region, the ACE2 contacting loop did not undergo significant conformational change.<br/><br/>N479 and T487 on SARS-CoV S RBD are the hot spot residues sensitive to host receptor recognition reported in previous studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>], corresponding to residues Q493 and N501 in SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). The N479K and T487S single point mutations reduced the binding affinity of SARS-CoV S RBD by over 30- and 20-fold, respectively[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In addition, the N479K/T487S double mutation decreased the affinity by over 1,000fold[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. As a result, we performed computational point mutations on the two hot spot residues and three of their neighboring residues that were involved in the local interactions, and compared the resulting free energy changes in SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2."
        ],
        "discussion": [
            "In the present work, we demonstrate that relative binding affinity calculation is a useful tool to study the transmission ability of the coronavirus. Our preliminary results showed that the mutations of several hot spot residues on SARS-CoV-2 S RBD did not weaken the binding to ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV, yet further investigation is required to validate our results for the following reasons. First, MD simulation was necessitated to relax the undesired contacts both in the homologous model and the crystal structure, and thus the quality of the protein force field was heavily relied on to produce conformations close to the native states. Secondly, our single-point alanine-scanning calculations only yielded the contribution of the individual residue without taking the coupling effect caused by double or multiple mutations into account. For example, L455 and F456 both had their side chains pointing toward the interface between SAS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2. Since the side chains of L455 and F456 were in proximity, it is reasonable to speculate that a large part of the \u2206\u2206Gbinding originated from their direct contacts. Thirdly, we only scanned the hot spot residues reported in literature on SARS-CoV, whereas the novel virus may have developed other positions that are sensitive to receptor binding. Lastly, enhanced sampling methods can potentially improve the rotation of the protein side chains, and may generate more accurate results when computational cost is not a concern."

        "Abstract": [
            "The ability of coronaviruses infecting humans is invariably associated with their binding strengths to human receptor proteins. Both SARS-CoV-2, initially named 2019nCoV, and SARS-CoV were reported to utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor of human cells. To better understand the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, we performed computational alanine scanning mutagenesis, on the \u201chotspot\u201d residues at protein-protein interfaces, by relative free energy calculations. Our results suggested that the binding strengths of SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 to the host receptor are comparable. Free energy calculations showed a promise in assessing the infectious ability of viruses on a physical basis, and can also provide useful information for the design of antiviral drugs."

        "Introduction": [
            "A novel coronavirus strain, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), initially named 2019-nCoV and identified as the causative agent of the current respiratory illness outbreak (Coronavirus Disease 2019, COVID-19) in China, is a potential threat to global public health[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Genome sequence analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 shares ~80% nucleotide identity with the original virus strains of SARSCoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], another \u03b2 coronavirus that infects humans and has caused the 2002-2003 epidemic of atypical pneumonia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].",
            "The SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S protein) consists of two subunits, the S1 subunit which is responsible for receptor binding, and the S2 which mediates membrane fusion of the viral and host membranes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. A receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of the S protein is located at residues 318\u2013510, the central region of S1 (Figure 1a). The RBD consists of a core region and some loop residues that are in direct contact with the receptor, designated the receptor-binding motif (RBM) (Figure 1a and 1b).",
            "It was reported that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV utilize a common host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to infect human cells via the S protein RBD 911. The sequence identity of the RBDs was computed as 72.78%12. Despite the overall similarities, some of the hot spot residues at the protein-protein interfaces are intriguingly varied (Figure 1c). Several independent studies suggested that the receptor-binding ability of the virus is crucial for the susceptibility of the host to infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. As a result, being able to accurately calculate the binding strength changes of the RBD toward host acceptors caused by mutations are critical for assessing the likelihood of virus transmission among different hosts, especially the transmission among human beings.",
            "Here we present our results of alanine scanning mutagenesis of SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 S RBD complexed with ACE2 using thermodynamic integration (TI)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. For SARSCoV-2, the TI calculations were performed on both of the crystal structure[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and the homology-based structure. The hot spot residues at the RBM were perturbed to alanine to generate the relative binding free energy change (\u2206\u2206Gbinding), which indicates the contribution of the perturbed residues to the molecular recognition of ACE2 by the virus. The results of this study demonstrate how vigorous free energy calculations can be used to predict the transmission ability of novel coronaviruses at an atomic level. The limitations of the current method are also discussed.",
            "Homologous Modeling Given the close homology of the S protein RBD regions between SARS-CoV-2 and",
            "SARS-CoV, the model of the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD/ACE2 complex was constructed based on the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV S RBD complexed with ACE2 (PDB ID: 2AJF) using SWISS-MODEL12. The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was obtained from the GenBank[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. The missing loop in the crystal structure was reconstructed using Rosetta[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. The Lys, Arg side chains as well as the N-terminus in both virus structures were set to be protonated. The Asp, Glu side chains and the C-terminus were set to be unprotonated. His[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] of ACE2 was set to be protonated at the \u03b5-nitrogen atom.",
            "MD Simulations All molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed with Amber1822 suite of programs. The Amber force field ff14SB23 and the TIP3P water model[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] were used. The homology model of SARS-CoV-2 complexed with ACE2 was solvated with an 8 \u00c5 buffer of water in a truncated octahedron box. Particle mesh Ewald (PME) scheme[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] was employed to calculate electrostatic energies. The cutoff of nonbonded interactions was set to 8 \u00c5. The long-range correction was used for van der Waals interactions (vdW)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].",
            "The whole system was first minimized using the gradient descent algorithm, with the maximal number of cycles set as 10000. Then it was heated up from 150K to 298K during 100 ps, followed by an NPT equilibration step lasting for 100 ps. Position restraints of 100 kcal/mol were imposed on all heavy atoms of proteins in those two steps.",
            "After that, the strength and scale of position restraints were gradually reduced to relax the system gently. An NPT ensemble and step size of 1 fs were used in all the following equilibration steps: first, the system was equilibrated with 10 kcal/mol position restraints on all heavy atoms for 250 ps. To relax the side chains, the system was further equilibrated with 10 kcal/mol, 1 kcal/mol, and 0.1 kcal/mol position restraints on all CA, C and N atoms subsequently, with each step lasting for 100 ps. Lastly, a 250-ps NPT equilibration was conducted with no restraints.",
            "MD simulation was performed to relax and verify the structure obtained from homologous modeling. The production phase was simulated in an NPT ensemble with the Berendsen barostat[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] for 100 ns. The temperature was regulated with a Langevin thermostat[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] at 298 K and the collision frequency was 1.0 ps-1. The pressure was controlled by isotropic position scaling, and the pressure relaxation time was set to 0.1 ps. Hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE29-30 algorithm. A time step of 2 fs was used for the production runs.",
            "Relative Binding Free Energy Calculations XFEP31 coupled with Amber-TI32-36 was used to calculate the relative binding free energies. The crystal structures S protein RBD on both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 complexed with ACE2, in addition to the last frame from the 100 ns simulation of SARSCoV-2 S RBD/ACE2 were used as the starting structures. The identical equilibration protocol for the MD simulations described above was used for the TI calculations. The perturbation for the alanine scanning was carried out in two steps: first, the partial charges were turned off for all the side-chain atoms on the residues of interest except for atom CB (i.e., the charges on all backbone atoms N, H, C, O, CA, HA, as well as CB were unchanged). Then, the residues of interest were transformed into Alanine using a dual-topology scheme with soft-core potentials[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] implemented in Amber-TI. For both of the perturbed residue and Alanine, scmask was set to exclude all the backbone atoms and atom CB. A total of 11 lambda windows were used for each step, with the \u03bb values for both steps evenly spaced between 0.0 and 1.0 with an interval of 0.1, including 0.0 and 1.0. Each \u03bb window was simulated for 4 ns. Trapezoidal integration was used to obtain the \u2206G. Free energy changes were calculated for both of the bound and the unbound state of the RBD."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD/ACE2 complex constructed using homologous modeling remained stable during the simulation. The configuration of the complex from the last frame of MD simulations aligned reasonably well with the crystal structure with a RMSD of 1.74 \u00c5 for the heavy atoms. The most substantial structural deviation came from the RBD loop regions that were distant from the binding interface. Surprisingly, despite the ~50% sequence similarity between SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBM region, the ACE2 contacting loop did not undergo significant conformational change.",
            "N479 and T487 on SARS-CoV S RBD are the hot spot residues sensitive to host receptor recognition reported in previous studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>], corresponding to residues Q493 and N501 in SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). The N479K and T487S single point mutations reduced the binding affinity of SARS-CoV S RBD by over 30- and 20-fold, respectively[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In addition, the N479K/T487S double mutation decreased the affinity by over 1,000fold[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. As a result, we performed computational point mutations on the two hot spot residues and three of their neighboring residues that were involved in the local interactions, and compared the resulting free energy changes in SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2.",
            "Our results of alanine scanning showed that all native to alanine mutations studied here disfavored binding, except for Q498A computed using homology-based structure, with a \u2206\u2206Gbinding value of -1.3 kcal/mol. All mutations on SARS-CoV showed mild to moderate effect, whereas three mutations, L455A, F456A, and Q493A on SARS-CoV-2 weakened the binding for over 2 kcal/mol. Results based on the MD-relaxed homologous structure agreed well with those using the crystal structure, except that the N501A showed a relatively large difference of 4.2 kcal/mol.",
            "We then examined in more details on how those mutations affected the local interactions. It was observed that the methyl group on the side chain of T487 on SARSCoV RBD was in close contact with K353 of ACE2, which facilitated the interaction formed between K353 and D38 on ACE2 at the interface (Figure 3a)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. Our simulation showed that the amide group on the side chain of N501 formed a hydrogen bond with Y41 on ACE2, and thus stabilized the contact between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2. This finding was confirmed by the crystal structure (Figure 3b and 3c). Note that the N501A mutation had a large uncertainty of 1.8 kcal/mol, which implied that N501 was not fully sampled during the perturbation, probably due to the complex interactions and multiple binding modes in this region. In the homology-based calculations, Q498 disrupted the K353-D38 salt bridge, whereas this salt bridge was not observed in the crystal structure (Figure 3b and 3c). The difference of the rotamer states and interactions of residues near N501 in the crystal structure and homology model may explain the significant difference of the calculated \u2206\u2206Gbinding for N501 in these two structures.",
            "Another interesting observation was the hydrogen bonding interactions formed by Q493 on SARS-CoV-2 RBD with E35 and K31 across the interface. In the crystal structure of SAR-CoV RBD/ACE, N479 at the corresponding position was protected within a local hydrophobic pocket formed by Y440 and Y442 (Figure 4a). In the crystal structure of SAR-CoV-2 RBD/ACE, the longer side chain of Q493 made it capable of extending out of the pocket and reaching out to ACE2 residues to form hydrogen bonding interaction (Figure 4b). L455 and F456 on SAS-CoV-2 facilitated those interactions by making a better fit to the hydrophobic environment than Y442 and L443 in SARS-CoV. The MD simulations accurately predicted the local interactions and the orientations of the residues (Figure 4c and 4d)."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "In the present work, we demonstrate that relative binding affinity calculation is a useful tool to study the transmission ability of the coronavirus. Our preliminary results showed that the mutations of several hot spot residues on SARS-CoV-2 S RBD did not weaken the binding to ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV, yet further investigation is required to validate our results for the following reasons. First, MD simulation was necessitated to relax the undesired contacts both in the homologous model and the crystal structure, and thus the quality of the protein force field was heavily relied on to produce conformations close to the native states. Secondly, our single-point alanine-scanning calculations only yielded the contribution of the individual residue without taking the coupling effect caused by double or multiple mutations into account. For example, L455 and F456 both had their side chains pointing toward the interface between SAS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2. Since the side chains of L455 and F456 were in proximity, it is reasonable to speculate that a large part of the \u2206\u2206Gbinding originated from their direct contacts. Thirdly, we only scanned the hot spot residues reported in literature on SARS-CoV, whereas the novel virus may have developed other positions that are sensitive to receptor binding. Lastly, enhanced sampling methods can potentially improve the rotation of the protein side chains, and may generate more accurate results when computational cost is not a concern.",
            "It is rather encouraging that our computational alanine scan results and nonbonded interactions observed based on homology models agreed well with those produced based on the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, our computational alanine scanning of hot spot residues was completed three weeks before the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD/ACE2 was released. Information obtained from reliable modeling and simulations can be critical when a novel virus emerges, while the experimental structure cannot be solved immediately. In addition, alanine scan data could reveal the new hot spots on the novel virus and the host receptor, and thus support the rational design of peptide and antibody therapeutics, as well as smallmolecule drugs. In our ongoing work, we aim to carry out a thorough scanning of the interface residues and improve our prediction protocols by bringing together enhanced sampling, group mutations, and experimental validation.",
