        "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in China has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Based on angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV, we used the hACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenicity of the virus. Weight loss and virus replication in lung were observed in hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical histopathology was interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of significant lymphocytes and monocytes in alveolar interstitium, and accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities. Viral antigens were observed in the bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelia. The phenomenon was not found in wild type mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 mice was clarified and the Koch\u2019s postulates were fulfilled as well, and the mouse model may facilitate the development of therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

The typical histopathology was interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of significant lymphocytes and monocytes in alveolar interstitium, and accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities.",
            "Viral antigens were observed in the bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelia. The phenomenon was not found in wild type mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 mice was clarified and the",

It is critical to find the pathogenicity and biology of the virus for prevention and treatment of the disease.",
            "Because SARS-CoV-2 was highly homologous with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which was the entry receptor of SARS-CoV, was also considered to have a high binding ability with the SARS-CoV-2 by molecular biological analysis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Therefore, we used the hACE2 transgenic and wild type (WT) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenicity of the virus.",
            "Specific pathogen-free, 6-11-month-old, male and female WT mice (WT-HB-01, n=15) and hACE2 mice (ACE2-HB-01, n=19) were inoculated intranasally with SARS-",

Notably, the weight loss of ACE2-HB-01 mice was up to 8% at 5 days post infection (dpi) (Figure 1a).",
            "Next, viral replication and pathological changes were examined from three animals per group at each time point, and the primary organs were collected periodically, including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, intestine and testis. As shown in Figure",

Consistent to the results of viral loads, infectious virus was respectively isolated from the lungs of ACE2-HB-01 mice at 1 dpi, 3 dpi and 5 dpi, and the highest virus titers were detected at 3 dpi (102.44 TCID50/100 \u03bcl) (Figure 1c).

The lesions progressed into multifocal to coalescent scattered-dark reddish purple areas and focal palpable nodules throughout the lung lobes at 5 dpi (Figure 2a). The damaged lungs became swollen and enlarged in size. Microscopically, consistently, lung tissues from ACE2-HB-01 mice at 3 dpi showed moderate, multifocal, interstitial pneumonia. Inflammatory cells including lymphocytes and monocytes accumulated in the alveolar interstitium and caused thickening of the alveolar walls (Figure 2a). Increased collagen fiber in the thickened alveolar interstitium in the ACE2-HB-01 mice was confirmed by Modified Masson's Trichrome stain with blue colors (Supplementary",

            "Perivascular infiltrated inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and monocytes, were observed multifocally within and adjacent to affected areas of the lungs. At 5 dpi, the lung progressed into coalescing interstitial pneumonia with diffuse lesions. Thickened alveolar septa were filled with lymphocytes and monocytes (Figure 2a). IHC staining of sequential section revealed that viral antigens were found in the alveolar macrophages, alveolar epithelia, and the degenerative and being desquamated bronchial epithelial cells (Figure 2b).

Although it has been determined by bioinformatics that the pathogen of this epidemic is a novel coronavirus, it is necessary to be confirmed by animal experiments following Koch's postulates.",
            "In the present study, after the experimental infection of hACE2 transgenic mice with one of the earliest known isolates of SARS-CoV-2, the mice lost weight and showed interstitial pneumonia, which are comparable with initial clinical reports of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-27. Meanwhile, virus replication was detected in the lung of",

In clinical autopsy, histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Correspondingly, ACE2-HB-01 mice showed coalescing interstitial pneumonia in this study. Furthermore, specifically histopathology changes and progress were observed in the mice, e.g. affected bronchioles were filled with occasionally small amounts of periodic acid schiff (PAS) positive-exudation or denatured and detached brochiolar epithelium.",
            "The case fatality rate of currently reported cases is about 2%, which implies that so far, this novel coronavirus does not seem to cause the high fatality rates as SARS-CoV (9-11%)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], which suggested the difference in pathogenicity between the two viruses. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 seems mild compared to SARS-CoV in mice, the latter caused extrapulmonary organ damage, includes brain, kidney, intestine, heart and liver, furthermore, the neurons are susceptible for SARS-CoV infection, and cerebral casculitis and hemorrhage were observed in hACE2 transgenic mice[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. However, only interstitial pneumonia was observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2 mice, implying the disparity in pathogenicity of the coronavirus.",
