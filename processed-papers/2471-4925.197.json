            "Since the notification to WHO of the first suspected cases of nCoV2019 on 31 December 2019, the story evolution looks like as if we are currently thrown at the edge of global health crisis. The continuation of successive episodes of emerging pathogens places the world on the edge of unprecedented threat. The current CoV epidemic has managed to expand the scope of its spread in a remarkable way to many countries and diverse population groups without visible indicators showing the possibility of limiting the spread of the outbreak and narrowing its scope. Thus, the cosmic community finds itself with two main issues, the first is the weak capabilities of prediction and preparedness, and the second is the inability to contain early outbreaks using the resources available for national and local health systems [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",

        "Outbreak Morbidities and Mortalities": [
            "Time after time, the numbers and the facts related to an outbreak, whether current or previous outbreaks reflect that we often find ourselves with growing and accelerating numbers of injuries that expand in their temporal and spatial dimensions that exceeds the available capabilities to reduce it despite the application of all available protocols. There is a need for a new look with innovative mechanisms for confrontation and response. The course of outbreaks often reflects frightening statistics on the level of disease incidence and prevalence and mortality rates among different population groups. Thinking outside the box in an unfamiliar way is needed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]."

        "Economic Implications": [
            "In most times, cross-border outbreaks place the fate of the world on the edge of the threat and economic overburden due to its direct impact on the movement of trade and tourism-related activities as well as productive activities with thousands of people out of the cycle of production and productive economic activity. Thus, the burdens multiply and take other forms that are not limited to the direct health and financial burdens required to deal with the disease, but rather extend to the burdens of the global economic slowdown and its deterioration [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]."
        ],
        "Gaps in the International Public Health System": [
            "The international public health system needs a new leadership vision-based largely on the ability to predict and initiate rather than wait and respond. This may be achieved by linking vital information systems with public health sciences and bringing epidemiology side by side with information and data management techniques, and artificial intelligence, in addition to genetic studies related to epidemic mutant viruses. The international health system has made significant steps towards the principles of early prevention and avoiding the underlying and imminent dangers. We can say that one of the most important reasons for the inability of the international global health systems to anticipate and challenge epidemics before they occur is that we are not yet able to use the available resources effectively and benefit from the data despite the tremendous progress in the sciences and technologies that humankind has achieved [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]."
