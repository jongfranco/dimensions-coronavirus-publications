        "abstract": "One Gram-negative Bacillus was isolated from a brain sample of a pig with neurological symptoms. Pathological examination showed meningitis at necropsy. Ochrobactrum anthropi (O. anthropi) was successfully isolated from the brain sample and was confirmed by biochemical reaction results (API 20 NE) and gene sequencing. The strain was highly resistant to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Mice were experimentally infected with O. anthropi and showed typical meningitis. This is the first report on O. anthropi isolated from a pig, and indicates that O. anthropi may have a broader host spectrum of infection.",
