Therefore, we urgently established diagnostic systems for 2019-nCoV as the national diagnostic laboratory in Japan.",
            "We first developed a conventional reverse transcription (RT)\u2013PCR assay for 2019CoV. Because neither the viral RNA nor test controls were available, many primer sets were constructed with Primer-BLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primerblast/) and their performances were evaluated with real test specimens. In the diagnostic tests for the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV infection in Japan, nine specific primers and pan-coronaviral primers were used and primer set 1 (open reading frame 1 [ORF1] set) produced a specific band. The 2019-nCoV sequence was decoded from the amplicon (2). Primers for the spike (S) protein (S set) also detected the 2019-nCoV sequence in different specimens from the same patient (3). Therefore, these two primer sets were considered suitable for the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection. To increase the sensitivity and specificity of the assays, primers for a second PCR were constructed, and special primers were also prepared to sequence the PCR products (Table 1). Total RNA was extracted from the specimen with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using random and oligo-dT primers. The PCR was performed with Quick Taq\u00ae HS DyeMix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), with the primers at final concentrations of 800 nM. The PCR thermal cycling conditions were: 94 \u00b0C for 1 min; 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 56 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 68 \u00b0C for 1 min. The second (nested) PCR was performed with 1 \u03bcL of the first PCR product under the same conditions. The PCR products were purified with AMpure XP (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), and directly sequenced with the sequencing primers and the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific). As expected, these primers detected the 2019-nCoV-specific amplicons with no nonspecific reactions when the second confirmed case in Japan was diagnostically tested (4). Using test controls is important in the quality control of diagnostic tests. We constructed positive controls using PCR primers and the MERS-CoV sequences, enabling to check the correct combination of primer usage (Fig. 1a). The amplicon sizes of the controls in the second PCR were smaller than those obtained with PCR using viral RNA (Fig. 2a). This size difference allowed us to distinguish real positive bands from unexpected contamination of control RNAs.",
            "PCR assay system was required to process large numbers of specimens. Corman et al reported three real-time RT\u2013PCR assays (based on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp] gene, envelope [E] gene, and nucleocapsid [N] gene) for detecting beta coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV (5). Considering the distribution of diagnostic methods to the local health research institutes in Japan, the validation test was performed with the QuantiTect Probe RT\u2013PCR Kit (QuantiTect, Qiagen). Because all local institutes are equipped this reagent, they could establish the test as soon as possible. Among the three primer sets, only the N gene set performed well against the synthesized control RNA template in the QuantiTect assay (data not shown). Therefore, the N gene set was used in our diagnostic test system as N set no.",
            "1. Another candidates were constructed based on the 2019-nCoV sequence (MN908947.1) with the Primer 3 software (ver. 4.0, http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/). We checked their specificity for 2019-nCoV by comparison with six other human coronavirus sequences. Then, they were validated using synthesized each specific control RNA. The primer set that targeted the N protein, but differed from the N set no. 1, had passed the quality check test and used as N set no. 2 (N2). Details of the sets are shown in Table 1. Both sets showed sufficient sensitivity (~5\u2013 50 copies for the control RNA) and no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses. The pathogens tested were those used previously (6). The real-time RT\u2013PCR was performed with the QuantiTect Probe RT\u2013PCR Kit and LightCycler 480 (or 96) (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The thermal cycling conditions were: 50 \u00b0C for 30 min; 95 \u00b0C for 15 min; and 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. The N2 set was also used in the diagnostic test for the second confirmed case of 2019-CoV infection in Japan, with a positive result, consistent with the nested RT\u2013PCR (4). Both sets were used to confirm the third and fourth positive cases of infection in Japan, in parallel with nested RT\u2013PCR, demonstrating the equivalent sensitivity and specificity of the real-time RT\u2013PCR and nested RT\u2013PCR assays. Thereafter, the national diagnostic test in our laboratory was mainly performed with the real-time RT\u2013PCR assay. Like the positive controls for nested RT\u2013PCR, those for real-time RT\u2013PCR contained marker sequences (BamHI site and a check probe sequence) (Fig. 1b). When laboratory contamination is possible, for example when a positive signal is detected in the negative control, the addition of a VIC-labeled check probe (VIC-AGCTAGCGCATTGGATCTCG-MGB) to the reaction mixture allowed us to detect the contamination.",
            "Finally, the nested RT\u2013PCR and real-time RT\u2013PCR assays for 2019-nCoV were distributed with positive controls to 84 prefectural and municipal public health institutes and 13 quarantine depots. As of 8 February 2020, 25 cases of 2019-CoV infection have been confirmed in Japan (7). The real-time RT\u2013PCR assay has shown satisfactory performance. We knew that the reverse primer of the N2 set has a one-nucleotide mismatch (C29277G, Table 1) with the sequence in the current database (MN908947.3), because it was constructed based on first reported sequence (MN908947.1). Validation of the version 3 sequence of the N2 reverse primer (N2 ver.3) was performed with serially diluted viral RNA and the control RNA (Fig. 2b). The N2 and N2 ver.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] sets showed almost the same quantitation cycle (Cq) values for both the viral RNA and control RNA, indicating that this mismatch did not affect the amplification and that both the ver.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] and ver.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] primers are available for the detection of 2019-nCoV.",
