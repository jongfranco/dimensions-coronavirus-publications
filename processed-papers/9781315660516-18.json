            "In Chapter 18, Jung Wook Lee examines the state and change in performance management, particularly focusing on the performance management of central government agencies by the Prime Minister\u2019s office. Lee focuses on the performance management system mandated by the 2006 Framework Act on Government Performance Evaluation (FAGPE). The chapter consists of three parts. The first presents an overview of performance management as a contemporary approach to managing government organizations and programs. The second part covers how performance management works in the central government, elaborating on a series of processes and procedures required by the FAGPE; the law specifies what individual agencies have to do at each stage of the performance management process, while stipulating how the government-wide implementation of the performance management system should be managed. The last part looks back on more than ten years of experience in this large-scale, complex performance management experiment and offers suggestions for more successful implementation of performance management in the central government."
