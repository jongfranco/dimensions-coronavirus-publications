        "abstract": "Introduction: In tropical Singapore, influenza occurs all year\u2010round. This study of in\u2010 fluenza\u2010confirmed hospitalized pediatric patients compared clinical characteristics and complications by age\u2010group and differences between influenza A and B. Methods: This was a retrospective study of pediatric inpatients from January 2013 to December 2014. Patients were grouped into: <6 months, 6 months to <5 years, 5\u2010 to <10\u2010year and \u226510 years. Complications were classified into neurologic, pulmo\u2010 nary, and other. We also calculated the incidence of hospitalized influenza cases per 100 000 age\u2010related population. Results: There were a total of 1272 patients with a median age of 37 months. The highest hospitalization rates were in the <6 months age\u2010group. Majority (75.2%) had no comorbidity; 25.6% had complications: neurologic 11.9%, pulmonary 9.6%, other 4.1%. Patients with other complications were older, male, and had the highest influ\u2010 enza B rates and the longest length of stay. Influenza A comprised 76.9% of cases and had higher complication rates especially neurologic, compared to influenza B. Influenza B patients were older and were more likely to develop other complications. The 6\u2010month to <5\u2010year\u2010age\u2010group had the highest complication rate (30.6%), espe\u2010 cially neurologic. However, \u226510 years old had the highest other complications, ICU/ high\u2010dependency admissions and influenza B Victoria rates. Conclusions: Infants <6 months had the highest hospitalization rates for influenza. The 6\u2010month to <5\u2010year\u2010age\u2010group had the highest complication rate especially neu\u2010 rologic. Influenza A patients were younger, had higher seizure rates and complica\u2010 tions compared to influenza B.",

However, more severe cases could have been included in this study due to the higher viral burden in respiratory secretions detectable by IF rather than PCR. Obesity was likely under\u2010reported as only 55% of patients had their height taken, thereby leading to an omission of BMI used to determine obesity status. Another limitation was the lack of information of prior in\u2010 fluenza vaccination; however, uptake for influenza vaccination in children has generally been poor. Although influenza vaccination is recommended for children under 5 years of age or those with underlying high\u2010risk factors, it is not in the national immuniza\u2010 tion schedule for children and therefore not routinely offered.

Obesity was likely under\u2010reported as only 55% of patients had their height taken, thereby leading to an omission of BMI used to determine obesity status. Another limitation was the lack of information of prior in\u2010 fluenza vaccination; however, uptake for influenza vaccination in children has generally been poor. Although influenza vaccination is recommended for children under 5 years of age or those with underlying high\u2010risk factors, it is not in the national immuniza\u2010 tion schedule for children and therefore not routinely offered.
