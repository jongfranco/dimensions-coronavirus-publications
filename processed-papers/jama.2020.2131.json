            "Discussion | Based on the sources of data used in this study, 9 infants were infected with COVID-19 and were hospitalized in China between December 2019 and February 6, 2020. Given the number of infections reported, the number of infected infants identified was small. This may be due to a lower risk of exposure or incomplete identification due to mild or asymptomatic disease, rather than resistance to infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] However, this study showed that infants can be infected by COVID19; the earlier stage of the COVID-19 epidemic primarily involved adults older than 15 years.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]",
            "Family clustering occurred for all infected infants. Infants who have infected family members should be monitored or evaluated and family clustering should be reported to ensure a timely diagnosis.",
            "Seven of the 9 infant patients were female. Previous studies found higher percentages of infection in men than women.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Whether female infants may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than male infants requires further study.",
            "The study was limited by small sample size, inclusion only of infants who were hospitalized, and lack of inclusion of asymptomatic patients. Although a systematic and comprehensive search was made for relevant infections in infants, the epidemic is spreading rapidly and incomplete identification of cases is possible.",
            "Because infants younger than 1 year cannot wear masks, they require specific protective measures. Adult caretakers should wear masks, wash hands before close contact with infants, and sterilize the infants\u2019 toys and tableware regularly.",
