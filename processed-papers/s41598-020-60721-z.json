        "abstract": "Bats are associated with several important zoonotic viruses from different families. One example includes adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), that are extensively detected in several animals, especially primates. To understand AAVs distribution and genetic diversity in the coastal areas of Southeast China, a total of 415 intestine samples were mostly collected from two provinces of southeast China, i.e., Zhejiang and Fujian province. Intestine samples from five bat species were collected for AAVs detection. The average prevalence rate for AAV detection among these samples was 18.6% (77 positives out of 415 samples) and ranged from 11.8 to 28.9% between the five bat species. This suggests that AAVs are widely distributed in diverse bat populations in southeast coastal areas of China. Based on the genome sequence of bat adeno-associated virus-CXC1(BtAAV-CXC1) from one AAV-positive sample, the genetic diversity of the detected AAVs were assessed and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BtAAV-CXC1 was comparatively distant to other major AAVs from mammals and non-mammals, with only a 52.9~64.7% nucleotide identity. However, they were phylogenetically closer to Rhinolophus sinicus bat adeno-associated virus (Rs-BtAAV1), with a 74.5% nt similarity. Partial analysis of the rep and cap overlapping open reading frame (ORF) sequences from bat AAV samples revealed 48 partial rep sequences and 23 partial cap sequences from positive samples shared 86.9 to 100% and 72.3 to 98.8% nucleotide identities among themselves, respectively. This suggests that the detected AAVs had a distinctly high genetic diversity. These findings led us to conclude that diverse AAVs may be widely distributed in bat populations from the southeast regions of China.",

        "discussion": [
            "Adeno-associated viruses were detected from the majority of bats collected from the southeastern coastal regions of China. However, no adeno-associated virus was successfully isolated from Vero E6 cells and no genomic sequences of adeno-associated virus were detected in challenge experiments using suckling mice. This may be due to the viral replication of adeno-associated viruses that rely on adenovirus proliferation and expansion.<br/><br/>Four out of the five insectivorous bat species, including Rhinolophus pusillus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Scotophilus kuhli, and Myotis davidii, have been reported to be native carriers of diverse AAVs around the southeastern coastal regions of China. The average prevalence rate is as high as 18.6%, which suggests that AAVs are considerably prevalent among various bat species. However, the absence of Myotis formosus AAV in this study may be due to the limited sampling size. Partial rep and cap ORF sequences analysis of the detectable bat AAVs revealed a relatively large genetic diversity among the bat samples. This suggests that diverse AAVs may be widely distributed in bat populations as previous studies have reported[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. However, further extensive work has to be performed to discover new AAV strains and their native bat species around the southeastern coastal regions of China."

            "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) were discovered in 1965 as a small contaminant. AAVs are a group of small single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses without envelopes that belong to the parvovirus family. The entire genome of AAV is approximately 4.7 kb and contains two major ORFs that encode for Rep and Cap proteins. Under normal circumstances, the AAV virus can coexist within the mammalian host for an extended period without apparent pathogenicity. However, productive infection only occurs in the presence of a helper virus, either adenovirus or herpesvirus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Due to this, AAV has become an important gene therapy vector for its non-pathogenic and conditional infectious life cycle[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "The genetic diversity of AAV is very high among its natural hosts. To date, thirteen AAV serotypes (designated AAV1-AAV13) and more than 100 unique variants have been isolated and identified from primate and non-primate hosts[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Hosts can be as diverse as Chiropteras, Porcine, Serpentes, Bovines, Caprines and Chickens. Among these natural hosts, bats are more geographically dispersed. In addition, Bats host a greater number of emerging viruses per species compared to any other mammalian clade[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Bats have been increasingly recognized as a natural host for AAVs in recent years, in addition to the many other important zoonotic viruses, such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola virus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. With the development of molecular and sequencing technologies, numerous novel AAVs are being discovered. These include BtAAV-YNM14, Rp-BtAAV1 and Rs-BtAAV132. Yan Li identified several adenoviruses and AAVs in a wide host range of bat species with remarkable genetic diversity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Lau SKP investigated the presence of parvoviruses among different bat species in Hong Kong and mainland China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. Their work broadened the current knowledge of AAV diversity in Bats. Several studies also have investigated the origins of viral diversity in bats or the maintenance of bat-associated viruses in nature. In addition, considerable emphasis has been placed on understanding the direct epidemiological interface from bats to humans[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]."

The Rep and Cap proteins of BtAAV-CXC1 shared an average of 61.0% (ranging from 46.4 to 85.7%) and 27.7% (ranging from 10.7 to 35.5%) pairwise amino acid identity, respectively to the reference AAV genome (Fig. 2). This demonstrated that the genome of BtAAV-CXC1 was obviously different from the reference AAV genome in this study.",
            "Phylogenetic origin of BtAAV-CXC1.  In order to investigate the phylogenetic origin of BtAAV-CXC1, a large-scale maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenic tree was constructed with 26 sequences from members of the Dependovirus genus (both full length and partial genomes). The ML tree demonstrated that BtAAV-CXC1 was",
            "most closely related to Rs-BtAAV1, a previously reported BtAAV from a Rhinolophus sinicus bat[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>], with a 25.5% nucleotide difference (Fig. 3). BtAAV-CXC1 was also related to other bat AAVs with a 58.4\u201377.5% nt identity and was relatively divergent from the majority of AAVs from primates and other animals (i.e., bovines, chicken, waterfowl and snakes), with a 52.9\u201364.7% nucleotide similarity. These findings indicated that BtAAV-CXC1 was a novel BtAAV species.",
            "Partial rep and cap sequence analysis of bat AAVs.  To investigate the genetic diversity of bat AAVs, partial rep and cap ORF sequences were obtained through direct sequencing of the PCR products (n = 48 and n = 23; selected from positive samples during the PCR screening assay). The amplified regions covered 1100 nt of the cap region and 841nt of the rep region based on Rs-BtAAV1 (GenBank accession number: MF682927). As shown in Fig. 4, 48 amplicons of the rep region were grouped into bat clade with 86.9 to 100% nucleotide identities between them. In addition, they shared 71.5 to 84.2% identities with other AAVs (Table 2). Further analysis of the 23 partial cap sequences demonstrated that 23 bat AVVs shared 72.3 to 98.8% nucleotide identities among themselves and 59.4 to 72.9% identities with other AAVs (Fig. 5). These results demonstrated that diverse AAVs were widely distributed in bat populations from the southeast coastal regions of China."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Adeno-associated viruses were detected from the majority of bats collected from the southeastern coastal regions of China. However, no adeno-associated virus was successfully isolated from Vero E6 cells and no genomic sequences of adeno-associated virus were detected in challenge experiments using suckling mice. This may be due to the viral replication of adeno-associated viruses that rely on adenovirus proliferation and expansion.",
            "Four out of the five insectivorous bat species, including Rhinolophus pusillus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Scotophilus kuhli, and Myotis davidii, have been reported to be native carriers of diverse AAVs around the southeastern coastal regions of China. The average prevalence rate is as high as 18.6%, which suggests that AAVs are considerably prevalent among various bat species. However, the absence of Myotis formosus AAV in this study may be due to the limited sampling size. Partial rep and cap ORF sequences analysis of the detectable bat AAVs revealed a relatively large genetic diversity among the bat samples. This suggests that diverse AAVs may be widely distributed in bat populations as previous studies have reported[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. However, further extensive work has to be",
            "performed to discover new AAV strains and their native bat species around the southeastern coastal regions of China.",
            "The phylogenetic study of BtAAV-CXC1 with 26 other AAVs suggested that it was a novel AAV member of the genus Dependovirus. It was phylogenetically closer to mammalian AAVs compared to avian, waterfowl or snake AAVs. BtAAV-CXC1 shared a large branch with the previously reported Rp-BtAAV1, BtAAV1-YNM, and other known human or non-human primates AAVs. This included Adeno-associated virus A, Adeno-associated virus B, and all proven human AAVs (Fig. 3). Amino acid sequence analysis of the rep gene of this novel BtAAV-CXC1 showed 64.8% similarity with human AAV2. Similar results were obtained in a previous study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. In addition, several previous studies have indicated that mammalian and non-mammalian AAVs had a separate evolutionary path, except for a few avian, waterfowl and reptilian AAVs that were distantly related to mammalian AAVs. Bats are thought to be the original host for alpha coronaviruses and beta coronaviruses, while birds for gamma coronaviruses and delta coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. The discovery of additional AAVs from bats and other mammals will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary origin and pathways of mammalian AAVs. Our study found that the co-occurrence of bat adenovirus and AAV in bat samples was as high as 33.7%, which was similar to the findings in Li et.al.\u2019s study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. This may be because other viruses such as herpesvirus and vaccinia virus are essential for the replication of AAV39.",
            "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are frequently used viral vectors in biomedical research and human gene therapy. The clinical use of AAV vectors have been studied in detail. Over 160 phase I, II, and III clinical trials have been implemented since 1994, and have noticeably increased since 201140. To date, substantial efforts have been dedicated on engineering strategies to develope novel AAV capsid variants with increased tropism for precise cell types with lower seroreactivity, and increased manufacturability. Our results revealed that the deduced Cap protein of BtAAV-CXC1 shared an average of 27.7% (ranging from 10.7 to 35.5%) pairwise amino acid identity with other mammalian AAVs. This suggests that the Cap protein of BtAAV-CXC1 may have a low cross-serological reactivity to known mammalian AAVs and hence could likely be considered to an substitutable vector for gene therapy.",
            "In conclusion, our study of viruses in bat samples in southeast China identified novel AAVs and their distinct genetic diversity. This extends our knowledge of the diversity of bat AAVs and its evolution and emergence in humans and animals. However additional studies are warranted using larger samplings from different locations to further understand the global diversity of bat viruses."
