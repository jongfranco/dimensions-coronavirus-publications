        "abstract": "The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019\u2010nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019\u2010nCoV sequence. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019\u2010nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin\u2010unknown coronavirus. The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019\u2010nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination may occur and contribute to the 2019\u2010nCoV cross\u2010species transmission.",

Overall, the ancestral origin of the 2019\u2010nCoV was more likely from divergent host species rather than SARS\u2010CoV.",

Unlike SARS\u2010CoV, the 2019\u2010nCoV appeared to initially cause a mild form of viral pneumonia and have limited capability for person\u2010 person spread. This might be due to the recombination occurred within the receptor\u2010binding glycoprotein. However, there is a concern about its adaptation in humans that may acquire the capability to replicate more efficiently and spread more rapidly via close person\u2010person contact.",
            "In summary, results derived from our evolutionary analysis suggest that 2019\u2010nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and has most similar codon usage bias with snake. Additionally, a homologous recombination may occured within the viral receptor\u2010binding spike glycoprotein, which may determine cross\u2010species transmission.
