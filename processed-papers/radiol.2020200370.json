        "abstract": "Statement In patients recovering from COVID-19 infection, four stages of evolution on chest CT were identified: early stage (0-4 days); progressive stage (5-8 days); peak stage (10-13 days); and absorption stage\nIn (\u226514 days).\nKey Results 1. In patients who recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia, initial lung findings on chest CT were small subpleural ground glass opacities (GGO) that grew larger with crazy-paving pattern and consolidation. 2. Lung involvement increased to consolidation up to two weeks after disease onset. 3. After two weeks, the lesions were gradually absorbed leaving extensive GGO and subpleural parenchymal bands.",

            "1. Patient characteristics: A total of 21 patients (6 males and 15 females) were included in the study. The average age was 40\u00b19 s years (Table 1). The most prevalent presenting symptoms were fever (86%) and cough (57%). Four patients had no chest CT abnormalities at baseline evaluation.",
            "Laboratory investigations were often normal, with the most frequent abnormalities being a mildly e elevated C-reactive protein (17.2\u00b120.0mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (33\u00b127s), lactate dehydrogenase (242\u00b173 U/L), and D-dimer (0.93\u00b11.43) (Table 1). The first pulmonary CT scan was r obtained 2\u00b12 days (range: 0\u20139) after the onset of symptoms. A total of 82 pulmonary CT scans were performed and each patient underwent an average of 4\u00b11 CT scans (range: 3-6) with a mean interval of 4\u00b11 days (range: 1-8 days) (Figure 1). All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized",
            "P period of 17\u00b14 days (range: 11-26 days).",
            "2. Pulmonary CT Evaluation Ground glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern (GGO with superimposed inter- and intralobular septal thickening) and consolidation were the most frequent CT findings in mild COVID-19",

            "21) the total CT score increased to approximately ten days after the onset of symptoms, and then gradually decreased (Figure 3a). The total CT score peaked at ten days after the onset of initial symptoms (Figure 3, calculated total CT Score, 6 at 10 days). Based on quartiles of patients and degree of lung involvement from day 0 to day 26 after disease onset, four stages were identified from the onset of initial symptoms (Figure 3b): Stage-1 (0-4 days, n=24); Stage-2 (5-8 days, n=17); Stage-3 (9-13 days, n=21); and Stage-4 (\u226514 days, n=20). In each group, the lower lobes were more inclined to be involved with higher CT scores. The CT scores of bilateral lower lobes were especially reaching significant differences than the corresponding upper/middle lobes in Stage-3 and Stage-4 (In Stage-3 and Stage-4, left lower lobe versus left upper lobe: 2 \u00b1 1 vs. 1 \u00b1 1, p=0.002, p=0.004, respectively; and right lower lobe versus right upper/middle lobe: 2 \u00b1 1 versus 1 \u00b1 1/1 \u00b1 1, p<0.001/=0.002, p=0.001/0.003, respectively. ). In Stage-2, the total CT score was greater than that of Stage-1 (6\u00b14 versus 2\u00b12, p=0.002) (Table 2). The distribution of lesions and major CT findings were compared at the four stages of recovery (Table 3). Overal, subpleural lesions were more common than central lung lesions. The majority of patients had bilateral lung involvement during the course of the diease. In Stage-1, GGO [18/24 (75%) of patients] with partial crazy-paving pattern [6/24 (25%) of patients] and consolidation [10/24 (42%) of patients] could be mostly found (Figures 4, 5). In Stage-2, the GGO [14/17 (82%) of patients] extended to more pulmonary lobes with more crazy-paving pattern [9/17 (53%) of patients] and consolidation [8/17 (47%) of patients]. In Stage-3, consolidation [19/21 (91%) of patients] was the main demonstration with the obviously deceased ratio of GGO [15/21 (71%) of patients] and crazys paving pattern [4/21 (19%) of patients]. In Stage-4, the consolidation [15/20 (75%) of patients] was partially absorbed without any crazy-paving pattern [0/20 (0%) of patients].",
            "The purpose of this study was determine the change in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. We studied patients with COVID-19 at e approximately 4 day intervals from the onset of disease until recovery. Patients with complicated pneumonia including severe respiratory distress (respiratory rate >30 breaths/min), requirement for r oxygen treatment or mechanical ventilation or SpO2<90% on room air were excluded. In patients without severe respiratory disease, the major pulmonary CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia were GGO, crazy-paving pattern and consolidation predominantly in subpleural locations in the lower",
            "P lobes. Chest CT abnormalities increased in number and severity of lesions in the first 10 weeks (peaking at apprxoimately 10 days). Subseqquently, there was a short plateau phase and a gradual decrease in abnormalities.",
            "In this study, the patients underwent multiple pulmonary CT scans (\u22653 times) providing reliable data",
            "In of the dynamic radiological pattern. The typical mild COVID-19 pneumonia mainly starts as small subpleural, unilateral or bilateral GGO in the lower lobes, which then develops into the crazy-paving pattern and subsequent consolidation. After more than two weeks, the lesions are gradually absorbed with residual GGO and subpleural parenchymal bands. In these patients who recovered from COVID19 pneumonia, 4 stages of lung involvement were defined on CT: 1. Early stage (0-4 days after onset of the initial symptom): In this stage, GGO was the main radiological demonstration (Figure 2a) distributed subpleurally in the lower lobes unilaterally or bilaterally. In our ochort, negative findings were revealed in four patients (total CT score=0) (Figure 3a). However, repeat pulmonary CT showed lung abnormalities in these 4 patients.",
            "2. Progressive stage (5-8 days after the onset of the initial symptom): In this stage, the infection rapidly aggravated and extended to a bilateral multi-lobe distribution with diffuse GGO, crazy-paving pattern and consolidation (Figure 5b).",
            "3. Peak stage (9-13 days after the onset of the initial symptom): In this stage, the involved area of the lungs slowly increased to the peak invovlment and dense consolidation became more prevalent. Findings included diffuse GGO, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and residual parenchymal bands.",
            "4. Absorption stage (\u226514 days after the onset of the initial symptom): In this stage, the infection was controlled and the consolidation was gradually absorbed. No crazy-paving pattern was present anymore. However, in this process, extensive GGO could be observed as the demonstration of the consolidation absorption (Figure 5d). Noticeably, in this study, no crazy-paving was observed in this stage, likely as a result of recovering. Based on the total CT score, the absorption stage extended s beyond 26 days (our last days of follow-up) from the onset of initial symptoms.",
            "Limitations of this study include the retrospective nature of our analysis and lack of a severe COVID-",
            "s 19 comparison group. Most of the patients with severe pneumonia and ARDS are still hospitalized [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Therefore, the analysis was limited to patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia.",
            "In summary, most patients who recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia showed greatest severity of e lung disease on CT at approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms. Chest CT signs of improvment began at approximately 14 days after the onset of initial symptoms.",
