        "abstract": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, was discovered in Wuhan, China, and has spread to different cities in China as well as to 24 other countries. The number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and reached 34,598 on 8 February 2020. In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA-ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), coefficient of determination (    R 2    ), and computing time. Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two countries, namely the USA and China. The outcomes also showed good performances.",

            "J. Clin. Med. 2020, 9, 674 requires more investigation. Most of the reported cases are in Wuhan city; therefore, at 10:00 am on 23 January 2020, Wuhan was put on lockdown, in which no people were allowed to go in or out, so, the authorities stopped all public transportation, including airports, trains, metro, and public buses to avoid the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, several cities in Hubei province were put on lockdown. However, many confirmed cases have been recorded in other Chinese cities and about 24 countries globally (up to 3 February 2020) but less than Wuhan city. On 30 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the human to human transmission of COVID-19. According to the CDC, the virus can be spread by the air, close personal contact, touching surfaces, or objects that contain viral particles, and rarely from fecal contamination. One of the serious problems of the COVID-19 is its incubation period which is up to 14 days as mentioned by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], and during this period it can spread to others. Moreover, in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], a Chinese team concludes that the median incubation period is 3 days and it ranged from 0 to 24 days, and the median age is 47.0 years. Therefore, the confirmed cases have increased daily, specifically in China. The spread of such a virus is very dangerous and requires more strict policies and plans, which have already been implemented in many Chinese cities, especially in Hubei province. Thus, it is very critical to forecast the confirmed cases in the upcoming days to enact the necessary protection plans.",
            "Zhao et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] proposed a mathematical model to estimate the real number of COVID-19 cases in the first half of January 2020, which had not been reported. They concluded that the number of unreported cases resulted in 469 cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. In addition, they estimated that after 17 January 2020, the cases had increased 21-fold. Nishiura et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] proposed an estimation model for the infection rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China using the data of 565 Japanese citizens who had been evacuated from Wuhan from 29 to 31 January 2020. They conclude that the estimated rate is 9.5%, and the death rate is 0.3% to 0.6%. However, the number of Japanese citizens who had been evacuated from Wuhan is small and insufficient to estimate the infection and death rate. Tang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] proposed a mathematical model to estimate the transmission risk of COVID-19. They concluded that the basic reproduction number could be 6.47. They also predicted the number of confirmed cases in seven days (23 to 29 January 2020). Moreover, they expected that the peak would be reached after two weeks (from 23 January 2020). In [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], data of 47 patients were used to estimate sustained human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The author concluded that the transmission is 0.4, and if the time of symptom to hospitalization is half of the tested data, the transmission will be only 0.012. In [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], the authors presented an estimation model for the risk of death from COVID-19. Their estimation results for two different scenarios are 5.1% and 8.4%. They also estimated the reproduction number for both two scenarios as 2.1 and 3.2, respectively. The estimation results showed that the COVID-19 might cause a pandemic.",
            "Previously, many studies were presented for forecasting some epidemics, for example, DeFelice et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] proposed a compartmental model to forecast spillover transmission risk and human West Nile virus (WNV) cases. The proposed model was applied using the historical data of WNY outbreaks of Long Island, New York, for 2001\u20132014. In [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], a comparison of several time series forecasting models is proposed to forecast hepatitis A virus infection. The authors used 13 years of data of Turkey to test four time series forecasting models, namely multi-layer perceptron (MLP), time-delay neural networks, radial basis function (RBF), and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The comparison outcomes showed that the MLP outperformed other models. In [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], the authors proposed a forecasting model based on ensemble adjustment Kalman filter for seasonal outbreaks of influenza. They evaluated the proposed model using the influenza seasons data of New York City for six years (2003\u20132008). In addition, Shaman et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] proposed weekly forecasts for seasonal influenza based on susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible, ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, and influenza-like illness. Moreover, in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], the authors employed a dynamic model with Bayesian inference to forecast the outbreaks of Ebola in several African countries, namely, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. Massad et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] proposed a mathematical model to analyze and forecast the infection of the SARS epidemic. They concluded that the reproduction number for two different",
            "communities, Hong Kong and Toronto, were 1.2 and 1.32, respectively. Ong et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] proposed a monitoring and forecasting model for influenza A (H1N1-2009). Furthermore, Nah et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] proposed a probability-based model to predict the spread of the MERS.",
            "The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] is widely applied in time series prediction and forecasting problems, and it showed good performance in many existing applications. It offers flexibility in determining nonlinearity in the time series data, as well as combining the properties of both artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy logic systems. It has been applied in various forecasting applications, for example, in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>], a stock price forecasting model was proposed using ANFIS and empirical mode decomposition. Chen et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] proposed a TAIEX time series forecasting model based on a hybrid of ANFIS and ordered weighted averaging (OWA). In [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], another time series forecasting method was presented for electricity prices based on ANFIS. Svalina et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] proposed an ANFIS based forecasting model for close price indices for a stock market for five days. Ekici and Aksoy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] presented an ANFIS based building energy consumption forecasting model. More so, ANFIS is also applied to forecast electricity loads [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Kumar et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] proposed an ANFIS based model to forecast return products. Ho and Tsai [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] applied ANFIS to forecast product development performance. However, estimating ANFIS parameters is a challenge that needs to be improved. Therefore, in previous studies, some individual swarm intelligence (SI) methods have been applied to the ANFIS parameters to enhance time series forecasting because these parameters have a significant effect on the performance of ANFIS. The SI methods include the particle swarm optimization (PSO) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>], social-spider optimization [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>], sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>], and multi-verse optimizer (MVO) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. For example, in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] SCA algorithm was applied to improve the ANFIS model to forecast oil consumption in three countries, namely, Canada, Germany, and Japan. In the same context, in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>], The MVO algorithm was used to enhance the ANFIS model to forecast oil consumption in two countries. In addition, in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] the PSO was used with ANFIS to predict biochar yield. However, individual SI algorithms may stock at local optima. Therefore, one solution is to apply hybrid SI algorithms to avoid this problem. In [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>], a hybrid of two SI algorithms, namely GA and SSA, was presented to improve the ANFIS model. The proposed new model called GA-SSA-ANFIS was applied to forecast crude oil prices for long-term time series data. However, the previously mentioned methods suffer from some limitations that can affect the performance of the forecasting output such as slow convergence and the ability to balance between exploration and exploitation phases can influence the quality of the final output. This motivated us to propose an alternative forecasting method dependent on the hybridization concept. This concept avoids the limitations of traditional SI techniques by combining the strengths of different techniques, and this produces new SI techniques that are better than traditional ones.",
            "In the current study, we propose an improved ANFIS model based on a modified flower pollination algorithm (FPA) using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). The FPA is an optimization algorithm proposed by Yang [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>], which was inspired by the flow pollination process of the flowering plants. The FPA was employed in various optimization applications, for example to estimate solar PV parameter [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>], solving sudoku puzzles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>], feature selection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>], antenna design [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>], and other applications [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. Moreover, SSA is also an optimization algorithm proposed by Mirjalili et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>] inspired by the behavior of salp chains. In recent years, the SSA was utilized to solve different optimization problems, such as feature selection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>], data classification [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>], image segmentation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>], and others [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>].",
            "The proposed method called FPASSA is a hybrid of FPA and SSA, in which the SSA is applied as a local search method for FPA. The proposed FPASSA starts by receiving the historical COVID-19 dataset. Then a set of solutions is generated where each of them represents the value for the parameters of the ANFIS model. Then the quality of each solution is calculated using the fitness value, and the solution that has the best fitness value is chosen to represent the best solution. Then the probability of each solution is computed. Then the current solution will be updated, either using global or local strategy in FPA. However, in the case of local strategy, the operators of SSA or FPA will be used according to the probability of the fitness value for each solution. The process of updating the solutions is repeated until reaching the stop condition, and the best parameter configurations are used to forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.",
            "The main contribution points of the current study are as follows: 1. We propose an efficient forecasting model to forecast the confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in China for the upcoming ten days based on previously confirmed cases.",

            "The principles of the ANFIS are given in this section. The ANFIS model links the fuzzy logic and neural networks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. It generates a mapping between the input and output by applying IF-THEN rules (it is also called Takagi\u2013Sugeno inference model). Figure 1 illustrates the ANFIS model where, y and x define the inputs to Layer 1 whereas, O1i is its output of node i that is computed as follows: O1i = \u03bcAi (x), i = 1, 2, O1i = \u03bcBi\u22122 (y), i = 3, 4",
            "where \u03bc denotes the generalized Gaussian membership functions. Ai and Bi define the membership values of \u03bc. \u03b1i and \u03c1i denote the premise parameters set.",
            "The output of Layer 2 (it is also known as the firing strength of a rule) is calculated as follows: O2i = \u03bcAi (x) \u00d7 \u03bcBi\u22122 (y)",

            "where ri, qi, and pi define the consequent parameters of the node i. Layer 5 contains only one node; its output is computed as: O5 = \u2211 wi fi (6)",
            "Flower Pollination Algorithm is an optimization method proposed by Yang [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. It simulates the transfer of flowers\u2019 pollen by pollinators in nature. This algorithm utilizes the two types of pollination (i.e., self-pollination and cross-pollination). In self-pollination, the pollination occurs with no pollinators, whereas, in cross-pollination, the pollens are moved between different plants. In more detail, the self-pollination can be represented as a local pollination while the cross-pollination can be called global pollination.",

In some cases, insects can fly with different distance steps for a long space; therefore, Levy fly distribution is applied to simulate this movement.",

            "SSA is an optimization technique introduced by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]. It simulates the Salps\u2019 behavior in nature. This behavior is called salp chain. The mathematical model of SSA begins by splinting its population into a leader group and followers group. The leader is the front salp, whereas, the followers are the other salps. The search space is determined in n-dimensions with n variables. Equation (10) works to update the salps\u2019 positions.",

            "This section explains the proposed FPASSA-ANFIS method. It is a time series method for forecasting the confirmed cases of the COVID-19, as given in Figure 2.",
            "The FPASSA-ANFIS utilizes the improved FPA to train the ANFIS model by optimizing its parameters. The FPASSA-ANFIS contains five layers as the classic ANFIS model. Layer 1 contains the input variables (the historical COVID-19 confirmed cases). Whereas Layer 5 produces the forecasted values. In the learning phase, the FPASSA is used to select the best weights between Layer 4 and Layer 5.",
            "The FPASSA-ANFIS starts by formatting the input data in a time series form. In our case, the autocorrelation function (ACF) was considered. ACF is one of the methods applied to find patterns in the data; it presents information about the correlation between points separated by various time lags. Therefore, in this paper, the variables with ACF greater than 0.2 are considered i.e., 5-lags.",
            "Besides, the training data contains 75% of the dataset, whereas the testing data contains 25% of them. The number of clusters is defined by the fuzzy c-mean (FCM) method to construct the ANFIS model.",
            "The parameters of the ANFIS model are prepared by the FPASSA algorithm. In the training phase, the calculation error (as in Equation (13)) between the real data and the predicted data is used to evaluate the parameters\u2019 quality.",
            "where T is the real data, and P is the predicted data. Ns is the sample length. The smaller values of the objective function indicate good ANFIS\u2019s parameter.",
            "On the other hand, the updating phase of the followers\u2019 positions in the SSA algorithm is applied to improve the global pollination phase in the FPA algorithm. In this improvement, there is a random variable (r) used to switch between both phases. If r > 0.5, then the operators of the SSA is used; otherwise, the operators of the FPA are used. In general, The FPASSA starts by constructing the population (X); afterward, the objective function is calculated for each solution. The solution with the lowest error value is saved to the next iteration. This sequence is repeated until meeting the stop condition, which in this paper, is the maximum number of iterations. Then the best solution is passed to train the parameters of the ANFIS model.",
            "After finishing the training phase, the testing phase is started with the best solution to compute the final output. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing the real data with the predicted data using the performance measures. Finally, the FPASSA produces a foretasted value for confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China in the next day. The steps of the proposed FPASSA are presented in Algorithm 1.",
