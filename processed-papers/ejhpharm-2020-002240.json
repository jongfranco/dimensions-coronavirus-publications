It seems threatening situation with the novel coro- that men are more likely to be affected, navirus that was first reported in China at and the median age range of patients is the end of January. Cities in China have been locked down and international travel has been curtailed. Many travellers have found themselves trapped, both unable to return home and at risk of a potentially fatal illness.",
            "As I write this in early February, the virus has now infected some 20 000 people worldwide, with over 400 fatalities reported. The majority of cases have been in Wuhan, China, where it originated, though more are being identified across a dozen other countries.",
            "Many of you will read this editorial in the congress edition of European Journal of Hospital Pharmacy, where you will have the benefit of hindsight. It is possible that the situation will be far worse, but of course, the outbreak may well have been contained due to urgent action in many countries; the trajectory is impossible to predict. The virus has been compared with the severe acute respiratory syndrome",
            "49\u201359 years. The clinical symptoms are similar to viral pneumonia and can be mild to severe. Most at present appear to have mild illness. Approximately 20% of cases progress to severe disease, more likely in older people or those with underlying health conditions.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]",
            "The most common symptoms are fever, cough and dyspnoea. Other less common symptoms include myalgia, fatigue, sputum production, confusion, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, haemoptysis, diarrhoea and nausea/ vomiting. Approximately 90% of patients present with more than one symptom, and 15% of patients present with fever, cough and dyspnoea. It is thought that some patients may be asymptomatic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]",
            "So what does this mean for hospital pharmacists? Pharmacists will need to keep up to date with developments, and it might be sensible to appoint a staff member to be a point of reference, ideally",
            "In general, pharmacists can be reassuring to a wider public as it is likely that most cases have already been either in China or in contact with someone who have travelled to China. That situation might change if an epidemic takes off. In terms of protection, there is little reliable evidence that reuseable face masks are of benefit, and for hand hygiene, soap and hot water remain the sensible option. Members of the public who are concerned that they may be developing an infection must be instructed to avoid using general practitioner practices or emergency departments but instead to contact the health authorities by phone.",
