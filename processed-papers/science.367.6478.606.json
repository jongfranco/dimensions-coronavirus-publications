The largest plague of desert locusts in decades advances across the Horn of Africa, consuming crops and threatening famine. Using sensors and a submersible robot, scientists in Antarctica report the first direct evidence that warm ocean temperatures around the rapidly retreating Thwaites Glacier could destabilize the key ice sheet, drive further melting, and increase global sea levels. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative announces new grants for work to find treatments for rare diseases. The U.S. Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative gets its first formal director. Some researchers in Colombia call for a little-known molecular biologist appointed in December 2019 as the country's first ever science minister to resign over reports that she treated cancer patients with a fungal extract, without running a formal clinical trial.",
