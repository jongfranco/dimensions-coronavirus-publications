        "abstract": "Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is primarily associated with common cold in children, elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Outbreaks caused by HCoV-NL63 are rare. Here we report a cluster of HCoV-NL63 cases with severe lower respiratory tract infection that arose in Guangzhou, China, in 2018. Twenty-three hospitalized children were confirmed to be HCoV-NL63 positive, and most of whom were hospitalized with severe pneumonia or acute bronchitis. Whole genomes of HCoV-NL63 were obtained using next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic and single amino acid polymorphism analyses showed that this outbreak was associated with two subgenotypes (C3 and B) of HCoV-NL63. Half of patients were identified to be related to a new subgenotype C3. One unique amino acid mutation at I507 L in spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) was detected, which segregated this subgenotype C3 from other known subgenotypes. Pseudotyped virus bearing the I507 L mutation in RBD showed enhanced entry into host cells as compared to the prototype virus. This study proved that HCoV-NL63 was undergoing continuous mutation and has the potential to cause severe lower respiratory disease in humans.",

            "Clinical information and co-infections of patients infected with HCoV-NL63<br/><br/>Between 2016 and 2017, there were only three HCoVNL63 positive pediatric patients detected in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. However, in 2018 there was a sharp increase of HCov-NL-63 infection. Twenty-three cases were detected in 2018, 20 of which were detected from July to September 2018 (Figure 1A and B). The clinical information of the HCoV-NL63 infected patients was summarized in Figure 1(C). The majority of patients who were infected with HCoV-NL63 had pneumonia, and two patients had severe pneumonia. Their ages ranged from 5 months to 5 years old. Clinical manifestation of these patients included cough, fever, coryza, shortness of breath, wheezing and abnormal pulmonary breath sound. Samples from HCoV-NL63 positive patients were also tested for other 14 common respiratory pathogens. Of the 23 patients, 19 (82.6%) of them were infected only with HCoV-NL63, while 4 (17.4%) patients were found to be co-infected with other pathogens, such as RSV, HBoV and EV. These data clearly showed that most of the patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were caused by HCoV-NL63 but not co-infected with other pathogens. HCoV-NL63 infection presented here preferentially caused severe lower respiratory tract infection rather than upper respiratory tract infection. No evidence of injuries, COPD, immune diseases, chronic diseases, metabolic disorders et al were detected in these patients. Comparison of clinical characteristics including age, co-infection and clinical symptoms showed no obvious differences between different subgenotypes infections (Table S1). Considering the increasing case number and the proportion of HCoV-NL63 single infection, this should be a smallscale outbreak associated with HCoV-NL63 in Guangzhou, China, in 2018 indicating HCoV-NL63 is a more important human pathogen than is commonly believed."

            "Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is primarily associated with common cold in children, elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Outbreaks caused by HCoV-NL63 are rare. Here we report a cluster of HCoV-NL63 cases with severe lower respiratory tract infection that arose in Guangzhou, China, in 2018. Twenty-three hospitalized children were confirmed to be HCoV-NL63 positive, and most of whom were hospitalized with severe pneumonia or acute bronchitis. Whole genomes of HCoV-NL63 were obtained using next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic and single amino acid polymorphism analyses showed that this outbreak was associated with two subgenotypes (C3 and B) of HCoV-NL63. Half of patients were identified to be related to a new subgenotype C3. One unique amino acid mutation at I507 L in spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) was detected, which segregated this subgenotype C3 from other known subgenotypes. Pseudotyped virus bearing the I507 L mutation in RBD showed enhanced entry into host cells as compared to the prototype virus. This study proved that HCoV-NL63 was undergoing continuous mutation and has the potential to cause severe lower respiratory disease in humans.",

The SARSCoV pandemic infected over 8000 people worldwide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. As of 9 September 2019, 2458 MERS cases with 848 deaths (34.5% mortality) were reported to World Health Organization (WHO).

However, in 2018 there was a sharp increase of HCov-NL-63 infection. Twenty-three cases were detected in 2018, 20 of which were detected from July to September 2018 (Figure 1A and B). The clinical information of the HCoV-NL63 infected patients was summarized in Figure 1(C). The majority of patients who were infected with HCoV-NL63 had pneumonia, and two patients had severe pneumonia. Their ages ranged from 5 months to 5 years old. Clinical manifestation of these patients included cough, fever, coryza, shortness of breath, wheezing and abnormal pulmonary breath sound. Samples from HCoV-NL63 positive patients were also tested for other 14 common respiratory pathogens. Of the 23 patients, 19 (82.6%) of them were infected only with HCoV-NL63, while 4 (17.4%) patients were found to be co-infected with other pathogens, such as RSV, HBoV and EV. These data clearly showed that most of the patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were caused by HCoV-NL63 but not co-infected with other pathogens. HCoV-NL63 infection presented here preferentially caused severe lower respiratory tract infection rather than upper respiratory tract infection. No evidence of injuries, COPD, immune diseases, chronic diseases, metabolic disorders et al were detected in these patients. Comparison of clinical characteristics including age, co-infection and clinical symptoms showed no obvious differences between different subgenotypes infections (Table S1).

Genotype A was further divided into subtypes A1, A2 and A3. Genotype C contained three subgenotypes C1, C2 and C3. We also performed phylogenetic analyses based on complete genome, orf1ab and spike genes, respectively (Figure 4). Phylogenetic trees based on orf1ab, spike genes and complete genome showed similar topologies with seven sub-genotypes, which further confirmed the phylogenetic structure and supported a new subgenotype C3 circulating in Guangzhou, China (Figure 4).

Bayesian skyline plot analyses were estimated to depict the relative genetic diversity of HCoV-NL63 in spike gene over time (Figure S2), HCoV-NL63 showed moderate increase in genetic diversity between 1989 and 2015, while showed slight decrease in 2018 due to the limited number of update HCoVNL63 sequences.

Of note, one signature amino acid mutation at 507 L of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) was detected in all strains of subgenotype C3 which segregated from other different subgenotypes. In addition, amino acid alignment analysis of HCoV-NL63 partial spike protein indicated that most of the HCoV-NL63 detected here had the special mutation I507 L which belongs to subgenotype C3 (Figure S3). This mutation may be associated with change in virulence or transmission of HCoV-NL63 in humans.",

The infectivity of pseudotyped HCoV-NL63 was detected by luciferase reaction in Huh7 cells. Cell control serves as the negative control to determine background. As showed in Figure 7(A and B), in both lentiviral and VSV system mutant pseudotyped (507 L) showed increased viral entry into susceptible cells compared to WT. The higher viral entry may be associated with increased transmission and case number in human in South China. Sequences alignment between subgenotype C3 and B indicated only one SNP (E471D) was located in RBD region. To directly compare viral entry between subgenotypes B and C3, pseudotype bearing E471D mutation was prepared. No difference was observed between E471D mutant and WT in Figure 7(C and D). The crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 RBD complexed with its receptor ACE2 has been published previously [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] and three key RBMs (receptor binding motifs) were defined as RBM1 (residues 493\u2013513), RBM2 (residues 531\u2013541) and RBM3 (residues 585\u2013 590). The mutation I507 L lied in RBM1 and may promote viral entry during infection. More epidemiological surveys should be performed. Discovery of the new subgenotype emphasized the risk of increased pathogenicity of HCoV-NL63 as evolution."

This represented a significant increase in case numbers of HCoV-NL63 infection as compared to last 10 years in the corresponding period of time indicating a small-scale outbreak of severe respiratory illness caused by HCoVNL63. In addition, phylogenetic and recombination analyses demonstrated that two subgenotypes (C3 and B) of HCoV-NL63 were associated with severe lower respiratory tract disease and a new subgenotype was first discovered and showed different evolutionary trends. Previous reports showed that HCoV-NL63 infections in China are distributed across the whole year without an obvious seasonal distribution or presence of clusters in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>].

The new subgenotype circulating in Guangzhou primarily caused LRTI in hospitalized children and showed the sign of fast transmission. Based on previous reports, HCoV-NL63 was mainly divided into three genotypes, including A, B and C. However, as the continuous identification of HCoV-NL63 related sequences, the genotyping classification cannot meet the requirement for sequence analysis, especially for discovery of new subgenotype. Here, we divided all the HCoV-NL63 available into seven subgenotypes (subgenotypes A1, A2, A3, B, C1, C2 and C3). The subgenotype-specific SAP analysis of spike protein also supported this classification. Comparison of clinical characteristics between subgenotype C3 and B infected patients showed no significant difference. More genotype-specific cases were required to explore the relationship between clinical symptoms and genotype or co-infection.",

As the continuous transmission and evolution, the change of pathogenicity is inevitable. Here, the new subgenotype of HCoV-NL63 causing LRI appeared to be far more infectious due to the unique mutation I507L in RBD. Considering HCoVNL63 and SARS-CoV share the same cellular receptor, a better understanding of pathogenicity and epidemiology of newHCoV-NL63 subgenotype is of particular importance in view of potential enhanced virulence or transmission. Epidemiological and phylogenetic studies are required periodically to evaluate the risk of an epidemic caused by newHCoV-NL63."
