        "abstract": "Porcine diarrhea disease in newborn and suckling piglets due to infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a leading cause of economic loss in the pig industry globally. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the host innate immune response to PEDV infection. The expression dynamics of antiviral genes (e.g., RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12) in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells were analyzed following PEDV stimulation. The results showed that the expression of antiviral genes (e.g., PKR, OAS1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1) were significantly reduced within 0\u20134 h post-infection (P < 0.05). However, all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h (P < 0.05), and cytopathic changes were observed during this time. The expression of RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 were significantly and positively correlated to each other during the entire infection (P < 0.01). The results suggested that the RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 genes may play an important role in PEDV infection in piglets. Initially, PEDV displayed cellular invasion by inhibiting IFN-\u03b1 transcription and interfering with the antiviral function of PKR, OAS1, and Mx2, ultimately induced an intense inflammatory response. The relationship between antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines with PEDV infection at the cellular level provides a reference for studying the mechanism of resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.",

        "discussion": [
            "Recently, the relationship between PEDV infection and host natural immunity has become an issue of keen interest throughout the world. A systematic understanding of the interaction between PEDV and innate immunity can provide us with new strategies for the preventive treatment of PED. PEDV is positive sense single-stranded RNA virus coated with a capsid for which the pathogenesis is associated with the binding of the S1 subunit region of the virus-encoded S protein to the receptor gene (APN) expressed on porcine small intestinal epithelial cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Then PEDV enters the host cell via membrane fusion, and begins to replicate and proliferate in the host cell, producing double-strained RNA (dsRNA) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Studies have shown that RIG-1 is a receptor that recognizes viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Moreover, RIG-1-like receptors (RLRs) bind to viral dsRNA by recognizing pathogen-related molecular patterns. In addition, the N-terminal CARD structure of RLRs can interact with the downstream adaptor protein, IPS1, to activate the downstream TANK-binding kinases, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, activate the transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) to induce type 1 IFN production [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. At present, substantial progress has been made in the study of PEDV-mediated antagonization of the natural innate immune response. There are two main viral escape mechanisms: [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] blocking the RIG-1/IPS1 signaling pathway by hiding its dsRNA; and [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] encoding an IFN antagonist protein to attack the transmission of molecular signals in antiviral signaling pathways [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]."

PEDV is a coronavirus, a singlestranded positive-sense RNA virus, which is recognized and activates by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) -like receptors I. RIG-I activation induces the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) to regulate the expression of a series of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that stimulate target cells to produce specific antiviral proteins (e.g., double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase [PKR], 2-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthase 1 [OAS1], and myxovirus resistance proteins [Mx]) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor [TNF-\u03b1] and interleukin 6 [IL-6]) are also produced to mediate various inflammatory responses and exert antiviral effects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Therefore, further exploration of the host innate immune response following PEDV infection can provide a theoretical basis for the study of piglet resistance to PEDV infection.",
            "In the present study, porcine small intestinal epithelial cells were used as an in vitro model to investigate PEDV infection. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect differences in the expression of the RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 genes at various time points post-infection. In addition, the mRNA levels of some inflammatory factors was also determined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular regulation related to the host innate immune system that are mediated by PEDV infection, and provide a theoretical basis for studying the mechanism of resistance to PEDV infection in piglets."

            "significantly (P < 0.05), and expression of the OAS1 gene was extremely significantly different (P < 0.01). Subsequently, the mRNA levels of RIG-1, PKR, and Mx1 gene began to increase at 12 h post-infection, whereas the expression of OAS1 continued to significantly decline (P < 0.01). Finally, the expressions of all antiviral genes were highly significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01), and peaked at 24 h.",

            "correlation between the transcription levels of these five genes. The results were presented in Table 1. The transcriptions of five antiviral genes were found to be significantly and positively correlated with each other (P < 0.01).",
            "We next examined the differences in the levels of transcriptions of some important immune factors in IPEC-J2 cells within 24 h following PEDV infection (Figure 4). It was found that the expressions of IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 significantly decreased 4 h after infection, but IL-12 gene increased significantly (P < 0.01). After infection for 12 h to 24 h, the expressions of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12 began to increase continuously, and the levels of transcriptions of these inflammatory factors peaked at 24 h."

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "Recently, the relationship between PEDV infection and host natural immunity has become an issue of keen interest throughout the world. A systematic understanding of the interaction between PEDV and innate immunity can provide us with new strategies for the preventive treatment of PED. PEDV is positive sense single-stranded RNA virus coated with a capsid for which the pathogenesis is associated with the binding of the S1 subunit region of the virus-encoded S protein to the receptor gene (APN) expressed on porcine small intestinal epithelial cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Then PEDV enters the host cell via membrane fusion, and begins to replicate and proliferate in the host cell, producing double-strained RNA (dsRNA) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Studies have shown that RIG-1 is a receptor that recognizes viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Moreover, RIG-1-like receptors (RLRs) bind to viral dsRNA by recognizing pathogen-related molecular patterns. In addition, the N-terminal CARD structure of RLRs can interact with the downstream adaptor protein, IPS1, to activate the downstream TANK-binding kinases, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, activate the transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) to induce type 1 IFN production [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. At present, substantial progress has been made in the study of PEDV-mediated antagonization of the natural innate immune response. There are two main viral escape mechanisms: [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] blocking the RIG-1/IPS1 signaling pathway by hiding its dsRNA; and [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] encoding an IFN antagonist protein to attack the transmission of molecular signals in antiviral signaling pathways [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>].",
            "In the present study, we found that although no significant differences were observed, the expression of RIG-1 began to decrease within 4 h after PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells. In addition, IFN-\u03b1 transcribed by cells was also substantially reduced at this time point, which may be the result of PEDV antagonizing the host innate immune response, suggesting that the virus began to invade the small intestinal cells 0\u20134 h after challenge. Our study showed that PEDV infected IPEC-J2 cells by interfering with the RIG-1-mediated signaling pathway to inhibit IFN-\u03b1 transcription, thereby perpetuating an extended infection in the host. Subsequently, the level of RIG-1, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b2 gene expression began to increase at 12\u201324 h postinfection, and obvious lesions were observed simultaneously, indicating that host innate immunity plays an important role in immune regulation at this time point.",
            "When IFN-I (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) is secreted extracellularly through various methods, it binds to IFNAR1/2 and activates the Janus kinases/Signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/Stat) signaling pathway, which in turn induces transcriptional activation of ISGs. ISGs are effector molecules that mediate cellular innate immune responses to viral infections, including PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2. PKR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that can be activated by dsRNA produced by viral replication, which can inactive the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF-2\u03b1, resulting in blocking the entry of viral or host mRNA into the ribosome to form the initiation complex [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. OAS1 is an interferon-induced antiviral protease that can recognize dsRNA and activate endonuclease (RNaseL), to degrade both viral mRNA and cellular RNA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Studies have shown that porcine OAS1 can effectively inhibit the infectious activity of Japanese encephalitis virus, pseudorabies virus, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Mx protein is induced by IFN-I and IFN-II and is associated with intracellular vesicle transportation and intracellular homeostasis. Moreover, it exhibits extensive anti-RNA virus activity. Sun et al successfully constructed an Mx1 or Mx2 over-expressing monkey kidney epithelial cell line, MARC-145, and found that both could effectively inhibit the replication of PEDV, albeit Mx2 displays a stronger anti-PEDV activity compared to Mx1 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Our study found that the levels of PKR, OAS1, and Mx2 expression decreased at 0\u20134 h after the attack, indicating that PEDV may interfere with antiviral gene expression and inhibit the cellular innate immune response. The expression of PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 peaked at 24 h. In addition, in IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV, the expressions of the RIG-1, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2 genes were significantly and positively correlated to each other, likely because these genes are induced through the Jak/Stat signaling pathway, and their expression profiles are simulations similar in response to invasion of the same virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Thus, our findings suggested that these five antiviral genes interacted to regulate PEDV infection.",
            "Inflammation mediated by the innate immune system is also an important indicator by which host disease resistance can be measured. Therefore, research based on proinflammatory cytokines is helpful for clarifying the pathogenesis of diseases and the associated host immune mechanisms against infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 have antiviral, antitumor, antiparasitic, and immune regulatory effects. TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL12 are important cytokines involved in the immune response and mediating the inflammatory response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In this study, the levels of proinflammatory cytokine transcriptions were monitored and the cytopathic conditions were also observed to explore the immune status of the cells following viral infection. The results showed that no obvious lesions were observed in the cells at 4 h after infection, and there was no significant difference in the expressions of other inflammatory factors, except IL-12 at this time point. The expressions of IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 were also inhibited, indicating that the cellular inflammatory reaction was minor at this time point. At 12 h post-infection, the cells began to shrink and the lesions were evident. At 24 h, the cellular pathological changes were the most severe. In addition, the levels of inflammatory factor transcriptions increased continuously from 12 to 24 h after infection, and the expression levels peaked at 24 h, indicating that the inflammatory reaction of the cells was the most intense at this time point.",
            "Cao et al reported that no pathological changes were observed in IPEC-J2 cells with PEDV infection for 72 h, and the expression of RIG-1 and IFN-\u03b2 was inhibited continuously [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. In the present study, we found that the expression of antiviral genes (e.g., PKR, OAS1, and Mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1) were significantly reduced within 0\u20134 h post-infection. However, all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h, and cytopathic changes were observed during this period. These results suggested that the expressions of the antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines are positively correlated with the severity of the cytopathic effect following PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells. Activation of these genes might be a hallmark of PEDV infection.",
            "In this study, we preliminarily investigated the expression patterns of the antiviral genes RIG, PKR, OAS1, Mx1, and Mx2, which are involved in the host innate immune mechanisms during PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells. We then analyzed the inflammatory reaction mediated by PEDV infection. Our future research will involve constructing an antiviral gene overexpressing or knock-out IPEC-J2 cell line, and evaluating its resistance to PEDV. Such findings will provide a more direct theoretical basis for the development of genetic breeding strategies against swine epidemic diarrhea in the future."
