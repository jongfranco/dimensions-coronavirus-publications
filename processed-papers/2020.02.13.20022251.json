The peak of the epidemic is different in three regions, Wuhan, Hubei province except Wuhan, and mainland China except Hubei. In two regions except Wuhan, the peak of the epidemic passed ten days ago.

An epidemic can be described by a Gaussian around the peak of the epidemic. The 2019 epidemic, which is referred as JpnInf2019 in the following, has the smallest deviation from a Gaussian and has a shorter epidemic period. As shown by a solid line in Fig. 2, the epidemic of JpnInf2019 can be described by a Gaussian with a peak at 3.65 week and the number of new",

Although the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is common as a descriptive term for a Gaussian, the term \"decay constant\" is used to simplify the formula. FWHM equals to 1.67 \"decay constant\".",

By assuming the decay constant to be 18 days which was that of JpnInf2019, the reported data points are fitted well by a Gaussian with a peak of February 27 and a peak value of 20,000 people, as shown in Fig. 3.

However, social conditions differ greatly depending on the region. For example, the city of Wuhan has been blocked from outside since January 23. In addition, although the rush construction of new hospitals has been carried out, owing to an extremely large number of potential infections, there is a possibility that the ability of the examination and treatment by medical institutions has not caught up. These circumstances cause a serious deviation of the reported number of infected people from the actual and can also affect the epidemic.
