KSA also suspended the recently introduced e-Visa program, placed ban on inbound travel of persons from COVID19 affected countries, and restrictions on travel of GCC citizens who have traveled to COVID-19 affected countries.",

            "tourism performing umra. Because the Umrah crowd size in ritual sites are smaller than that during Hajj, more elderly and disabled persons would be seen during Umrah. Beginning January 2020, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Haj and Umrah made effective the new health insurance policy which will be applicable once the pilgrim arrives in the Kingdom. Under the insurance cover, Umrah pilgrims can avail insurance policy to visit government or private hospitals in the Kingdom and will have to present only a passport number. Moreover, comprehensive insurance cover can be helpful in case of flight delays or cancellations, death and in repatriating the deceased, or in accidents and disasters. Put together, Umrah pilgrims may be at high risk of person-to-person transmission of SARS CoV-2 both among pilgrims and with non-pilgrims, should they acquire SARS-COV2, and carrying the infection further to their home countries unknowingly. Continuation of inbound Umrah travels to KSA would have helped SARS-COV2 to reach currently unaffected countries.",
            "KSA\u2019s decision to suspend Umrah pilgrimage services comes with a huge cost to the economy of KSA including the airline, transport and hospitality sector, and adversely affects the employment and livelihood of the native and immigrant workforce of holy cities of KSA. The impact on personal finance of pilgrims in all 180+ countries due to cancellations, and on transportation and hospitality sectors that cater to pilgrims in home countries would also be significant. Above all, pilgrimage is lifetime dream of people of Muslim faith, and many save up money for their entire lives to achieve their eternal dream. Many even express preference to die at the holy sites and consider it as a blessing. Therefore, the emotional and mental challenges experienced by would-be pilgrims who are affected by the suspension are unquantifiable. By cancelling a religious event of significance to the Muslim world, KSA also has to manage diplomatic challenges with large pilgrim volume countries and manage requests for exemptions."
