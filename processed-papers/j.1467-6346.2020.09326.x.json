            "In his opening remarks, AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat focused on the challenges facing the African continent, ranging from conflicts to threats of terrorism and locust invasion in Ethiopia and Kenya.",
            "\u201cThe persistence of terrorism threatens the collapse of some member states and must be eradicated. Women and children remain the biggest victims of conflict,\u201d he said.",
            "The chairperson said African countries need to mobilise \u201cour energy to deal with these challenges\u201d.",
            "The outgoing AU chairperson, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, presented the achievements and efforts made over the past year in African security, peace and development. He handed over the baton to the new AU chairperson, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
            "Ramaphosa said that addressing the challenges of women\u2019s empowerment, gender-based violence, and the conflicts in Libya and South Sudan will be high on the agenda of AU in 2020. (FBC 9/2)",
            "South Africa, as chair of the AU, will also champion infrastructure development as the key to unlocking economic development and industrialisation on the continent.",

            "\u201cAs all developing countries, we cannot sate our continent\u2019s infrastructure hunger with our limited resources, and it goes without saying that this presents a major investment opportunity for our respective countries,\u201d said Ramaphosa.",
            "According to the AfDB, the financing gap is between $68bn and $108bn.",
            "\u201cThis means we must think creatively and expansively about how we can close this gap. We also must be open to various financing models, such as public-private partnerships, commercial loans, development funding, and sovereign bonds,\u201d said Ramaphosa.",
            "Infrastructure development in the continent will also provide fertile ground for the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA). The implementation of this seminal agreement will boost intra-Africa trade, reignite industrialisation, and pave the way for the meaningful integration of Africa into global value chains and the global economy.",
