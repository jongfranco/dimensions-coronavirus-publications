        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 2,000\ndeaths as of 20 February 2020 worldwide but there is no approved effective drug. The &lt;a&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt; spike (S) glycoprotein is a key drug target\ndue to its indispensable function for viral infection and fusion with ACE2 as a\nreceptor. To facilitate the drug discovery and development with S protein as\ndrug target, various computational techniques were used in this study to\nevaluate the binding mechanisms between S protein and its acceptor ACE2. Impressively, SARS-CoV-2\nS protein has higher affinity binding to ACE2 at two different \u201cup\u201d angles of\nRBD than SARS-CoV S protein to ACE2 at the same angles. The energy\ndecomposition analysis showed that more interactions formed between SARS-CoV-2\nS protein and ACE2, which may partially account for its higher infectiousness\nthan SARS-CoV. In addition, we found that 52.2\u00b0 is a starting accessible \u201cup\u201d\nangle of the BRD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to bind ACE2, demonstrating that BRD\nis not necessary to be fully opened in order to bind ACE2. We hope that this\nwork will be helpful for the design of effective SARS-CoV-2 S protein\ninhibitors to address the ongoing public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
