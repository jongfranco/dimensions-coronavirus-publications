        "abstract": "Cancer is the first cause of death by disease in childhood globally. The most frequent types of cancers in children and adolescents are leukemias, followed by brain and central nervous system tumors and lymphomas. The recovery rate of cancer in children is around 80% in developed countries and up to 30% in developing countries. Some of the main causes of complications in children and adolescents with cancer are respiratory viral infections, mainly in bone marrow-transplanted patients. Respiratory viruses have been detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage or nasal wash specimens from cancer patients with or without respiratory illness symptoms. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is within the ten most common viruses that are encountered in samples from pediatric patients with underlying oncology conditions. In most of cases, HMPV is found as the only viral agent, but co-infection with other viruses or with bacterial agents has also been reported. The discrepancies between the most prevalent viral agents may be due to the different populations studied or the range of viral agents tested. Some of the cases of infection with HMPV in cancer patients have been fatal, especially in those who have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This review seeks to show a general view of the participation of HMPV in respiratory illness as a complication of cancer in childhood and adolescence.",

            "Pediatric oncology patients are more susceptible infections due, in most cases, to the neutropenia that results from medication.<br/><br/>HMPV infections in patients with hematological conditions have been documented, but their impact in childhood is not clear because the research has involved children and adults or only adults. This review shows the respiratory viral infections that can be originated to HMPV infection exclusively in pediatric oncology patients. The distribution of HMPV among other viruses in otherwise healthy children and adolescents is reported to be 6\u201340% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], which is greater than that of the pediatric population with underlying cancer, whose HMPV distribution is 3.3\u201313.5% (as seen in this review). These data should be taken carefully because the combined number of patients in the cancer group was small (n = 3867), and the number of HMPV infections may have been underestimated. Interestingly, in pediatric oncology patients, 2.9\u201310% of the HMPV infections were detected in episodes of ARI; however in children going through febrile episodes, HMPV infection was found in up to 44% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] and 51% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] of cases. This difference is probably because HMPV infections could be asymptomatic because about 60% of the fever episodes in neutropenic patients do not show other signs or symptoms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]."

        "methodology": [
            "Two researchers (C.M.R. and M.R.B.L) independently performed a search in PubMed with different combinations of the terms HMPV, metapneumovirus, and respiratory viral infection, as well as cancer children, leukemia children, and pediatric oncology. As a result, a total of 811 papers were found. A second search with the terms HMPV, metapneumovirus, and transplant cancer retrieved 61 papers. After reading the abstracts, reviews and duplicates were eliminated. Papers in which the subjects of the studies were only adults and those in which HMPV was not surveyed were also eliminated. Papers written in English and Spanish were all considered. In the end, the number of papers that met the established characteristics was 30. During the process of writing of the review, four more papers were included."

Furthermore, patients with pediatric cancer and those with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are subjects to community-acquired respiratory virus infections, which are a cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. During the Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-4), it was recommended to screen for respiratory viruses in patients with respiratory symptoms. The identification of influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), and human parainfluenza virus are the priorities. Meanwhile, the identification of human enterovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and human adenovirus should be accomplished if the above-mentioned tests had negative results or when there is a risk of contagion [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].",

This review shows the respiratory viral infections that can be originated to HMPV infection exclusively in pediatric oncology patients. The distribution of HMPV among other viruses in otherwise healthy children and adolescents is reported to be 6\u201340% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], which is greater than that of the pediatric population with underlying cancer, whose HMPV distribution is 3.3\u201313.5% (as seen in this review). These data should be taken carefully because the combined number of patients in the cancer group was small (n = 3867), and the number of HMPV infections may have been underestimated. Interestingly, in pediatric oncology patients, 2.9\u201310% of the HMPV infections were detected in episodes of ARI; however in children going through febrile episodes, HMPV infection was found in up to 44% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] and 51% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] of cases.

Actually, the treatment with ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) had an unfavorable outcome in other cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>].
