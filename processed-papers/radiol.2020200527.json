            "Infections by COVID-19 continue to increase in China and worldwide. The betacoronavirus was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. As of February 24, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports 78,811 laboratory-confirmed cases, including more than 2200 cases outside of China (1). Public health officials had thought the rate of new cases was slowing, but changes to diagnostic criteria led to an increased rate of new cases. In the past several weeks, many published studies, case series, and case reports have increased our knowledge of the clinical and radiographic manifestations of this infection. The purpose of this summary is to provide an update regarding recent information relevant to the radiologist.",
            "Clinical presentation. Most patients with lower respiratory tract infection caused by COVID-19 present with fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgia. 17% to 29% of patients have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (2, 3). The fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2.3%. One retrospective study estimated the R0, the average number of new infections from an infected person to a na\u00efve population, to be 3.28 compared to WHO estimates of 1.4\u20132.5 (4). Values greater than 1.0 indicate the infection will likely spread rather than diminish. R0 values estimated from later studies tend to be more reliable due to s increased awareness and intervention.",
            "Chest CT findings at baseline. The varied findings on chest radiographs remain difficult to interpret because of nonstandard and vague terminology such as \u201cairspace disease,\u201d \u201cpneumonia,\u201d \u201cinfiltrates,\u201d",
            "s \u201cpatchy opacities,\u201d and \u201chazy opacities\u201d (3, 5). The more straightforward descriptions of CT findings can clarify findings on chest radiographs. The predominant CT findings of COVID-19 infection are bilateral, peripheral and basal predominant ground-glass opacity, consolidation, or both (6, 7). Opacities often have an extensive geographic distribution. Multiple discrete areas of ground-glass opacity, consolidation or both occur in a subset of patients\u2014often with round morphology or a reversed halo or atoll sign (see re the RSNA journals\u2019 compilation of the spectrum of published images: https://pubs.rsna.org/2019-",
            "nCoV#images). Pleural effusion, extensive tiny lung nodules, and lymphadenopathy occur in a very small number of cases and suggest bacterial superinfection or another diagnosis.",
            "Evolution of chest CT findings. Several studies have reported on short-term CT follow up of patients with COVID-19 infection. Pan et al described the temporal evolution of 21 patients with COVID-19 who recovered (7). Early-stage CT findings (0-4 days after symptom onset) from 24 CT scans were no lung",
            "P opacities (17%), focal ground-glass opacity or consolidation (42%), or multifocal lung opacity (42%).",
            "Approximately 50% of patients had peripheral predominant lung opacities. Serial CT scans during middle stages (5\u201313 days) of illness showed progression of lung opacities. Peak lung involvement was characterized by development of crazy-paving (19%), new or increasing lung consolidation and higher rates of bilateral and multilobar involvement (86%). Late-stage CT findings (14 days or longer) showed varying degrees of clearing but no resolution up to at least 26 days. Bernheim et al report similar findings in a retrospective review of serial CT scans of 121 subjects from four different medical centers",
            "Inin China (6). CT scans were normal in 20 of 36 subjects (56%) within 0\u20132 days after onset of symptoms yet only one of those 36 subjects had an initially negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19.",
            "Chest CT vs. RT-PCR viral nucleic acid testing. The real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 is believed to have high specificity but sensitivity has been reported to be as low as 60%\u201370% (8, 9). Thus, excluding a diagnosis of COVID-19 requires multiple negative tests, with test kits in short supply or unavailable in some regions of China. In response to reports of lung abnormalities on CT predating conversion to positive RT-PCR, Chinese authorities initially broadened the official definition of infection to include patients with typical findings at CT, even with a first negative RTPCR result. This broader definition has resulted in a higher number of presumptive cases of COVID-19 and an increasing role for CT in diagnosis. However, the presence of mild or no CT findings in many early cases of infection highlights the difficulties of early detection (6, 10).",
            "Summary.
