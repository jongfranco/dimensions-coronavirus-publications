            "But Croatia, Hungary, and Ireland advised against travel to the affected areas, and Italians travelling abroad are already feeling the effects of a crackdown. A bus from Milan was barricaded by police in the French city of Lyon for health checks and Alitalia passengers arriving in Mauritius were threatened with quarantine.",
            "Some countries outside Europe have already begun refusing travellers from Italy. Passengers on a flight arriving from Italy were blocked following disembarkation on 24 February at the airport in Mauritius.",
            "Meanwhile in the UK four people transferred from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan were confirmed as positive for covid-19. They have now been transferred to three specialist NHS infection centres. Two are in the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, one is in the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, and a fourth was transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.",

The 231 new cases bring South Korea\u2019s total to 833, and two more deaths raise its toll to seven.",
            "China also reported 409 new cases on Monday, raising the mainland\u2019s total to 77 150 after a zigzag pattern of increases in recent days.",
            "In Iran, the Health Ministry said that the total number of infections had risen to 61, while deaths stood at 12. But one politician in Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, was quoted by the semi-official ILNA news agency as saying that the death toll was 50.",

            "WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was premature to declare the outbreak a pandemic. \u201cThe key message that should give all countries hope, courage, and confidence is that this virus can be contained,\u201d he said.",
            "But Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said that extensive global spread now looked inevitable. \u201cI don\u2019t think too many people would argue that we are likely to see continued spread around the world and the eventual emergence of what will be the fifth commonly circulating human coronavirus infection.\u201d"
