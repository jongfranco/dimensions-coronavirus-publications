        "abstract": "Vaccines are biological preparations that improve immunity to particular diseases and form an important innovation of 19th century research. It contains a protein that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weak or killed forms of the microbe. Vaccines are agents that stimulate the body\u2019s immune system to recognize the antigen. Now, a new form of vaccine was introduced which will have the power to mask the risk side of conventional vaccines. This type of vaccine was produced from plants which are genetically modified. In the production of edible vaccines, the gene-encoding bacterial or viral disease-causing agent can be incorporated in plants without losing its immunogenic property. The main mechanism of action of edible vaccines is to activate the systemic and mucosal immunity responses against a foreign diseasecausing organism. Edible vaccines can be produced by incorporating transgene in to the selected plant cell. At present edible vaccine are developed for veterinary and human use. But the main challenge faced by edible vaccine is its acceptance by the population so that it is necessary to make aware the society about its use and benefits. When compared to other traditional vaccines, edible vaccines are cost effective, efficient and safe. It promises a better prevention option from diseases.",

Close monitoring is required while growing plants for the production of edible vaccines as there is chance of crosscontamination in molecular farming between genetically modified plants and non-genetically modified plants during pollination. There is a possibility of accidental entry of pharmaceutical in to the human food chain and may also affect the wildlife.

            "Vaccines are biological preparations that improve immunity to particular diseases and form an important innovation of 19th century research. It contains a protein that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weak or killed forms of the microbe. Vaccines are agents that stimulate the body\u2019s immune system to recognize the antigen. Now, a new form of vaccine was introduced which will have the power to mask the risk side of conventional vaccines. This type of vaccine was produced from plants which are genetically modified. In the production of edible vaccines, the gene-encoding bacterial or viral disease-causing agent can be incorporated in plants without losing its immunogenic property. The main mechanism of action of edible vaccines is to activate the systemic and mucosal immunity responses against a foreign diseasecausing organism. Edible vaccines can be produced by incorporating transgene in to the selected plant cell. At present edible vaccine are developed for veterinary and human use. But the main challenge faced by edible vaccine is its acceptance by the population so that it is necessary to make aware the society about its use and benefits. When compared to other traditional vaccines, edible vaccines are cost effective, efficient and safe. It promises a better prevention option from diseases.",

Our immune system destroys disease-causing germs that we call as pathogens and protects our body from their invasion.

            "Conventional vaccines have many limitations. One of the major problems is the safety concern. Failures in the inactivation can sometimes lead to reversion of the virulent form. Sometimes, quality control tests can fail and it can lead to contamination of vaccine with undetected virus or bacteria. Need for storage in refrigerated conditions is another limitation. Most of the vaccines are administered by parenteral route and it demands need for trained personnel, multiple doses or addition of an adjuvant, specialized storage and transport conditions. Injectable vaccines are able to stimulate systemic humoural responses only while T cell effector activity and mucosal immunity are essential for the prevention of infectious diseases. Parenteral vaccine administrations sometimes produce some secondary effects such as local inflammation at the inoculation point, fever and rarely some hypersensitivity issues. It is also not possible to develop vaccines against all diseases by conventional methods [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Due to many pitfalls, the thought of alternative vaccine delivery methods arises out and this paves to the development of plant-based vaccines called \u2018edible vaccines\u2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",
            "Edible vaccines are nothing but transgenic plant and animal-based production of or those contain agents that trigger an animal\u2019s immune response. In simple, plant or animal-made pharmaceuticals are edible vaccines. In 1989, the effort to produce a plant-based vaccine was formulated by Hiatt and co-workers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. In 1990, Dr. Arntzen introduced the concept of using transgenic plants to produce and deliver subunit vaccines. This idea of Arntzen proved that the edible vaccine can annihilate the restrictions in the production of traditional vaccines. In tobacco plant, (Streptococcus mutants) a surface antigen is expressed from hepatitis B by Mason et al is the milestone in edible vaccine production. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] In parallel to the production of edible vaccine in tobacco, they also started the production of hepatitis B and heat-labile toxin B in potato and potato plants [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. These vaccines have an indefensible advantage of over traditional conventional vaccines. Particularly in the developing world, edible vaccine offer exciting possibilities of reducing the burden of diseases such as hepatitis b and diarrhoea where storing and administering vaccine are often major problems. For production of edible vaccines or antibodies, it is desirable to select suitable plants, algae, yeast, insect cells and lactic acid bacteria whose products are consumed raw to avoid degradation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].",
            "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases approved edible vaccine for its remarkable effect of immunogenicity in 1998. This type of edible vaccines offers a cost-effective, needleless, convenient, safe, easy and a better alternative to vaccine production [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>].There were quite a lot of plant-based vaccines have been developed and most of them are at clinical trial phase [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Most of the plant-based vaccines were against viruses and bacteria that infect human, animals as well as poultry which cause fatal illness. So far, there is no edible vaccine that was approved by USFDA because, this type of vaccines were characterised under genetically modified crops. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] In the light of this sensational research, this review emphasizes on the uses, promises and challenges of edible vaccine in a future perspective.",
            "Edible vaccine mainly stimulates mucosal immunity. This configuration contains both the immune system\u2019s innate and adaptive arm (T and B cells). The composition is well structured and these so-called lymphoid mucosal-associated tissues (MALT). SIgA also plays a key role in protecting mucosal surfaces from adhesion for both microbes and toxin activity. The creation of new platforms for the delivery of pathogens or toxin-specific SIgA and systemic IgG is the key to improve vaccine efficacy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>].",
            "Microfold(M) cells are one of the major routes of the capture of the antigen at the intestinal level. M cells are a small amount of follicular-associated enterocytes (FAE) which are mainly found in the gastrointestinal tract. These cells capture a wide range of macromolecules from lumens in the small intestines to antigen submucosal cells (APCs) on Peyer\u2019s patches effectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Of many APCs, dendritic (DC) cells appear to be the most powerful antigenic cells to trigger an adaptive immune reaction in the priming naive T cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. In an immediate phase, DC is found in a stable state, marked by strong endocytic activity and low capacity for primary naive T cells. DCs, however, mature, increase co-stimulatory molecules and migrate to T-cell areas in lymph nodes under inflammatory situations. There are antigens as well as the release of cytokines to help differentiate the naive antigenspecific T cells into effector cells and migrate to a specific inflammatory site [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Intestinal DCs can promote na\u00efve t-cell activation and follicular T-helper differentiation (Tfh) either through direct promotion of Tfh differentiation or through promotion of later transformed T-17 cells into Tfh [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Such active B cells leave follicles and move to lymphoid MALT where plasma cells secrete antibodies against immunoglobulin A (IgA) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Those same IgA antibodies are diverted to the lumen in secretions across epithelial cells to interact with antibodies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. DCs can also capture luminous antigens specifically through the epithelial cell layer and then through dendrites projection into the lumen [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. The goblet cell, a type of cell involved in the development of mucins, was a recent mechanism for capturing antigen in the small intestine. Intravital microscopy shows that goblet cells can directly capture and supply intestinal antigens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. A reliable, edible vaccine will induce specific responses to T and B cells that will also facilitate long-lasting memory cells for subsequent gatherings during actual infection. Although the advancement of \u201coral tolerance\u201d refers to the T-cell-mediated paradox involving a decrease in the specific immune response to previously encountered antigen via the oral route, it was one of the controversies on oral vaccine administration [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>].Antigens are released in the intestinal immune system due to the lack of inflammation in which immature dendritic cells introduce T cells, which induces tolerance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. Secreted cytokines, such as IL-10, and cell-to-cell close contact occurs when regulatory T cells impede the growth and development of dendritic cells to modify their tolerogenic mechanism [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Recurrent administration of mucous antigen may also lead to suppression of the immune reaction in humour, and vaccines with reliable levels are difficult to produce [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>].",
            "Edible vaccines can be produced by incorporation of transgene in to the selected plant cell. The integration of the transgene can be done without combining with vector by direct gene delivery method or by combining with the vector by indirect gene delivery method. The transgene can be expressed in the plants by two transformation system depending on the site where antigen should be merged with the cells (stable transformation and transient transformation system) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]",
            "Direct gene delivery is the simple method. In this the selected DNA or RNA is directly introduced in to the plant cell. The most commonly used direct gene delivery method is the biolistic method and it is also known as gene gun or micro-projectile bombardment method. This is a vector-independent method. This is done when gene transfer through agrobacterium species-mediated transformation is not possible [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>].",
            "In this transformation method, the DNA or RNA is coated with gold or tungsten which acts as a micro-carrier. Then, the coated DNA is placed in to the gene gun and is exposed to high pressure of Helium gas. The coated DNA will move due to high pressure and gets penetrated in to the targeted plant cell. This method requires very high cost and can harm the plant. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]",
            "Nuclear transformation and chloroplast transformation can be done by biolistic method. These were the two types of antigen expression method [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. Incorporating desired gene in to the nucleus of the plant cell through non homologous recombination is called nuclear transformation and the gene is injected to the chloroplast to increase the protein expression is called chloroplast transformation. Most commonly adopted method for the production of edible vaccine is chloroplast transformation. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>]",
            "Examples of vaccines produced by biolistic methods are cholera, Lyme disease, anthrax, tetanus, plague, rota virus and canine parvovirus. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]",
            "This is a vector-mediated gene delivery. In this method, the desired plant cells were infected with plant bacteria or plant virus to produce the protein of interest [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]",
            "Agrobacterium is a gram \u2013ve bacteria that attacks the plants and transfer their genes to plant nucleus. Agrobacterium tumefacians and Agrobacterium rhizogenes were the two species that are commonly used. Agrobacterium tumefaciens carries tumour-inducing Ti plasmid and agrobacterium rhizogenes carries root-inducing plasmid Ri plasmid [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>]. The genes coded for auxin and cytokine in Ti plasmids were removed for vaccine production. This method is used to yield a stable integration of the antigen in to the plant genome. This is a slow process and the yield is low. But it is simple and cost effective. Examples for vaccines produced by this method were diarrhoea, TB, dengue, avian flu virus, ebola [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]",
            "This process modifies an appropriate plant virus to make a viral coat protein chimeric gene. It is therefore a vector for the delivery of genetic components in plant cells. In plants, this technique leads to transient antigen expression [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. The recombinant virus is a product of viral replication throughout viral infection in plants that expresses the intended protein or peptide. Furthermore, vaccine epitopes can be synthesized and accumulated by changing viral capsid proteins [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>]. Plant virus-induced infection has many benefits, including a large degree of recombinant protein expression shortly after disease, easy generation of multiple antigenic duplicates on layer of the viral particle and the permission of big-scale infections in the plant [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. However, viral reproduction products must first be purified from the infected plants before they are vaccinated. This technique of manufacturing also causes plant death following infection. Therefore, when the vaccine is caught, another plant needs to be infected with the virus and this reinfection method needs to be continuously made to produce sustained vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>].",
            "The previous advancement includes mainly RNA viruses, such as Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), Powder Virus (PVX), Alfalfa Mosaic Virus (AIMV), CMV and CMV as an expression vector. Plant Virus expression system mainly includes engineered viruses such as RNA Virus (CMV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. Such viruses do not reproduce in mammalian cells and are, therefore, an acceptable alternative vector for human and veterinary production. Additionally, as most expression mechanisms explain, the vaccine antigen obtained is protective against threat infection. DNA viruses such as Gemini viruses are also constructed as one of the most advanced plant expression systems with advances in plant virus molecular biology. Gemini viruses have a small single stranded DNA replicated by a double-stranded intermediate DNA in the nucleus of healthy cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>].",
            "Edible vaccines offer a better choice predominantly in developing countries because they are cost-effective, easily administrable, no storage issues and bio-friendly. Edible vaccines provide mucosal activity along with systemic immunity. Plant-based vaccines are comparatively more easier to manufacture, while normal vaccine production requires highly sophisticated and expensive techniques for bulk production as in mammalian and microbial cell culture . The statistics show that the entire population in China requires only 40 acres of land for production of hepatitis B edible vaccines annually. As per this, 200 acres of plot is required for the production of edible vaccine for all infants in the world [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Various edible products like plants, algae, insect cells, whole yeast and lactic acid bacteria are used as alternative agents for parenteral vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "In recent times, plants have also been widely used to design new biopharmaceutical systems, which facilitate the suitable folding of exogenous proteins and are economically viable [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>]. This is also known as \u201cmolecular farming,\u201d where marketing-value biomolecules of genetically engineered crops were generated. Numerous on-going clinical trials are underway using purified antigens temporarily generated in injectable vaccine formulations from tobacco plants (Nicotiana benthamiana). For e.g., a Phase II clinical trial has lately been performed using a quadrivalent flu vaccine (VLP) derived from plants and declared in recent times that a phase III clinical study has been undertaken [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>]. The idea that plants are edible led to their use for oral vaccinations in the beginning of the 90s. They could be a delivery vehicle, as well as bio factories, being edible. Research studies have attempted in recent times in the growth of edible products to resolve the weaknesses of traditional vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. When the idea was launched, several potential benefits have been apparent in using plants to produce vaccines. First, as the biopharmaceutical industry showed, plant vaccines would probably be lower production costs and it could be easy to scale. The victory of the experimental Ebola drug ZMapp manufactured in Nicotiana plants led to the gain of visibility in molecular farming [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>]. Unlike the production of biomolecule, however, the edible vaccine formulations require no pre-administration treatment or purification, which further lowers the cost involved with production.The most studies have utilized cultivated potatoes but, as cooking or boiling can weaken most of antigenic proteins, potatoes might not be the best choice in edible vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>]. More than a generalized application, but a successful design and development of genetic transformation methods, plants including tomatoes, maize, tobacco, bananas, carrots and peanuts will have a more bright future as edible vaccines. Till date, a large number of edible species, such as lettuce, tomato, potato, papaya, carrot, quinoa and tobacco has been converted into vaccine antigens.

The dangerous diseases such as polio and measles has badly hunted the life of old generation and became under control now only due to the development of vaccines. Vaccines are capable of reducing the antibiotic use tremendously and can play a crucial role in an era where antibiotic resistance is becoming a major challenge. Conventional vaccines are very expensive, requires refrigeration, mostly administered by parenteral route and it produces only modest mucosal response. Constant research activities can improve the presently available vaccination techniques and better prevention of infectious diseases can be ensured. Discovery of edible vaccine is one of the major break-through in the branch of biotechnology and its success requires wide acceptance and attention. Compared to the traditional vaccines, edible vaccines do not require sophisticated equipment and machines for the vaccine production. Edible vaccines are safer and do not demand sterile injection conditions and storage facilities etc. Edible vaccines stimulate both systemic and mucosal responses.",
