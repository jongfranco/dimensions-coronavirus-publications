Molecular operating environment (MOE, 2008.10) software package was used to explore molecular interactions between the drugs and HSA. Molecular docking was adopted to predict the interactions between resveratrol and other drugs and then the ultrafiltration technique was used to verify the docking results. In in vitro experiments, a mixture of resveratrol and celecoxib or leflunomide was added to rat plasma for determination of the plasma protein binding rate. Molecular docking results have shown that resveratrol interacts with HSA mainly through hydrogen bond and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, while celecoxib and leflunomide bind only with the hydrogen bond. Celecoxib or leflunomide, even at high tested doses, did not affect the plasma protein binding of resveratrol, thus suggesting pharmacological suitability of the investigated combinations.",

No significant endogenous peaks interfering with resveratrol were obtained in blank plasma (Figs. S1 and S2 in Supplementary material).<br/><br/>Calibration curves of resveratrol of rat plasma after ultrafiltration were linear over the range from 0.05 to 100 \u03bcg mL\u20131 (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 \u03bcg mL\u20131). The regression line equation for resveratrol was y = 37.68x \u2013 5.62; R = 0.9999, n = 3.<br/><br/>Recovery of resveratrol after ultrafiltration at 0.5, 5.0 and 50.0 \u03bcg mL\u20131 was 97.2 \u00b1 2.8, 96.3 \u00b1 1.2 and 96.7 \u00b1 3.9 %, resp.

            "In the present study, molecular docking was adopted to predict the drug-drug plasma protein binding interactions of resveratrol, and then the ultrafiltration technique was used to verify the docking results. Results demonstrate that resveratrol alone has a high binding rate with rat plasma proteins, even if combined with celecoxib or leflunomide. These results indicate that the proposed combination therapy might be pharmacologically feasible. However, the drawback of the study is the lack of more extensive investigation of different relevant pharmacokinetic parameters of resverastrol and its combination with celecoxib or leflunomide. Further studies will focus on drug-drug interactions of resveratrol with human plasma proteins. Thus, more in-depth studies are needed to improve the experimental technology and enrich research indicators."

            "Resveratrol (3,5,4\u2019-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic compound (1). Owing to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, resveratrol has the potential to treat inflammatory diseases (2). Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease, where resveratrol was shown to inhibit the overproduction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) (3). Besides, resveratrol inhibited the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and COX-2 (4). Resveratrol also"

Molecular operating environment (MOE, 2008.10) software package was used to explore molecular interactions between the drugs and HSA. Molecular docking was adopted to predict the interactions between resveratrol and other drugs and then the ultrafiltration technique was used to verify the docking results. In in vitro experiments, a mixture of resveratrol and celecoxib or leflunomide was added to rat plasma for determination of the plasma protein binding rate. Molecular docking results have shown that resveratrol interacts with HSA mainly through hydrogen bond and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, while celecoxib and leflunomide bind only with the hydrogen bond. Celecoxib or leflunomide, even at high tested doses, did not \u00adaffect the plasma protein binding of resveratrol, thus suggesting pharmacological suitability of the investigated combinations.",

            "Previous studies have shown that the very low oral bioavailability of resveratrol might be attributed to its structure and poor water solubility (6). Very low concentrations of free drug in plasma may also be due to its high binding to plasma or tissue proteins. The mean plasma protein binding (PPB) of resveratrol is 98.3 % in humans (7). Pharmacokinetic properties, such as the hepatic metabolism rate, renal excretion rate, membrane transport rate and distribution volume, are functions of the ratio of the unbound drug fraction (8). Therefore, investigation of pharmacokinetic parameters, such as plasma protein binding of resveratrol in combination with other drugs, is of great importance.",

A study has recently shown the synergistic effect of combining resveratrol with celecoxib on reduction of all tumor parameters in N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU)-induced breast cancer in rats (10).

            "Intra-day and inter-day RSDs were all lower than 6 % (Table SII in Supplementary material).",
            "Resveratrol was found stable in plasma at 37 and 4 oC (Table SIII in Supplementary material). Consequently, these results indicate that the analytical method was suitable for the present study.",
            "This is the first time that molecular docking is adopted to predict drug-drug plasma protein binding interactions of resveratrol. Molecular interactions between resveratrol and HSA include H-bond formation and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. Resveratrol binds HSA via hydrogen bond formation at Arg 117 and via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking at Tyr 161. Celecoxib binds HSA via hydrogen bond formation at Arg 485, and leflunomide forms an intermolecular hydrogen bond with HSA at Arg 10 (Table I, Fig. 2). Although resveratrol, celecoxib and leflunomide act on the same target, the site of interaction is different. This indicates that the three tested drugs act at different HSA sites. Therefore, resveratrol, celecoxib and leflunomide may have no competitive inhibitory interaction in clinical settings.",
            "Molecular docking of drugs with HSA is mainly based on clinical application, while determination of the plasma protein binding of resveratrol combined with celecoxib or leflunomide is a basic study. Therefore, the molecular operating environment (MOE, 2008.10) software package was used to explore molecular interactions between the drugs and HSA, predicting the interaction between resveratrol and celecoxib or leflunomide, and then the ultrafiltration technique was used to verify the docking results.

Results demonstrate that resveratrol alone has a high binding rate with rat plasma proteins, even if combined with celecoxib or leflunomide. These results indicate that the proposed combination therapy might be pharmacologically feasible. However, the drawback of the study is the lack of more extensive investigation of different relevant pharmacokinetic parameters of resverastrol and its combination with celecoxib or leflunomide. Further studies will focus on drug-drug interactions of resveratrol with human plasma proteins. Thus, more in-depth studies are needed to improve the experimental technology and enrich research indicators.",
