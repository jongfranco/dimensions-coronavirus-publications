Clinical symptoms developed in 6 patients, including headache, fever, sweats, myalgia, and joint pain, during December 8\u201311, 2018; the earliest symptoms began a few days after the men returned home from Illinois. One case-patient was hospitalized because of severe headache, fever, and myalgia. Three other case-patients consulted a physician but were not hospitalized, and 2 other case-patients had similar symptoms but did not consult any physician.<br/><br/>We compiled results of Toxoplasma spp. testing and deer meat consumption for each hunter (Table). Toxoplasma spp. IgM was detected in 6 serum samples collected during the acute disease phase for the 6 symptomatic hunters. For 1 symptomatic hunter, Toxoplasma spp. IgM was detected when a second blood specimen was collected 3 weeks later. No IgG was detected in these serum samples, which suggested a recent infection in these hunters. We detected IgG with a low avidity index in the 6 serum samples collected from 6 case-patients during the convalescent phase, which enabled confirmation of a recent infection for all of these case-patients. For the 4 asymptomatic hunters, we analyzed 3 serum samples and detected IgG with a high avidity index in 2 samples, which suggested that both hunters were already immune to toxoplasmosis; 1 asymptomatic hunter was considered to be nonimmune. Even if this hunter consumed fresh deer meat that was undercooked, he did not show development of any disease and did not have any positive test results.

        "Discussion": [
            "Outbreaks of acute toxoplasmosis infection are unusual in Quebec. In Illinois, no outbreaks were reported to the public health unit over a 20-year period. We identified a game meat\u2013associated outbreak in Quebec involving travel to Illinois. Investigative findings identified consumption of fresh, undercooked deer meat as the most likely source of infection.",
            "Sporadic cases associated with deer meat consumption have been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. During 2017, acute toxoplasmosis developed in 8 of 10 hunters after they consumed fresh deer meat in Wisconsin, USA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "During the outbreak we report, symptoms were severe enough that 1 case-patient had to be hospitalized and 3 other companions consulted a physician. Primary acquired Toxoplasma spp. infection is predominantly asymptomatic in immunocompetent persons in North America [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. During the outbreak we report, 6 of 7 nonimmune hunters for whom we had the information showed development of symptoms after infection. The severity of infection might depend on the genotype of the strain. The severity of infection is usually low in North America, where genotype II strains predominate [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], in comparison to other parts of the world [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].",
            "Another major outbreak of toxoplasmosis involving hundreds of persons was reported in 1995 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The suspected source was an infected cougar that had defecated in the watershed; heavy rains had then washed a bolus of oocysts into the water reservoir. The outbreak included a high proportion of severe primary infections among immunocompetent persons [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. In the locations of that outbreak and the outbreak we report (British Columbia and Quebec), the genotype was not determined. We are not able to explain why so many cases were reported among the immunocompetent population.",
            "In our investigation, we obtained serum samples from 3 of the 4 asymptomatic hunters. Toxoplasma IgG was detected in 2 serum samples. The absence of IgM and the high IgG avidity index suggest that both of those hunters were already immune to T. gondii by a past infection. One asymptomatic hunter did not show development of any disease and showed negative results for toxoplasmosis even after consuming fresh deer meat that was rare. We do not have immune information about the fourth patient.",
            "Food specimens collected from 1 hunter were negative for T. gondii. Unfortunately, parts of the deer that were consumed at the outfitter were unrecognizable from parts of other deer harvested in Illinois during the same period of time, which might explain the negative results.",
            "Little is known of the natural epidemiology of T. gondii infection in white-tailed deer. Given that deer are strict herbivores, it is believed that they become infected postnatally by ingesting oocysts from the environment [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. When ingested, the parasites form tissue cysts in the skeletal muscle and other tissues. When the infected deer die, tissues are scavenged by feline carnivore species, including bobcats and cougars [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. The life cycle then continues, and these cats shed more oocysts into the environment. Estimated Toxoplasma spp. prevalence among white-tailed deer varies across the United States from 15% to 74% (Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].",
            "The MAPAQ Website provides general recommendations to game meat hunters and their family about safe handling and preparation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Recommendations include not eating raw or undercooked game meat and cooking to an internal temperature of at least 160\u00b0F. They also recommend washing hands with soap and water after handling raw meat and cleaning all materials that come in contact with raw meat thoroughly after use. In addition, cysts and oocysts of toxoplasmosis might be destroyed by freezing the meat [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Because the prevalence seems to be high in wild animals in which study prevalence was determined, freezing the meat seems to be efficient to destroy cysts and oocysts. Hunters should be aware of those recommendations. A person can be infected for life and disease can reactivate years after the initial infection.",
            "Few studies have reported on the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma antibodies in humans in Canada. In the United States, a nationwide study conducted during 2009\u20132010 showed that the overall T. gondii antibody seroprevalence among persons >6 years of age was 13.2% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Others reports found that, although the presence of T. gondii is still relatively common, the prevalence in the United States decreased during 1988\u20131994 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Giving the high prevalence of Toxoplasma spp. in white-tailed deer across some areas of the United States and the overall observed decrease in seroprevalence in humans, outbreaks like the one we reported might be more common in the future, and health professionals should be aware of this possibility.",
            "In this investigation, we recommendations to all hunters and their families that they not consume the deer meat. This recommendation was given even if all hunters were immunocompetent. If hunters and their families decided to consume the deer meat despite our recommendations, they were advised to freeze it thoroughly, cook it, and avoid distribution of the meat to family members, pregnant women, or immunocompromised persons."
