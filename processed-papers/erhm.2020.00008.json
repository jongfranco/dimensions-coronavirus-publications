        "abstract": "In December 2019, a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia was first reported by the Health Commission of Hubei Province, China. Most of cases were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which was officially closed on January 1, 2020.1 As of January 3, the national authorities in China had reported a total of 44 patients with pneumonia to WHO. On January 8, virologists and other public health investigators identified a new coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, as the cause of the pneumonia clusters and posted the genetic sequence of COVID-19 on January 12.2 The clusters of new cases among families and the infection of 16 healthcare professionals indicate human-to-human transmission of the virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Chinese public health authorities have quarantined travel from Wuhan to limit the spread of the virus since January 23, and since then, more Chinese cities have also been isolated. As new cases and death toll from COVID-19 in China escalate rapidly and with COVID-19 spreading to other countries, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, noting the potential spread of the virus to countries with weak health systems. The Trump administration announced on January 31 that it would temporarily bar foreigners from entering the US if they had been to China within the past 14 days. Compared to prior SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2013, the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 presents an urgent and huge health threat since it is far more transmittable and far more damaging economically and socially. Therefore, governments and partners should take immediate actions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and bring the scientific community together to accelerate research and innovation against the global epidemic of COVID-19.",
