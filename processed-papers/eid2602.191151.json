On the basis of antigenic epitopes (A\u2013E) of major capsid protein that correlate with blockade of neutralization antibodies, the noroviruses from Thailand had specific amino acids in specific positions consistent with those for human norovirus GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney, which were not observed in human norovirus genogroups GI and GIV and canine norovirus genogroups GIV and GVII (Appendix Table 2).",
            "Pairwise comparisons of whole-genome sequences showed that the viruses had 99.90% nt identities (only 3 nt differences in ORF2; T1176C [silent mutation 392G], C1354T [silent mutation 452L] and",
            "in ORF3; T803A [V268E] to each other and highest nucleotide identities to human norovirus from China [99.00%; JN010] and the human norovirus reference Sydney strain [97.6%; NSW0514]). On the basis of partial ORF2 sequences, we showed that the canine noroviruses from this investigation were different from canine noroviruses GII.4 (3-09, 1C-09, and 261-10; 91.6% nt identities) and GIV, GVI, and GVII (52.90%\u201355.50% nt identities) (Appendix Table 3)."

        "Conclusions": [
            "We report infection of dogs with human norovirus GII.4 Sydney. Human noroviruses have been reported in dogs in Finland (GII.4 Denhaag and GII.4 unclassified) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Dogs showed mild clinical signs of acute watery diarrhea, similar to that for human norovirus infection, and low levels of illness and death. Similar observations have also been reported in other studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In this study, children had been hospitalized 2 weeks before the investigation. Disease developed in dogs and puppies after they shared the same premises and possible direct contact with the children. This observation suggests potential human-to-dog transmission of human noroviruses. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that whole genomes of canine and human noroviruses were closely related to human norovirus GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney, suggesting that a common strain is circulating in Thailand and worldwide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. However, in our study, it is not clear how and when the viruses were introduced to children and dogs.",
            "In summary, we demonstrated evidence of norovirus GII.Pe-GII.4 infection in humans and dogs in Thailand. Dog owners and veterinarians should pay more attention to norovirus infection as a potential zoonotic and reverse zoonotic disease in households, animal hospitals, and shelters. Expanded surveillance for norovirus is needed to determine its status and distribution in human and dog populations.",
