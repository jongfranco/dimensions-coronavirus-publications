        "abstract": "A strain of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), namely HLJBY, was isolated in Heilongjiang province, China. To provide insight into the understanding of the phy\u2010 logenetic and the current epidemiological status of PEDV, PEDV HLJBY was com\u2010 pared with CV777 and other PEDV strains deposited in the GenBank. The homology between the entire genomic nucleotide sequences of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 97.7%. The homology of M gene was the highest (99.0%). However, the homology of ORF3 gene was 97.7%, and protein of ORF3 was 90.1%. In addition, HLJBY showed the highest nucleotide identity (99.9%) with PEDV\u2010SX/China/2017 strain and lowest similarity (91.2%) to PEDV/Belgorod/dom/2008 strain. We analysed the changes in S gene and its protein of PEDV HLJBY with 65 historic PEDV strains. The highest nu\u2010 cleotide identity was 99.9% compared with PEDV\u2010SX/China/2017 strain, and the low\u2010 est nucleotide identity was 60.0% compared with PEDV/Belgorod/dom/2008 strain. The length of deduced amino acid sequences of S proteins varied from 1,372 to 1,390 amino acids (aa). Compared with most aa sequences of S proteins, HLJBY exhibited 5 aa deletions (position 55, 59\u201361, 144). Analysis and comparison of open reading frame 3 (ORF3) proteins between HLJBY strain and other PEDV strains were also focused in this study. We revealed that the length of deduced amino acid sequences of ORF3 proteins was 80\u2013224 aa among tested strains and the identity of HLJBY ORF3 amino acids with other PEDV strains was 71.4%\u201398.9%. ORF3 protein of both HLJBY strain and PEDV\u2010SX/China/2017 strain consists of 91 aa, with 133 aa deletions at their C' end in relation to the other tested PEDV strains. The phylogenetic tree based on different proteins or genes resulted in different phylogenetic groups. For pathogenicity evalua\u2010 tion of PEDV HLJBY strain, colostrum deprivation piglets were challenged with PEDV HLJBY, and PEDV reference strain CV777 as a control, the results showed that animals challenged with either of these PEDV strains developed diarrhoea, and histopathologi\u2010 cal examination of small intestines of challenged animals showed acute viral enteritis with villous atrophy in either PEDV HLJBY\u2010P10 or PEDV CV777\u2010P8 inoculated piglets.",

The biosecurity, vaccination and feedback are the fundamental methods for managing the dis\u2010 ease, but these methods do not effectively eradicate and block PEDV (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChae_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rChae_et+al_2000_a\">Chae et al, 2000</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2010_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2010_a\">Lee et al, 2010</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\">Li et al, 2012</a></a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLowe_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rLowe_et+al_2014_a\">Lowe et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOlanratmanee_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rOlanratmanee_et+al_2010_a\">Olanratmanee, Kunavongkrit, & Tummaruk, 2010</a>). In this study, we isolated one strain of PEDV from intestinal contents from PED\u2010affected pigs in China. The complete genome of PEDV named HLJBY was sequenced and then submitted to Genbank. To provide insight into the understanding of the genetic, phylogenetic and the current epidemiological status of PEDV, PEDV HLJBY was compared with CV777 and other PEDV strains. CV777\u2010based vac\u2010 cine did not block the new PEDV variants circulated in China since 2011 effectively (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\">Li et al, 2012</a></a></a>). Therefore, the relationship of PEDV HLJBY with CV777 was analysed firstly. The results showed that the homology between the entire genomic nucleotide se\u2010 quences of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 97.7%. Next, the homol\u2010 ogy of each component of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was explored. The range of homology of each component of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 99.0%\u201091.7%. The homology of M gene was the high\u2010 est (99.0%), which demonstrated M gene was the most conserva\u2010 tive. However, the homology of ORF3 gene between PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 97.7%, and protein of ORF3 was 90.1%, which revealed the identify of ORF3 gene between PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was the lowest. Therefore, ORF3 gene might determine the different properties of PEDV HLJBY and CV777. The ORF3 is the only auxiliary factor of PEDV. It was predicated that ORF3 had four transmembrane regions and formed homology (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2012_a\">Wang et al, 2012</a>). ORF3 may contribute to the virulence of PEDV. The ORF3 was a key gene for PEDV culture in vitro. ORF3 gene was usually used to differentiate between field and vaccine\u2010derived isolates and altered the virulence of PEDV (Park et al, 2008). In addition, the PEDV S protein is an important viral gene for studying genetic relatedness among isolates and epidemiology of PEDV (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rChen_et+al_2014_a\">Chen et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGerber_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rGerber_et+al_2014_a\">Gerber et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_2015_a\" href=\"#rLee_2015_a\">Lee, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2010_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2010_a\">Lee et al, 2010</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_2014_a\" href=\"#rLee_2014_a\">Lee & Lee, 2014</a>; Oh et al, 2014). Nucleotide sequencing of S gene analysis revealed that 3 nt deletions were found in S gene of PEDV HLJBY compared with CV777 (Figure 2c) and the nucleotide sequence identity is 97.0%. The amino acid sequence identity of S protein was 96.0% between PEDV HLJBY and CV777. 3 nt deletions of S gene were located in the amino terminus of S gene, which was suitable to analyse the significant differences in epidemiology of PEDV(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\">Li et al, 2012</a></a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTemeeyasen_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rTemeeyasen_et+al_2014_a\">Temeeyasen et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVlasova_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rVlasova_et+al_2014_a\">Vlasova et al, 2014</a>). S gene functions as a receptor\u2010binding domain(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBelouzard_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rBelouzard_et+al_2012_a\">Belouzard, Millet, Licitra, & Whittaker, 2012</a>). The 3 nt deletions might be leading to the change in structure and function of S protein. S gene might play a vital role in the genetic evolutionary process of PEDV. Therefore, it will be the focus of future research."

In this study, we isolated one strain of PEDV from intestinal contents from PED\u2010affected pigs in China. The complete genome of PEDV named HLJBY was sequenced and then submitted to Genbank. To provide insight into the understanding of the genetic, phylogenetic and the current epidemiological status of PEDV, PEDV HLJBY was compared with CV777 and other PEDV strains. CV777\u2010based vac\u2010 cine did not block the new PEDV variants circulated in China since 2011 effectively (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\">Li et al, 2012</a></a></a>). Therefore, the relationship of PEDV HLJBY with CV777 was analysed firstly. The results showed that the homology between the entire genomic nucleotide se\u2010 quences of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 97.7%. Next, the homol\u2010 ogy of each component of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was explored. The range of homology of each component of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 99.0%\u201091.7%. The homology of M gene was the high\u2010 est (99.0%), which demonstrated M gene was the most conserva\u2010 tive. However, the homology of ORF3 gene between PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 97.7%, and protein of ORF3 was 90.1%, which revealed the identify of ORF3 gene between PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was the lowest. Therefore, ORF3 gene might determine the different properties of PEDV HLJBY and CV777. The ORF3 is the only auxiliary factor of PEDV. It was predicated that ORF3 had four transmembrane regions and formed homology (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2012_a\">Wang et al, 2012</a>). ORF3 may contribute to the virulence of PEDV. The ORF3 was a key gene for PEDV culture in vitro. ORF3 gene was usually used to differentiate between field and vaccine\u2010derived isolates and altered the virulence of PEDV (Park et al, 2008). In addition, the PEDV S protein is an important viral gene for studying genetic relatedness among isolates and epidemiology of PEDV (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rChen_et+al_2014_a\">Chen et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGerber_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rGerber_et+al_2014_a\">Gerber et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_2015_a\" href=\"#rLee_2015_a\">Lee, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2010_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rLee_et+al_2010_a\">Lee et al, 2010</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_2014_a\" href=\"#rLee_2014_a\">Lee & Lee, 2014</a>; Oh et al, 2014).

The 3 nt deletions might be leading to the change in structure and function of S protein. S gene might play a vital role in the genetic evolutionary process of PEDV. Therefore, it will be the focus of future research.",
            "To further understand the status of PEDV HLJBY in the PEDV evolutionary and epidemiology, we analysed the relationship of PEDV HLJBY with 65 historic strains available in GenBank. Some researchers had analysed the sequences of PEDV strains, which gave a reference for us to understand the changes in evolutionary and epidemiology of PEDV. Our study will provide more information about diversity, evolution, and in particular, the epidemic charac\u2010 teristics of PEDV including HLJBY, which will give insight into the virulence of PEDV. First, the complete genome sequences of PEDV from different locations and years were compared, and the results revealed that HLJBY had the highest nucleotide identity (99.9%) with PEDV\u2010SX/China/2017 strain and lowest similarity (91.2%) to PEDV/Belgorod/dom/2008 strain. HLJBY shared 97.5% nucleotide identity with CH/S/2011 strain, which was isolated from the same province with HLJBY. Second,we emphasized the identity of S gene and protein of PEDV HLJBY in relation to other strains. The nucle\u2010 otide of HLJBY S gene was 4,149 nt, translating 1,382 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of HLJBY S gene was compared with 65 historic PEDV strains. The highest nucleotide identity was identified with PEDV\u2010SX/China/2017 strain, and the lowest nucleo\u2010 tide identity was 60.0% compared with PEDV/Belgorod/dom/2008 strain. The length of deduced amino acid sequences of S protein was 1372\u20131390 aa. HLJBY harboured the same length as PEDV\u2010SX/ China/2017 strain. Compared with S aa sequences of most PEDV strains, HLJBY showed 5 aa deletions (position 55, 59\u201361, 144) (Figures 3a and b), which might be leading to the virulence change in PEDV HLJBY. Third, we focused on the analysis of ORF3. We re\u2010 vealed that the length of deduced amino acid sequences of ORF3 protein was 80\u2013224 aa and HLJBY ORF3 amino acid identity was 71.4%\u201098.9% compared with that of other PEDV strains. HLJBY and PEDV\u2010SX/China/2017 ORF3 protein were 91 aa, which had 133 aa deletions at C' end in relation to most of other PEDV strains.",
            "In the phylogenetic tree of the whole genome, S aa and ORF3 aa, the phylogenetic tree based on both the whole genome and S aa was similar, but the phylogenetic tree of ORF3 aa was different from the phylogenetic trees for the S protein and genomic nucleotide se\u2010 quences. All PEDV strains were divided into three groups based on the phylogenetic tree of the whole genome and S protein. In the phy\u2010 logenetic tree of the whole genome and S protein, PEDV/Belgorod/ dom/2008 strain located at group I, and PEDV HLJBY belonged to the group II. In the phylogenetic tree of ORF3 protein, the group I only harboured PEDV/Belgorod/dom/2008 and HLJBY. The phyloge\u2010 netic tree based on different proteins implied the different evolution events. This will provide further information for virus evolution. The phylogenetic trees suggested that PEDV HLJBY might originate from a genetic recombination event between pandemic strains and classi\u2010 cal strains. We need to explore the mechanism and/or cause of the different phylogenetic trees based on different proteins or genes. This will lay a foundation for the recombination and evolution of PEDV.",
            "Biological characteristics of PEDV HLJBY including the cyto\u2010 pathic effect, and pathogenicity, indicated that PEDV HLJBY in\u2010 duced an apparent and classical cytopathic effect (CPE) in Vero cells, and caused acute viral enteritis with villous atrophy in small intestine of challenged piglets. But all HLJBY\u2010P10 or CV777\u2010P8 inoculated piglets had no deaths during the challenge experiment. These results suggested that PEDV HLJBY might have similar pathogenicity in ex\u2010 perimentally infected piglets compared with that of PEDV reference strain CV777.",
            "In summary, we found that the evolutionary trees are different based on different proteins or genes of PEDV strains. This phenom\u2010 enon needs further study. Pathogenicity evaluation of PEDV HLJBY indicated that PEDV HLJBY potentially possessed equal pathoge\u2010 nicity compared with that of PEDV reference strain CV777. This study might provide a reference for the evolutionary and variation of PEDV."
