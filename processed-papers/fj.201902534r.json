        "abstract": "HIV-1 Tat is essential for HIV-1 replication and appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurological complications. Secreted from infected or transfected cells, Tat has the extraordinary ability to cross the plasma membrane. In the brain, Tat can be taken up by CNS cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Following endocytosis and its internalization into endolysosomes, Tat must be released in order for it to activate the HIV-1 LTR promoter and facilitate HIV-1 viral replication in the nucleus. However, the underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes remain unclear. Because Tat disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis, we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. We demonstrated that chelating endolysosome calcium with high-affinity rhodamine-dextran or chelating cytosolic calcium with BAPTA-AM attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. Significantly, we demonstrated that pharmacologically blocking and knocking down the endolysosome-resident two-pore channels (TPCs) attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. This calcium-mediated effect appears to be selective for TPCs because knocking down TRPML1 calcium channels was without effect. Our findings suggest that calcium released from TPCs is involved in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. TPCs might represent a novel therapeutic target against HIV-1 infection and HIV-associated neurological complications.",

            "HIV-1 Tat is essential for HIV-1 replication and appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurological complications. Secreted from infected or transfected cells, Tat has the extraordinary ability to cross the plasma membrane. In the brain, Tat can be taken up by CNS cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Following endocytosis and its internalization into endolysosomes, Tat must be released in order for it to activate the HIV-1 LTR promoter and facilitate HIV-1 viral replication in the nucleus. However, the underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes remain unclear. Because Tat disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis, we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. We demonstrated that chelating endolysosome calcium with high-affinity rhodamine-dextran or chelating cytosolic calcium with BAPTA-AM attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. Significantly, we demonstrated that pharmacologically blocking and knocking down the endolysosome-resident two-pore channels (TPCs) attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. This calcium-mediated effect appears to be selective for TPCs because knocking down TRPML1 calcium channels was without effect. Our findings suggest that calcium released from TPCs is involved in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. TPCs might represent a novel therapeutic target against HIV-1 infection and HIV-associated neurological complications.",

A variety of endolysosome-resident calcium channels have been implicated in endolysosome calcium release including TRPML, TPC, TRPM2, P2X4, P-type, and L-type.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>] Using pharmacological approaches, we determined the extent to which blocking endolysosome calcium channels affected Tat-mediated LTR-transactivation. For these studies we blocked TPC with Ned-19, TRPML with ML-SI1, TRPM2 with flufenamic acid, P2X4 with 5-BDBD, P-type calcium channel with \u03c9-agatoxin TK, and L-type calcium channels with verapamil. Ned-19 significantly inhibited Tat-mediated LTR transactivation in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3E), but none of the other calcium channel blockers significantly affected Tat-induced LTR transactivation (Figure 3A-D). However, verapamil at the high concentration of 50 \u03bcM did significantly inhibit Tatmediated LTR transactivation (Figure 3F), but it is likely that this was due to its ability to block TPCs at such high concentrations.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>] Using the newer TPC blockers tetrandrine and fangchinoline[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>] at subtoxic concentrations of 0.5 and 1 \u03bcM66 we showed that tetrandrine (Figure 3G) and fangchinoline (Figure 3H) both significantly attenuated Tatmediated LTR transactivation. Thus, our pharmacological studies suggest strongly that blocking TPC attenuates Tatmediated LTR transactivation.",
            "We next determined the involvement of TPCs in Tat endolysosome escape using the split-GFP fluorescence Tat endolysosome escape assay. Blocking TPCs with Ned-19 significantly attenuated Tat endolysosome escape in the absence and presence of chloroquine (Figure 4A). To further investigate whether these effects resulted from altered Tat internalization, we then determined the extent to which blocking TPCs with Ned-19 affected Tat internalization. Ned-19 did not affect the internalization of Tat-FITC nor did it affect the remaining levels of Tat-FITC in the media (Figure 4B). These observations indicate that blocking TPCs prevents Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation.",
            "Given recent findings that blocking TPCs prevents the entry of virus into cells,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>] blocking TPCs may generally affect the escape of a variety of macromolecules from endolysosomes. Thus, we determined the extent to which blocking TPC affects the release of fluorescent-dextran (MW: 10 000) from endolysosome into the cytosol and the translocation of galectin-3 (26 kDa) to damaged endolysosomes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c68\" href=\"#r68\">68</a>] As a gene delivery enhancing agent, chloroquine's ability to promote endolysosome escape has long been recognized.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>] Chloroquine can rapidly diffuse into cells where it can be trapped in endolysosomes,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>] and upon protonation and subsequent influx of water molecules, chloroquine can induce osmotic swelling of the endolysosome and endolysosome leakage.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>] Thus, we used chloroquine as a positive control for endolysosome leakage and determine the extent to which blocking TPCs affects endolysosome leakage. Indeed, we demonstrated that chloroquine induced the endolysosome leakage of fluorescent-dextran and galectin-3 (Supplementary Figure S1). Significantly, we demonstrated that blocking TPCs with Ned-19 significantly attenuated chloroquine-induced endolysosome leakage of fluorescent-dextran (Figure 4C); Ned-19 attenuated",
            "chloroquine-induced increases in cytosolic green dextran fluorescence and decreases in endolysosome green dextran fluorescence. In addition, using the galectin-3 puncta assay we found that Ned-19 significantly reduced chloroquine-induced endolysosome leakage (Figure 4D); Ned-19 attenuated chloroquine-induced increases in the number of galectin-3 puncta. Our finding suggests that blocking TPCs exerts a general protective effect on endolysosome leakage.",
            "To further explore the involvement of TPCs in Tatmediated LTR transactivation, we knocked down the expression levels of TPC1 (Figure 5A) and TPC2 (Figure 5C) using shRNA strategies in U87MG cells, as confirmed by immunoblotting. Both TPC1 and TPC2 antibodies were validated in overexpression studies. The knockdown of TPC1 (Figure 5B) and TPC2 (Figure 5D) both significantly attenuated Tat-mediated LTR transactivation.

We also determined the effect of TPCs knockdown on Tat endolysosome escape in the presence of chloroquine and found that TPC1 knockdown, but not TPC2 knockdown attenuated Tat endolysosome escape in the presence of chloroquine (Supplementary Figure S3).

        "4  | DISCUSSION": [
            "It is well known that extracellular Tat enters cells via endocytosis, but little is known about how Tat escapes endolysosomes before entering the nucleus to activate the HIV-1 LTR promoter. Here we explored underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes using both split-GFP Tat endolysosome escape and Tat-mediated LTR transactivation assays. The main findings of these studies are that blocking endolysosomeresident TPCs attenuated endolysosome leakage, Tat endolysosome escape, and ultimately Tat-mediated LTR transactivation.",
            "The endocytic delivery of extracellular macromolecules and plasma membrane components for intracellular degradation requires traffic through early to late endosomes followed by fusions between late endosomes and lysosomes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>] Endolysosomes are complex and dynamic organelles that exhibit morphological and functional heterogeneity as well as the ability to physically and functionally interact with other organelles. An important hallmark of endolysosomes is their acidic luminal pH, which is maintained largely by the electrogenic pumping of protons by the v-ATPase in conjunction with vesicular chloride transporters that shunt the membrane potential and allow for a build-up of luminal protons.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c79\" href=\"#r79\">79</a>] The acidic pH of endolysosomes is critical for the activity of up to 60 different pH-sensitive hydrolytic enzymes including proteases, lipases, and nucleases thus enabling the endolysosomes to break down a wide range of endogenous and exogenous cargos.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>]",
            "In order to replicate, viruses need to enter host cells, and many viruses including HIV-1 enter host cells through the endocytic pathway.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>] Once endocytosed, viruses can be degraded by pH-sensitive hydrolytic enzymes in endolysosomes or alternatively they can escape the endolysosomes following which they can transit to the nucleus or recycled back into the extracellular space.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>] Similar to viruses, secreted viral proteins from infected cells can also enter cells via endocytosis. For instance, released HIV-1 viral proteins gp12085,86 and Tat[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] have been shown to enter cells via endocytosis, where they can exert direct cytotoxic effects. Tat protein is of particular importance for HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 disease progression, and the development of HIVassociated neurological complications because HIV-1 Tat is essential for viral transcription,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] ART does not block the secretion of Tat in HIV infected individuals,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and because brain levels of Tat remains elevated even though HIV-1 levels are undetectable.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] Secreted from HIV-1 infected cells,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Tat can bind to cell surface receptors including LRP1, heparin sulfate proteoglycan, CD26, and CXCR4, and enters CNS cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] Following its endocytosis and internalization into endolysosomes, Tat must undergo endolysosome escape and transit to the nucleus where it can activate the HIV-1 LTR promoter.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] Tat transits through late endosomes to the cytosol,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] but it is not clear how Tat escapes endolysosomes.",
            "Besides protons, endolysosomes contain high levels of calcium second only to the endoplasmic reticulum.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>] The release of calcium from endolysosomes has been implicated in numerous functions central to cellular well-being including lysosomal exocytosis,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>] endosome-lysosome fusion,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>] the activation of TFEB,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>] and the regulation of oxidative stress.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>] The release of calcium from endolysosomes is mediated by a variety of endolysosome-resident calcium channels.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>] Because others and we have shown consistently that Tat treatment leads to calcium dyshomeostasis in neuronal and non-neuronal cells,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>] we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation using split-GFP Tat endolysosome escape and Tat-mediated LTR transactivation assays. We found that chelating endolysosome calcium attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and Tat-mediated LTR transactivation, and that these affects were not the result of altered Tat internalization.",
            "Endolysosomes contain multiple calcium channels including a family of TPCs; TPC1, TPC2, and TPC3 (not present in mice, rats, and primates).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>] TPCs are located in endosomes and lysosomes where they trigger the release of Ca2+, Na+ or other cations from acidic organelles in response to various activators.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>] TPC1 is broadly localized to recycling endosomes, early and late endosomes, and lysosomes, while TPC2 is localized more with lysosomes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c96\" href=\"#r96\">96</a>] One fundamental difference between TPC1 and TPC2 is their voltage dependence[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c103\" href=\"#r103\">103</a>]; TPC1 is a voltage-gated channel able to be activated by the NAADP, Ca2+, and PI(3,5)P2, whereas TPC2 is voltage-insensitive.",
            "TPCs participate in the regulation of multiple endolysosome trafficking pathways[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c101\" href=\"#r101\">101</a>] and TPC1 helps control the uptake and processing of proteins in endolysosomes through the release for calcium.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c104\" href=\"#r104\">104</a>] TPCs are also involved in the pathogenicity of viruses like Ebola and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In particular, the inhibition of or the absence of TPCs blocks the entry of the Ebola virus into the host cell[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>] and impairs the progression of MERS-CoV through the endolysosome system.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>] Consistent with these findings, our findings provide evidence that TPCs are involved in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent Tat-mediated LTR activation. First, we demonstrated that a set of pharmacological blockers (Ned-19, verapamil, tetrandrine, and fangchinoline) of TPCs attenuated Tat-mediated LTR transactivation. Second, we demonstrated that blocking TPCs with Ned-19 attenuated general endolysosome leakage as well as specific Tat endolysosome escape. Third, the knockdown of TPC1 or TPC2 attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent Tat-mediated LTR transactivation. These effects were selective to TPCs because knocking down the endolysosome-resident TRPML1 did not affect Tat endolysosome escape or subsequent Tat-mediated LTR transactivation. Our findings suggest that blocking TPCs exert a general protective against the leakage of endolysosomes and especially the escape of larger molecules (MW \u2265 10 000) from endolysosomes because pharmacologically blocking TPCs attenuated the leakage of dextran (10 kDa) and increased the accumulation of galectin-3 (26 kDa), and because knocking down TPC1 enhanced Tat (14 kDa)-mediated LTR transactivation. However, knockdown TPC2 had a modest effect on endolysosome escape of the 29-amino acid GFP\u03b211-Tat peptide (MW ~ 3.5 kDa) used in the Tat endolysosome escape assay possibly due to enhanced internalization of Tat-FITC.",
            "The significance of these findings is threefold. First, because Tat is essential for HIV-1 replication and important for the activation of latent HIV reservoir, our findings that TPCs are involved in Tat endolysosome escape indicate that TPCs might be involved in latent HIV-1 infection especially in cells that require endocytosis for HIV-1 virus entry. Thus, blocking TPCs represent a novel therapeutic strategy against latent HIV-1 infection. Second, Tat is a neurotoxic protein, and the neurotoxic effect could result from Tat disturbing endolysosome function or Tat disturbing the function of other organelles such as mitochondria following Tat endolysosome escape. Thus, Ned-19, by inhibiting endolysosome leakage and preventing Tat endolysosome escape, may ameliorate Tat-induced neurotoxicity and may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against HIV-associated neurological comorbidities. It is important to note that the advantage of blocking TPCs as a therapeutic strategy is that TPC1 as well as TPC2 knockout mice do not have a reduced life span or an obvious reduction in quality of life.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>] Third, it is well known that Tat has the extraordinary ability to cross the plasma membrane and has been used to transport a variety of macromolecules into a plethora of cell types.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c105\" href=\"#r105\">105</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c108\" href=\"#r108\">108</a>] Our findings that TPCs are involved in Tat-endolysosome escape provide TPCs as a novel target for enhancing the transport of macromolecules into cells. Although we explored the involvement of TPCs in Tat endolysosome escape in the present study, the underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes remain unclear. Thus, further mechanistic studies are warranted.",
