Only sound health wisdom is the most important protection against the virus and the disease. We explore strategies for avoiding infections and fighting against the virus after infections. We mainly consider strategical differences on the basis of dynamical properties of virus invasion and reproduction, immune response, organ usable function, and scar formation. Part A is consistent with consensus, but Part B discusses new concepts that have not been recognized in medicine.",
