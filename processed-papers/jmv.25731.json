        "abstract": "To investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China, a total of 70 genomes of virus strains from China and elsewhere with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 were analyzed. To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we re-analyzed virome datasets from pangolins and representative SARS-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene. We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22\u201324 November 2019 and 1.19\u20131.31   10-3 substitutions per site per year, respectively. Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378). We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human",

            "In conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of further epidemiological investigations, genomic data surveillance, and experimental studies of the role of the unique furin cleavage motif (RRAR) of SARS-CoV-2 in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2 junction. Such work could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in real time, and to stem future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases."

            "To investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China, a total of 70 genomes of virus strains from China and elsewhere with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 were analyzed. To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we re-analyzed virome datasets from pangolins and representative SARS-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene. We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22\u201324 November 2019 and 1.19\u20131.31   10-3 substitutions per site per year, respectively.

We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human",

More than 1 300 cases have also been confirmed in at least 27 other countries on four continents. World Health Organization (WHO) officials outlined their top research priorities for controlling the outbreak of the coronavirus-associated disease known as COVID-19 and highlighted the importance of developing candidate therapeutics and easy-to-apply diagnostics for identifying active, asymptomatic, and resolved infections. Of note, the Coronaviridae family not only includes SARS-CoV-2, but also SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and common cold viruses (e.g., 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The",

            "Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds. Prior studies revealed that both SARSCoV and MERS-CoV to be zoonotic in origin, originally coming from bats[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], with SARS-CoV spreading from bats to palm civets to humans[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] and MERS-CoV spreading from bats to camels to humans[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Recent research has also reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely originated in bats, a proposal based on the similarity of its genetic sequence to that of other known coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. However, like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and many other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have been transmitted to humans by an intermediate animal host[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Therefore, the identity of the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 remains a key and urgent question. Furthermore, to stem future outbreaks of this type, preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans should be a top research priority.",
            "The existence of an intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 between a probable bat reservoir and humans is still under investigation. The discovery of a virus closely related to the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in a dataset from pangolins sampled more than a year ago illustrates that the sampling of other mammals handled or consumed by humans could uncover even more closely related viruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>].",
            "During a press conference on 7 February 2020, two researchers (Shen Yongyi and Xiao Lihua) from the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou identified the pangolin as a potential source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on genetic comparison of coronaviruses taken from pangolins and from humans infected during the recent outbreak. By analyzing more than 1 000 metagenomic samples and using molecular biology testing, they found that the positive rate of \u03b2 coronavirus in pangolins was 70% and that the genome sequence of an isolated virus strain was 99% similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thus, whether pangolins acted as a direct intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is worth further investigation.",
            "In the present study, we performed analyses of the transmission dynamics and evolutionary history of the virus based on 70 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains sampled from Australia (n = 4), Belgium (n = 1), China (Hubei Province, n = 19; Guangdong Province, n = 16; Zhejiang Province, n = 4; Taiwan, n = 1), Finland (n = 1), France (n = 4), Germany (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), Korea (n = 1), Singapore (n = 3), Thailand (n = 2), UK (n = 2), and USA (n = 10) with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020. We re-analyzed two of the 21 pangolin metagenome samples from previously published data[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] and compared the amino acid sequences of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related coronaviruses. These analyses should extend our understanding of the origins and dynamics, cross-species transmission, and subsequent host adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China and elsewhere."

For all NJ and ML phylogenies of the two datasets, bootstrap support values were calculated with 1 000 replicates[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] and trees were midpoint rooted. For \u201cdataset_70\u201d, regression analyses were used to determine the correlations among sampling dates and root-to-tip genetic divergences of the respective ML phylogenies with TempEst v1.535. We also estimated the evolutionary rate and time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for \u201cdataset_70\u201d using ML dating in the TreeTime package[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>].",

Multiple linkages were then combined into putative transmission clusters. Clusters comprised of only two linked nodes were identified as dyads. This approach detects transmission clusters in which the clustering strains are genetically similar, implying a direct or indirect epidemiological connection.

As more genome sequences become available, there may be stronger among-lineage rate variation over time as to warrant using a relaxed clock model, but we anticipate that the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates will be broadly similar to those estimated here. As the number of substitutions is still small, it is tempting to speculate that sequencing errors could have a considerable impact on the evolutionary rate and TMRCA date estimates. We removed three SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (i.e., BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-02/2019, EPI_ISL_403931; BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH-001/2020, EPI_ISL_406592; BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH004/2020, EPI_ISL_406595) with potential sequencing errors, but these may have less impact on the above estimates when more substitutions of SARS-CoV-2 are accumulated over time. We also expect that as more SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences become available, the estimated 95% BCIs of the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates will be narrower.",
            "We found that the Pangolin-CoV virus from the two pangolin samples was clustered with the SARS-CoV-2 virus with 100% bootstrap support; however, BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than to the pangolin coronavirus and the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (\u201cClade A\u201d) showed a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion not found in the other three clades (\u201cClade B\u201d,",
            "\u201cClade C\u201d, \u201cClade D\u201d). This insertion constitutes an RRAR motif in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2 junction in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, after considering the next amino acid (R) of the unique peptide (PRRA) (Supplementary Figure 6). Of note, the highly favored motifs for furin cleavage are Arg-X-(Arg/Lys)Arg (RXRR or RXKR), and the minimal motifs for furin cleavage can be RXXR52. We also note that some of the other coronaviruses have a furin motif in almost the same location in their spike proteins[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. Lentiviruses have an RKXR (R, arginine; K, lysine; X, any amino acid) site between gp[120] and gp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>], cleaved by furin to convert gp[160] into subunits[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that cleavage or lack of cleavage of the spike protein at this site could significantly impact host range and transmissibility. Taken together, the pangolin coronavirus samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378) were less similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than to the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus and did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the current outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins. However, due to the limited viral metagenomic data obtained from pangolins, we cannot exclude that other pangolins from China may contain coronaviruses that exhibit greater similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",
            "In conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of further epidemiological investigations, genomic data surveillance, and experimental studies of the role of the unique furin cleavage motif (RRAR) of SARS-CoV-2 in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2 junction. Such work could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in real time, and to stem future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases."
