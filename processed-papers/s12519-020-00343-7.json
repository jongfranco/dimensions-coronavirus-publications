        "abstract": "Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City, China, by January 30, 2020, a total of 9692 confirmed cases and 15,238 suspected cases have been reported around 31 provinces or cities in China. Among the confirmed cases, 1527 were severe cases, 171 had recovered and been discharged at home, and 213 died. And among these cases, a total of 28 children aged from 1 month to 17 years have been reported in China. For standardizing prevention and management of 2019-nCoV infections in children, we called up an experts\u2019 committee to formulate this experts\u2019 consensus statement. This statement is based on the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (the fourth edition) (National Health Committee) and other previous diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric virus infections. The present consensus statement summarizes current strategies on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019-nCoV infection in children.",

            "4. Samples from throat swabs (better using nasopharyngeal swab in children), sputum, lower respiratory tract secretions, stool and blood, etc. are tested positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acids.",
            "Based on the current epidemiological data, the incubation period of 2019-nCoV infections ranges from 1 to 14 days, mostly ranging from 3 to 7 days. Current reported data of pediatric cases revealed that the age of disease onset ranged from 1.5 months to 17 years, most of whom had a close contact with infected cases or were family cluster cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Infected children might appear asymptomatic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] or present with fever, dry cough, and fatigue, and few have upper respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion and running nose; some patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.",
            "Most infected children have mild clinical manifestations. They have no fever or symptoms of pneumonia with a good prognosis. Most of them recover within 1\u20132 weeks after disease onset. Few may progress to lower respiratory infections. No newborns delivered by 2019-nCoV infected mothers have been detected positive; and no newborn cases have been reported yet. It should be noted that clinical manifestations in pediatric patients should be further defined after collecting more pediatric case data. Furthermore, the number of confirmed infected cases will increase after a wide use of pathogen analysis.",
            "Data from adults reveal that severe cases often develop dyspnea one week after disease onset. Severe cases may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Although no deaths in children have been reported up to now, the potential risk of death should be highlighted. Though clinical symptoms in pediatric patients are relatively milder compared with those in adult patients, ARDS and death cases also occurred in infected children during the SARS and MERS epidemics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",

In the early stage of disease, chest images show multiple small plaques and interstitial changes, which are obvious in the lung periphery, further deteriorate to bilateral multiple ground-glass opacity and/or infiltrating shadows. Lung consolidation may occur in severe cases. Pleural effusion is rarely seen.",

Dyspnea: respiratory rate > 50 times/min for 2\u201312 months old; > 40 times/min for 1\u20135 years old; > 30 times/min in patients over 5 years old (after ruling out the effects of fever and crying); 2.

            "Differential diagnosis should be made to distinguish from influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, SARS coronavirus, and other known viral infections, as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. The coinfection of 2019-nCoV with other viruses and/or bacteria should be considered in diagnosis.",
            "1. Based on their medical conditions, suspected patients should be isolated in a single room or self-isolated at home following the doctors\u2019 advice.",
            "2. Confirmed cases can be admitted in the same ward.",
            "3. Critically cases should be admitted to ICU as soon as possible.",
            "The general treatment strategies include bed rest and supportive treatment; ensuring sufficient calory and water intake; maintaining water electrolyte balance and homeostasis; monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation; keeping respiratory tract unobstructed and inhaling oxygen when necessary; measuring blood routine, urine routine, C-reactive protein, and other blood biochemical indexes including liver and kidney function, myocardial enzyme spectrum, and coagulation function according to patients\u2019 conditions. Blood gas analysis and timely re-examination of chest imaging should be performed when necessary.",
            "The patients with high fever should be actively controlled. If patients\u2019 body temperature exceeds 38.5 \u00b0C with obvious discomfort, physical cooling (warm water bath, use of antipyretic patch, etc.) or antipyretic drug treatment should be performed. Common drugs include: ibuprofen orally, 5\u201310 mg/kg every time; acetaminophen orally, 10\u201315 mg/kg every time. Keep children quiet and administrate sedatives immediately when convulsions or seizure occur.",
            "When hypoxia appears, effective oxygen therapy should be given immediately including nasal catheter, mask oxygen. Nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, and non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation should be undertaken when necessary.",
            "Interferon-\u03b1 can reduce viral load in the early stage of infection which can help to alleviate symptoms and shorten the course of disease. Based on our clinical research and experiences of using interferon-\u03b1 in treating bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, acute upper respiratory tract infection, hand foot mouth disease, SARS, and other viral infections in children, the recommended usage is as follows: 1. Interferon-\u03b1 nebulization: interferon-\u03b1 200,000\u2013 400,000 IU/kg or 2\u20134 \u03bcg/kg in 2 mL sterile water, nebulization two times per day for 5\u20137 days; 2. Interferon-\u03b12b spray: applied for high-risk populations with a close contact with suspected 2019-nCoV infected patients or those in the early phase with only upper respiratory tract symptoms. Patients should use 1\u20132 sprays on each side of the nasal cavity, 8\u201310 sprays on the oropharynx, the dose of interferon-\u03b12b per injection is 8000 IU, once every 1\u20132 hours, 8\u201310 sprays/day for a course of 5\u20137 days.",

            "Avoiding irrational use of antibiotics, especially in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Paying close attention to the changes of conditions in children with coinfection of bacterial or fungal infection; actively collecting samples for pathogen analysis and timely or rational use of antibiotics or anti-fungal drugs.",
            "Arbidol is administrated for adults infected with 2019-nCoV; however, its efficacy and safety remain unclear. Oseltamivir and other anti-influenza agents can be applied for patients coinfected with other influenza virus.",
            "The use of glucocorticoids should be based on the severity of systemic inflammatory response, degree of dyspnea, with or without ARDS, and the progress status of chest imaging results.
