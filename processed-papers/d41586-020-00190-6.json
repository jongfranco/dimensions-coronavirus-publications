            "Structural biologist Rolf Hilgenfeld has been trying to develop a cure for coronaviruses since the 2002\u201303 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Hilgenfeld, who is based at the University of L\u00fcbeck in Germany, is hoping to get into the lockeddown city of Wuhan in China to test drug compounds in animals infected with the new coronavirus. He tells Nature about his quest.",
            "Why are you visiting China? After this virus emerged, I contacted collaborators in Wuhan. I have two compounds to test against the new virus, so I am seeking collaborators who have samples of the virus.",
            "At what stage of development are your compounds? We have been preparing them for testing in a mouse model of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In cell culture, we know they work against the SARS and MERS coronaviruses.",
            "Could they help to subdue the new virus? The problem with antiviral drugs is that when the compound is ready, there are no patients. After six months, we could have data showing that one of our compounds works against the new virus, and would be able to develop a drug. But if the outbreak is over, there will be no patients, so how can you do clinical trials?",
            "What do your compounds do? They are active against coronaviruses and a family of enteroviruses, which include hand, foot and mouth disease. Every year, half a million children get enterovirus-71, so we\u2019d aim to go into clinical trials for these diseases. We can involve pharma. If we have something approved for those, we can use the drug in the next coronavirus outbreak. The compounds are directed at viral proteases, which have common features in coronaviruses and enteroviruses.",
