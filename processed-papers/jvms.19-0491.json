            "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease in chickens, induced by IB virus (IBV) infection. The pathotype and S1 genotype of IBV field strain that was detected from to 2018 were investigated in Kagoshima prefecture, Japan. The frequency of cases that the renal lesion characteristic of IBV infection was histopathologically confirmed was significantly higher from 2014 to 2018 than from 2008 to 2009, suggesting the altered pathotype of IBV. Of genotypes (JP-I, JP-II, JP-III, JP-IV, Mass, Gray, and 4/91) that have been detected in Japan, genotypes except for JP-II were detected since 2008 and it appeared that the JP-III and JP-I have been predominant. The JP-IV with different antigenicity from other genotypes was detected since 2009.",
            "Key Words: genotype, infectious bronchitis, infectious bronchitis virus, pathogenicity, pathotype.",
            "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly infectious and contagious disease in chickens and induces numerous economic losses in the poultry farms. The IB virus (IBV), which is a causative agent of IB, primarily infects the respiratory tract and some variants or several field isolates affect the kidney and reproductive system, and subsequently induces various disorders to the host. The pathogenicity of IBV is very complex and constantly alters in the field strain, making it difficult to take control and protection measures for IB.",
            "IBV is a gammacoronavirus belonging to the family Coronaviridae and has a 27.6kb, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA genome. The IBV genome encodes the non-structural protein, accessory protein, and four structural proteins. Of the structural proteins, the spike (S)",
            "glycoprotein is processed into two subunits, S1 and S2, by post-translational cleavage. The S1 glycoprotein is serologically essential as the target of the neutralization antibody against IBV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Hence, it has been focused on the sequence of the S1 gene to analyze the molecular characterization of IBV. In Japan, Mase et al initially identified the five genotypes (JP-I, JP-II, JP-III, Mass and Gray) based on the S1 sequence of IBV isolated since 1950 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Subsequently, the existence of another genotype (4/91 and JP-IV) was reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].

Hence, it appeared that the pathotype of IBV field strain chronologically changed from respiratory to nephropathogenic in Japan.

Conversely, the change of pathogenicity from highly nephropathogenic to respiratory has been reported in the field strain in Australia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], and thus it appeared that IBV field strains have constantly altered the pathogenic features.",

In this study, there was no significant difference in the detection rate of the S1 genotype between the two groups, despite the change of pathotype in field strain, and the relationship between the pathogenicity of IBV and S1 gene remained unclear.

            "The detection rate of each genotype, shown in Table 3, might not necessarily reflect the prevalent status of IBV genotype in Kagoshima prefecture since 2008 because of the small sample size and bias regarding the region and farm of samples subjected to the present study.",
            "However, the JP-III and JP-I have been constantly detected for a long period at the wide area in the prefecture, as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, it appeared that the two genotypes have been predominant in Kagoshima prefecture since 2008. The JP-I is indigenous to Japan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], and it was speculated that the JP-I has originally evolved for a long time also in Kagoshima prefecture. On the other hand, the origin of JP-III is unclear. The phylogenetic analysis of present and previous studies suggests that the JP-III is closely related to the isolate in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. It has been believed that the IBV has a wide host range and infects not only poultry but also wild birds such as a duck [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Mase et al inferred the possibility of involvement of wild birds regarding the dissemination of IBV into Japan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. In Kagoshima prefecture, there is a large plain (called \u201cIzumi plain\u201d) as an overwintering site for wild migrant birds including a duck that infects with a virus such as avian influenza virus and that migrates among neighboring countries including China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. The predominance of JP-III in Kagoshima prefecture might not be irrelevant to the existence of a \u201cportal site\u201d, such as Izumi plain, for viruses derived from neighboring countries.",
            "It is essential for the prevention and control of IB to estimate the S1 genotype of IBV field strain because the S1 genotype of field strain is associated with the vaccine selection in a chicken farm. All of the S1 genotypes, except for JP-II, were detected in Kagoshima prefecture since 2008. It implied the diversity of IBV field strain in Kagoshima prefecture. A flexible vaccination strategy would be needed for the prevention and control of IB.",

            "1) and the earliest detection case was in January 2009 in a broiler farm (Case 2 in Table 1). On the other hand, the JP-IV was initially reported as a novel genotype of IBV in Japan, which was identified from the samples collected in September 2009 in a layer farm located at Ibaraki prefecture [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], more than 1,000 km far away from Kagoshima prefecture. Although the JP-IV was found in the farms located at Ibaraki and Kagoshima prefecture almost during the corresponding period, there was no geographic and epidemiological relationship between the two farms. Hence, it appeared that JP-IV has widely disseminated into Japan since at least 2009.",
            "In addition, the virulence of JP-IV was believed to be low in the previous study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. However, the both of respiratory and renal lesions were histopathologically confirmed in 2 of 3 cases (Case 8 and 11, Table 1) that the JP-IV was detected, and the JP-IV alone was detected in Case (Table 1). The 2 cases suggest the altered pathogenicity of JP-IV strain in Japan although the virulence to affected chickens in the cases might not necessarily be due to the IBV alone because of the complications such as Coccidiosis and Colibacillosis. Moreover, the antigenicity of JP-IV differs from others detected in Japan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Therefore, the JP-IV strain could be a great threat to all of the chicken farms in Japan.
