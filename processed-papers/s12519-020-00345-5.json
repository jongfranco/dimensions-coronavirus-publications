For example, according to researches on SARS-CoV and MERS-COV, the virus can be inactivated by heating at 56 \u00b0C for 30 minutes and by using lipid solvents such as 75% ethanol, chlorinecontaining disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid and chloroform, but not by chlorhexidine, according to the researches on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV."

Dyspnea, cyanosis and other symptoms can occur as the condition progresses usually after 1 week of the disease, accompanied by systemic toxic symptoms, such as malaise or restlessness, poor feeding, bad appetite and less activity. The condition of some children may progress rapidly and may develop into respiratory failure that cannot be corrected by conventional oxygen (nasal catheter, mask) within 1\u20133 days.

With the aggravation of the disease, respiratory distress, nasal flaring, suprasternal, intercostal and subcostal retractions, grunting and cyanosis may occur.",
