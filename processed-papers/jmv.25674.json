        "abstract": "Respiratory tract viral infection caused by viruses or bacteria is one of the most common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, 2019\u2010nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China most recently, have posed great threats to global public health. Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray\u2010based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.",

This assay uses multiple oligonucleotides specially designed to target conserved sequences encoding HA, NA and M proteins of influenza A and B viruses.5 For instance, Zhao's research group has developed a gold nanoparticle\u2010based genomic microarray assay, which is able to differentiate H5N1 viruses from the major seasonal influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2). This can be explained by oligonucleotides which are designed on the basis of consensus sequence of the HA and NA genes of the H5N1 virus and M gene of H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses.13 The same group has expanded the platform and designed specific oligonucleotides for HA, NA and M genes of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, enabling the detection of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and distinguish it from other influenza A viruses.46},\n  language = {}\n}\n@article{mahony2011a,\n  author = {Mahony, J.B. and Petrich, A. and Smieja, M.},\n  title = {Molecular diagnosis of respiratory virus infections},\n  journal = {Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci},\n  date = {2011},\n  volume = {48},\n  pages = {217\u2013249},\n  language = {}\n}\n@article{azar2018a,\n  author = {Azar, M.M. and Landry, M.L.},\n  title = {Detection of influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus by use of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)\u2010waived point\u2010of\u2010care assays: a paradigm shift to molecular tests},\n  journal = {J Clin Microbiol},\n  date = {2018},\n  volume = {56},\n  pages = {00367\u201318},\n  language = {}\n}\n@article{fendrick2003a,\n  author = {Fendrick, A.M. and Monto, A.S. and Nightengale, B. and Sarnes, M.},\n  title = {The economic burden of non\u2010influenza\u2010related viral respiratory tract infection in the United States},\n  journal = {Arch Intern Med},\n  date = {2003},\n  volume = {163},\n  pages = {487\u2013494},\n  language = {}\n}\n@article{hu2015a,\n  author = {Hu, B. and Ge, X. and Wang, L.F. and Shi, Z.},\n  title = {Bat origin of human coronaviruses},\n  journal = {Virol J},\n  date = {2015},\n  volume = {12},\n  pages = {221},\n  language = {}\n}\n@misc{vemula2016a,\n  author = {Vemula, S.V. and Zhao, J. and Liu, J. and Wang, X. and Biswas, S. and Hewlett, I.},\n  title = {Current approaches for diagnosis of influenza virus infections in humans.

This assay uses multiple oligonucleotides specially designed to target conserved sequences encoding HA, NA and M proteins of influenza A and B viruses.5 For instance, Zhao's research group has developed a gold nanoparticle\u2010based genomic microarray assay, which is able to differentiate H5N1 viruses from the major seasonal influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2). This can be explained by oligonucleotides which are designed on the basis of consensus sequence of the HA and NA genes of the H5N1 virus and M gene of H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses.13 The same group has expanded the platform and designed specific oligonucleotides for HA, NA and M genes of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, enabling the detection of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and distinguish it from other influenza A viruses.46\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - JOUR\nAU  - Mahony, J.B.\nAU  - Petrich, A.\nAU  - Smieja, M.\nTI  - Molecular diagnosis of respiratory virus infections\nT2  - Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci\nPY  - 2011\nDA  - 2011\nVL  - 48\nSP  - 217\nEP  - 249\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - JOUR\nAU  - Azar, M.M.\nAU  - Landry, M.L.\nTI  - Detection of influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus by use of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)\u2010waived point\u2010of\u2010care assays: a paradigm shift to molecular tests\nT2  - J Clin Microbiol\nPY  - 2018\nDA  - 2018\nVL  - 56\nSP  - 00367\nEP  - 18\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - JOUR\nAU  - Fendrick, A.M.\nAU  - Monto, A.S.\nAU  - Nightengale, B.\nAU  - Sarnes, M.\nTI  - The economic burden of non\u2010influenza\u2010related viral respiratory tract infection in the United States\nT2  - Arch Intern Med\nPY  - 2003\nDA  - 2003\nVL  - 163\nSP  - 487\nEP  - 494\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - JOUR\nAU  - Hu, B.\nAU  - Ge, X.\nAU  - Wang, L.F.\nAU  - Shi, Z.\nTI  - Bat origin of human coronaviruses\nT2  - Virol J\nPY  - 2015\nDA  - 2015\nVL  - 12\nSP  - 221\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - GEN\nAU  - Vemula, S.V.\nAU  - Zhao, J.\nAU  - Liu, J.\nAU  - Wang, X.\nAU  - Biswas, S.\nAU  - Hewlett, I.\nTI  - Current approaches for diagnosis of influenza virus infections in humans.

            "Respiratory viruses are a major cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infection in all age groups worldwide. Timely and accurate diagnosis of these viruses enables appropriate treatment of infections. Traditional and modern molecular diagnostic approaches with their advantages, disadvantages and principles, are summarized for several common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human RSV, coronavirus, hAdV, and rhinovirus, as discussed in this review. However, these respiratory viruses are prone to antigenic drift caused by point mutations in viral genes, and new strains with pandemic potential may result from gene reassortment. All of these continue to pose new challenges to rapid and accurate detection of respiratory virus infection in humans. Therefore, the identification of mutations within viral genomes is quite essential. However, efforts to pinpoint genetic mutations in human respiratory viruses have relied on high\u2010throughput sequencing of single genes or gene families using Sanger sequencing. Although this approach has been fruitful, the cost and throughput of Sanger sequencing generally prohibits systematic sequencing of the ~22 000 genes that make up the exome. The recent development of NGS technologies changed this paradigm by providing the capability to rapidly sequence exomes, transcriptomes, and genomes at relatively low cost. The application of NGS in diagnosis and identification of respiratory pathogens especially for patients with severe pneumonia or those with unknown origin infections becomes more and more popular. NGS exhibited the ability to detect coinfections in severe pneumonia patients and performed well in diagnosing severe pneumonia compared to conventional methods. As an infrequently circulating genotype, genomic characterization of the whole genome of a viral strain will promote further studies on its epidemiology and pathogenicity, and aid the diagnosis of a new emerging respiratory virus. WGS enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub\u2010genomic sequences."

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses can help in epidemiologic monitoring, along with taking effective prevention steps and implementing appropriate antiviral therapies. Over the past decades, an evolution in viral diagnostic testing has been seen, all the way from conventional approaches to rapid antigen detection.

This approach includes inoculation of the corresponding cell lines, such as Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK), A549, and rhesus monkey kidney (LLC MK2), with clinical samples, propagation for seven to 10 days to monitor the development of cytopathic effect (CPE), and final confirmation of influenza virus infection by hemadsorption using erythrocytes, specific antibody staining or immunofluorescence microscopy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] IFA has been used since the 1960s. It directly stains respiratory epithelial cells derived from nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs with fluorescently labeled influenza virus\u2010specific antibodies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] Currently, several FDA\u2010 approved enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent (ELISA)\u2010based tests are available for diagnosis of influenza virus infections. However, ELISA\u2010based tests often show lower sensitivity compared with nucleic acid\u2010based methods.

With the development of laboratory approaches for virus diagnosis, isolation of viral pathogens from secretion samples has become much easier than before.",
            "The rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) offers a faster approach for detecting both influenza A and B viruses. However, it has limited ability to further identify the subtypes of influenza viruses. In addition, its test performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity) varies widely. For example, in November 2009, 290 suspected influenza patients were analyzed using direct antigen EZ Flu A+B kit. The sensitivity and specificity of RIDT were 40.5% and 94.5%, respectively.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>] NAAT assays based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detect virus\u2010specific genetic materials, rather than viral antigens or antibodies. Therefore, optimal extraction of viral genetic materials is required. One of the advantages of NAAT over RIDT is that NAAT is able to identify different subtypes of influenza viruses. Trombetta's group found that NAAT shows much higher sensitivity for both influenza A and influenza B viruses, despite its relative lower specificity.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] A variety of NAAT assays, such as reverse transcriptase\u2010PCR, loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification\u2010based assay (LAMP), DNA\u2010microarray\u2010based and sequencing\u2010based tests, are appearing for diagnosis of influenza viral infections in humans.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] Using the LAMP approach, Poon's group demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detection of seasonal influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses from clinical specimens with analytical sensitivity of 10 copies per reaction.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Compared with the RT\u2010PCR\u2010based assay, a real\u2010time reverse transcription LAMP\u2010based assay (RT\u2010LAMP) showed a sensitivity of 97.8% and a specificity of 100% for detecting 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] LAMP\u2010 based assays have also been used to detect the highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses, having comparable, or higher, sensitivities than RT\u2010PCR\u2010based approaches.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] However, the high cost of NAAT, the complexity of the equipment required, and the need for trained professionals make NAAT assays less practical in areas with limited resources.",

This assay uses multiple oligonucleotides specially designed to target conserved sequences encoding HA, NA and M proteins of influenza A and B viruses.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] For instance, Zhao's research group has developed a gold nanoparticle\u2010based genomic microarray assay, which is able to differentiate H5N1 viruses from the major seasonal influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2). This can be explained by oligonucleotides which are designed on the basis of consensus sequence of the HA and NA genes of the H5N1 virus and M gene of H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] The same group has expanded the platform and designed specific oligonucleotides for HA, NA and M genes of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, enabling the detection of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and distinguish it from other influenza A viruses.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>]",

        "8 | CONCLUSIONS": [
            "Respiratory viruses are a major cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infection in all age groups worldwide. Timely and accurate diagnosis of these viruses enables appropriate treatment of infections. Traditional and modern molecular diagnostic approaches with their advantages, disadvantages and principles, are summarized for several common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human RSV, coronavirus, hAdV, and rhinovirus, as discussed in this review. However, these respiratory viruses are prone to antigenic drift caused by point mutations in viral genes, and new strains with pandemic potential may result from gene reassortment. All of these continue to pose new challenges to rapid and accurate detection of respiratory virus infection in humans. Therefore, the identification of mutations within viral genomes is quite essential. However, efforts to pinpoint genetic mutations in human respiratory viruses have relied on high\u2010throughput sequencing of single genes or gene families using Sanger sequencing. Although this approach has been fruitful, the cost and throughput of Sanger sequencing generally prohibits systematic sequencing of the ~22 000 genes that make up the exome. The recent development of NGS technologies changed this paradigm by providing the capability to rapidly sequence exomes, transcriptomes, and genomes at relatively low cost. The application of NGS in diagnosis and identification of respiratory pathogens especially for patients with severe pneumonia or those with unknown origin infections becomes more and more popular. NGS exhibited the ability to detect coinfections in severe pneumonia patients and performed well in diagnosing severe pneumonia compared to conventional methods. As an infrequently circulating genotype, genomic characterization of the whole genome of a viral strain will promote further studies on its epidemiology and pathogenicity, and aid the diagnosis of a new emerging respiratory virus. WGS enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub\u2010genomic sequences."

            "Acute respiratory disease (ARD) accounts for a large proportion of all acute morbidities, as well as mortalities, worldwide, among which acute viral respiratory tract infection is the leading cause.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].",
            "A novel coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV has caused the pneumonia in 41 confirmed cases of patients, including 7 in serious condition, 1 dead, and 2 recovered.",
            "The full genomic sequence of this coronavirus was released on January 10, 2020, which is more than 82% identical to those of SARS\u2010CoV and bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (SL\u2010CoV).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]"

        "Results": [
            "The full genomic sequence of this coronavirus was released on January 10, 2020, which is more than 82% identical to those of SARS\u2010CoV and bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (SL\u2010CoV).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "The sensitivity and specificity of the abovementioned kits are normally higher than 90% and 95%, but they differ by manufacturer.",
            "Based on the validation tests, including 28 specificity panels and 9 clinical specimens, the sensitivity and specificity of all these rRT\u2010PCR kits for detecting upE and ORF1a reach 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60\u20101.00) and 100% (95% CI, 0.79\u20101.00), respectively.",
            "A total of 284 clinical respiratory specimens, including hAdV and RV, and 3 influenza A/H7N9 viral culture samples have been tested, and the overall diagnostic sensitivity of the NxTAG\u2010RPP was 98.9% (95% CI, 97.2 to 99.7), while the specificity was 99.0% (95% CI, 98.6 to 99.2)"

        "Conclusion": [
            "Respiratory viruses are a major cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infection in all age groups worldwide.",
            "Traditional and modern molecular diagnostic approaches with their advantages, disadvantages and principles, are summarized for several common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human RSV, coronavirus, hAdV, and rhinovirus, as discussed in this review",
            "These respiratory viruses are prone to antigenic drift caused by point mutations in viral genes, and new strains with pandemic potential may result from gene reassortment.",

This assay uses multiple oligonucleotides specially designed to target conserved sequences encoding HA, NA and M proteins of influenza A and B viruses.5 For instance, Zhao's research group has developed a gold nanoparticle\u2010based genomic microarray assay, which is able to differentiate H5N1 viruses from the major seasonal influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2). This can be explained by oligonucleotides which are designed on the basis of consensus sequence of the HA and NA genes of the H5N1 virus and M gene of H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses.13 The same group has expanded the platform and designed specific oligonucleotides for HA, NA and M genes of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, enabling the detection of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and distinguish it from other influenza A viruses.46",
