On admission, he had slight cough of a little green viscous sputum. He had been treated with normal anti-infective therapy in another hospital for 3 days, but did not respond it. After then, he visited our department. The radiography of the chest at the OPD suggested the right lung infection."

We also used drugs to treat atypical pathogens, including moxifloxacin for mycoplasma and chlamydia, and oseltamivir and abidol hydrochloride for influenza A virus; meanwhile, the patient was given Chinese patent medicine Tanreqing iv gtt for adjunctive therapy. On Jan 10, 2020, the female patient was re-examined for all inflammatory indexes and all showed normal, and he was discharged from hospital on the same day.",

The above mentioned indicators meet the clinical diagnostic standards for unexplained pneumonia issued in China (National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2007). But the clinical manifestations in this couple were not exactly the same. On admission, beside fever, the male was predominately manifested by dyspnea and only had mild abnormality in routine urine and stool test results, while the female had obvious gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. These suggest this virus may be present in urine and stools, but we did not run pathogen isolation and detection, and it is only presumption. As for why the male had only abnormality in urine and stools rather than gastrointestinal symptoms, while the female had no abnormality in urine or stools but had gastrointestinal symptoms on the contrary, we have no definite explanation. Before the onset, the couple went to a restaurant one stop away from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market to eat frozen seafood. Maybe they get sick after being exposed to the same pathogen. The male developed symptoms first and had more severe clinical symptoms, which may be related to his immunity was better than the female. After the first exposure to the virus, patients with better immunity have stronger body reactions.",
            "Innate immune cells play a vital role in effective host responses to various pathogens. Neutrophils and monocytes-macrophages are the major innate immune cells that coordinate innate immunity against viral lung infections. Respiratory viruses can inhibit the innate immune response, and consequently obtain effective opportunities for virus replication and infection. The affected innate immune response also affects subsequent adaptive immune responses; so, viral innate immune evasion often disrupts the complete protective immunity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKikkert_2020_a\" href=\"#rKikkert_2020_a\">Kikkert 2020</a>).

On January 5, 2020, the female\u2019 conditions were improved, but the CD3, CD4, and CD8 cells declined further. Perhaps the female patient recalled more immune cells to participate in the antiviral process in her body. Our observations show that the number of CD3, CD4, and CD8 cells cannot predict disease progression. In this study, the male had a more severe decrease in immune cells and more severe conditions than the female. In addition, after comparing our other similar cases, we found that the lower the number of primary immune cells, the more severe the conditions, which is consistent with previous observations (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2004_a\">Huang et al 2004</a>).",

            "From a previous study on the dynamic changes of peripheral blood immune cells in some 2003 SARS cases reported by Dr. Jianping Zhang et al from Beijing Ditan Hospital, it was shown that during the onset of SARS patients, B cells showed a continuous increase, while NK cells showed a slow and continuous decline, which was statistically significant (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhang_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rZhang_et+al_2003_a\">Zhang et al 2003</a>). However, our female patient is not consistent with this observation. May it suggest that the 2019-nCoV induce slight different immune response from the SARS-CoV? To answer this, it requires more samples and further comprehensive studies.",
            "When the symptoms in the male were improved on January 3, 2020, the chest imaging manifestations progressed a little compared with before on the contrary. This condition was previously reported in severe Legionella pneumonia. The condition change was manifested mainly by clinical symptoms, while the imaging manifestations may be related to the increased exudation and strengthened responsiveness. But it is interesting that the patient\u2019s condition was improved but CRP and SAA were also increased, which has not attracted attentions in the past. It was the same in the female. On January 5, 2020, the patient\u2019s condition was improved, and the image showed the lesions were slightly absorbed when compared with before, while CRP and SAA were also increased significantly. This aspect is worthy of further observation and research.",

As for experience of medication, we used large doses of gamma globulin, and hormone at the beginning of the disease. But the duration of hormone was different for different patients. After using 40 mg once, the drug was no longer used for the male, while the female used it for a longer time, mainly according to the clinical symptoms and changes of chest imaging findings. Other treatments were antibacterial drugs, drugs for atypical pathogens such as mycoplasma and chlamydia, oseltamivir and abidol hydrochloride for viruses, and Chinese herbal medicine Tanreqing.",
