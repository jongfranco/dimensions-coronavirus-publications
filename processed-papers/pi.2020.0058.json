            "An outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-nCoV) infection between May and December 2015 in Korea resulted in 186 cases of infection, 38 deaths, and 16,692 exposed individuals who were quarantined. Despite the elapsed time since this outbreak, a high risk of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were reported by healthcare workers who treated the MERS-nCoV infected patients and by hemodialysis patients in quarantine.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] Additionally, the negative emotion and stress experienced by the healthcare workers who treated the MERS-nCoV infected patients were characterized by trigger events categorized into mistake, missing, delay due to communication failure, and others. Therefore, the identification of the trigger events was suggested as an important hospital management guideline during an infectious disease outbreak.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] Moreover, among the exposed individuals in quarantine not diagnosed with the MERS-nCoV infection, 7.6% and 16.6% presented anxiety and feelings of anger symptoms, respectively, during the quarantine period. Even four to six months after the end of the quarantine period, 3.0% and 6.4% patients persistently presented with symptoms of anxiety and anger, respectively.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Thus, after the MERSnCoV infection outbreak ended in Korea, it was proposed that the infected patients, quarantined individuals, healthcare workers, and public require emotional care and support during an infectious disease outbreak.",
            "To the best of our knowledge, the detailed mental health problems of the patients infected with COVID-19 pneumonia and healthcare workers treating the infected patients have not yet been reported. However, it is suggested that both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients may experience the fear of the consequences of this infection, including death and severe physical disability. Furthermore, boredom, loneliness, and anger could be experienced by individuals in quarantine. It is also suggested that anxiety symptoms and distress may be worsened not only by the infection symptoms, but also by the adverse effects of the treatment. The infectious disease outbreaks commonly cause anxiety and fear, uncertainty, and stigmatization that can be prevented by medical and psychiatric treatment.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] The need for mental health care during the COVID-19 outbreak has been emphasized in Korea. Since 528 and 173 Koreans who escaped from Wuhan due to the COVID-19 outbreak in China have been quarantined in Asan and Jincheon, respectively, in Korea, the mental health professionals, including psychiatrists from the National Mental Health Center have been deployed to provide psychological counseling to individuals in quarantine. Moreover, mental health care services for the COVID-19 outbreak are being provided by national hospitals and community mental health centers throughout the country. The National Center for Disaster Trauma distributed leaflets promoting mental health care against the distress caused by infectious disease outbreaks.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] According to this leaflet,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] somatic symptoms, in-"
