            "Specific areas have been set aside inside designated hospitals to provide services according to the severity of the disease. Suspected and confirmed cases are given diagnostic and treatment facilities in an isolated and protected environment; however, individuals in a critical condition are given treatment on a priority basis. In some cases, allopathic medicines are advised in combination with Chinese medicine such as Huoxiangzhengqi (for gastrointestinal problems), Jinhua Qinggan, Lianhua Qingjia, Shufengjiedu and Fangfengtongsheng (for fatigue and fever). Psychological counselling is now available to handle the anxiety and fear among patients. Confirmed patients have been given access to the internet and provided with healthy food; communication with relatives is through mobile video calls. Online assistance using a video chat between doctor and patient (suspected or confirmed) is also used in some hospitals. Some doctors and nurses prefer to communicate via mobile phone rather than direct contacting with the admitted patient. Patients are discharged and sent back home in protected and disinfected vehicles after they have recovered from the fever, respiratory symptoms are improved and the nucleic acid test is negative.",
            "Despite these services, new suspected and/or confirmed individuals are facing problems. The scarcity of sickbeds is causing confirmed patients to wait for a long time before they are admitted to a hospital, while the availability of sickbeds depends on recovery of already admitted patients. However, failure to provide admitted patients with protection measures such as goggles and suits, the shortage of medicines and the lack of isolated rooms are negatively affecting the recovery of patients. In some places, rapid measurement kits are not available. A pharyngeal swab-based test needs to be repeated for confirmation, which delays the process of admitting infected patients. This may increase the severity of symptoms and the risk of fatality. Some of the infected individuals were found to have mild symptoms and rather than admitting them they were offered therapy and were advised to stay in isolated rooms. To cope with the increasing number of infected people, two new hospitals are nearing completion and will be able to house about 2300 beds [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. However, the daily the numbers of confirmed and suspected cases are increasing in the thousands, thus raising concern about future treatment and management strategies.",
            "Scientists in China are working efficiently, as observed by the early detection of the virus, sequencing of its first genome, designing of rapid detection kits, isolation of the virus in the laboratory and developing a vaccine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. A group of researchers in the Wuhan Institute of Virology is studying the genome complexity, which may lead to uncovering unique structural features and drug target sites. Moreover, research groups from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Academy of Military Medical Sciences have identified some broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that may have potential inhibitory effects against 2019-nCoV.

            "University of Science and Technology and several other laboratories in Wuhan and across the country are working to find ways of prevention and treatment in order to prevent further spread. Broad range combinational therapies including lopinavireritonavir and interferon antiviral peptides are being evaluated for use against 2019n-CoV.",
            "Overall the current measures to control the 2019n-CoV are being implemented with care and strictness. The entrances of residential communities, dormitories and public places are restricted and residents entering are monitored for temperature and related symptoms. People from Wuhan are registered and kept under medical observation in some cities in China; meanwhile, their suspected contacts may be tracked to isolate them for monitoring purposes. Farmers are being directed to maintain hygiene, and seafood markets are being monitored in major cities."

            "There is a great risk of medical and clinical staff becoming infected with 2019n-CoV because of their direct interaction with infected and suspected individuals.",
            "A total of 15 medical staff have been infected, and one doctor has died from 2019n-CoV infection in Wuhan hospital [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "At Hubei General Hospital, a large number of clinical workers have been infected and admitted to the hospital; some of them have asked to be isolated at",
            "The Department of Cerebrovascular Diseases, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.",
            "Every day the dramatic increase in the number of infected individuals is causing a huge burden on the medical staff.",
            "S. Khan et al / Clinical Microbiology and Infection xxx xxx the coming days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] may cause a further shortage of medical staff and health and logistic issues for the frontline healthcare provider.",
            "Suspected and confirmed cases are given diagnostic and treatment facilities in an isolated and protected environment; individuals in a critical condition are given treatment on a priority basis.",
            "Some doctors and nurses prefer to communicate via mobile phone rather than direct contacting with the admitted patient.",
            "The scarcity of sickbeds is causing confirmed patients to wait for a long time before they are admitted to a hospital, while the availability of sickbeds depends on recovery of already admitted patients.",
            "Failure to provide admitted patients with protection measures such as goggles and suits, the shortage of medicines and the lack of isolated rooms are negatively affecting the recovery of patients.",
            "Some of the infected individuals were found to have mild symptoms and rather than admitting them they were offered therapy and were advised to stay in isolated rooms.",
            "The daily the numbers of confirmed and suspected cases are increasing in the thousands, raising concern about future treatment and management strategies."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Scientists in China are working efficiently, as observed by the early detection of the virus, sequencing of its first genome, designing of rapid detection kits, isolation of the virus in the laboratory and developing a vaccine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",
            "Research groups from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Academy of Military Medical Sciences have identified some broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that may have potential inhibitory effects against 2019-nCoV.",
            "People from Wuhan are registered and kept under medical observation in some cities in China; their suspected contacts may be tracked to isolate them for monitoring purposes."
