It presents reference ranges for respiratory rate, heart rate, core body temperature, blood biochemistry and hematology, and a comprehensive formulary of therapeutic agents used to treat pangolins. It also discusses bacterial, protozoan, viral and parasitic organisms known for pangolins, but there is little knowledge of the health impact of infection with these organisms. Non-infectious diseases commonly seen in captive pangolins include respiratory disease, trauma and gastrointestinal ulceration. There remain significant gaps in knowledge of pangolin health, with little, if any, information on the Philippine, black-bellied and giant pangolins.",
