            "Zoonotic viral infections are more frequently crossing species to infect human populations. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus was transmitted to humans from exotic animals in wet markets in China, and in 2015, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus was transmitted from camels in Saudi Arabia. In both cases, and with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak in China, the original host of the virus is likely to be bats.",
            "The 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as such with the use of electron microscope analysis, to determine its shape, and genomic sequencing. The virus causes an aspecific respiratory syndrome and a generalised inflammatory response in humans. Patient zero was likely to have been infected by 2019-nCoV at a seafood market in Wuhan (Hubei province, China)\u2014 WHO has provided the case definition. Although the information surrounding the current situation is changing on a daily basis, transparency and consistent data through official channels for the international scientific community is highly recommended. Experts provide their opinion based on experience and current information, but the basic rep\u00ad rod\u00aduction number (R0)\u2014ie, the number of cases generated by one case\u2014is presently unclear, and data about mortality are inconsistent. Both in Europe and the USA, close attention is being paid to the problem despite the apparent low risk of an immediate epidemic diffusion."
