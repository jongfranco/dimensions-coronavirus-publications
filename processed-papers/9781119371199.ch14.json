They are columbid alphaherpesvirus\u20101 (CoHV\u20101), avian nephritis, arbovirus infections, turkey viral hepatitis, avian encephalomyelitis, and avian hepatitis E virus infections. CoHV\u20101 infection is a common disease of pigeons (Columba livia) that are the natural host. Clinical diagnosis is based on the observation of typical gross lesions and clinical signs. Environmental factors, CoHV\u20101 infection, and secondary parasitological and bacteriological infections contribute to the development and severity of acute and chronic respiratory diseases. The final diagnosis should always include specific parasitological (Trichomonas columbae) and bacteriological (Staphylococcus intermedius, Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli, etc.) examinations since primary CoHV\u20101 infections are frequently complicated by these agents, which must be considered if support treatment is to be successful.",
