            "Na+/K+\u2010ATPase classically serves as an ion pump maintaining an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane that is essential for transepithelial transport, nutrient uptake, and membrane potential. In addition, Na+/K+\u2010ATPase also functions as a receptor, a signal transducer, and a cell adhesion molecule. Many pump\u2010independent and evolutionarily conserved functions for Na+/K+\u2010ATPase proteins have been described, and recent studies have shown that \u03b1 or \u03b2\u2010subunit of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase is involved in HIV\u20101, enterovirus 71, coronavirus, IAV/IBV, and HCMV infection.9-12, 32 However, the function of ATP1B3 on HBV is still unknown. To address the roles of ATP1B3 in HBV replication, overexpression and silencing of ATP1B3 were performed in hepatic cells to evaluate its effect on HBV replication. We confirm that ATP1B3 could suppress HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2 cells (Figures 1 and 2). And this is the first time to prove that ATP1B3 is involved in DNA virus replication. With the consideration of ATP1B3 on Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity, we also prove that the restriction function of ATP1B3 on HBV is independent of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity by using Na+/K+\u2010ATPase inhibitor (data not shown). Our works exploit the novel function of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase subunit."

            "ATP1B3 (also designated as CD298), as one of three regulatory \u03b2\u2010subunits of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase, was first identified and characterized in 1998.7 Previous studies suggested that ATP1B3 was not only involved in the Na+/K+ pump activity, but also in regulation of T\u2010cell activation independent Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity.8 Interestingly, recent studies reported the involvement of \u03b2\u2010subunit of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase in some virus infections. ATP1B1 was identified as a partner of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL136 protein as well as M2 proteins of influenza A and B viruses.9, 10 ATP1B3 was found to reduce BST\u20102\u2010mediated restriction of human immunodeficiency virus 1 production in Hela cells.11 Inversely, ATP1B3 was shown to interact with the 3A protein of Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and inhibit EV71 replication by enhancing the production of type\u2010I IFN.12 BST\u20102 was identified as an IFN\u2010inducible antiviral protein that blocked the release of various enveloped viruses, such as HIV, Lassa, Marburg, and Ebola at the plasma membrane.13, 14 It was constitutively expressed in HepG2, HeLa, H9, Jurkat, primary T lymphocytes, and macrophages, but was absent from 293T, HOS, and HT1080 cells. In 2015, Yan et al15 reported that BST\u20102 directly and selectively inhibited the secretion of HBV virions, but not subviral particles or nonenveloped capsids in hepatocyte\u2010derived cells. And Miyakawa et al16 revealed that HBs could interact with BST\u20102 via its fourth transmembrane domain thereby inhibiting its dimerization and antiviral activity. Recently, our team proved that BST\u20102 tethered the nascent HBV virions at the plasma membrane. But there seems to be no obvious relationship between BST\u20102 and HBV production, which occurs in intracellular vesicles. Recently, the interaction of ATP1B3 and BST\u20102 was identified by using the yeast two\u2010hybrid screen.11 Hence, we are interested in discovering whether ATP1B3 is involved in HBV propagation and whether there is any relationship between ATP1B3 and BST\u20102 on HBV propagation. In the present study, we first characterized ATP1B3 as a novel host restrictor for HBV replication by nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB)/IFN\u2010\u03b1 and NF\u2010\u03baB/interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) pathway.

            "Previous studies revealed that ATP1B3 was involved in HIV\u20101 or EV71 infection.11, 12 To investigate the effect of ATP1B3 on HBV propagation, 400 ng pCMV ayw HBV and 400 ng ATP1B3 plasmids or 400 ng empty control plasmids were cotransfected into HepG2 cells (Figure 1Aa). The exogenetic ATP1B3 presented three bands on Western blot because of two N\u2010linked glycosylation. ATP1B3 expression significantly reduced the amount of HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2 supernatants to approximately 20% of the control (Figure 1Ab). When 200 to 800 ng ATP1b3 cotransfected with 400 ng pCMV ayw HBV, ELISA results indicated that ATP1B3 suppressed HBV antigen in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Figure 1Ba,b). To exclude unspecific effect, 400 ng pCMV\u2010HBV or pHBV1.3 and 400 ng ATP1B3 plasmids or 400 ng empty control plasmids were cotransfected into HepG2 cells. ELISA assay indicated that ATP1B3 expression also reduced the amount of HBsAg and HBeAg (or HBcAg) in HepG2 supernatants (Figure 1C and 1D).",
            "Contribution of ATP1B3 on HBV restriction was evaluated by using siRNA knockdown. Compared with overexpressed ATP1B3, endogenous ATP1B3 presented one band corresponding to full glycosylated form on Western blot. As shown in Figure 2A, siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of endogenous ATP1B3 drastically enhanced the amount of HBsAg and HBeAg in the supernatant of HepG2 cells. A similar observation was obtained in shRNA\u2010mediated ATP1B3 silencing HepG2 cells (Figure 2B). To exclude the possibility of ATP1B3 overexpression or silencing on cell proliferation, cell viability was determined on transient transfection and shRNA\u2010mediated silencing cells for 72 hours.

        "3.2 NF\u2010\u03baB activation is crucial for ATP1B3\u2010induced HBV restriction": [
            "The NF\u2010\u03baB family of transcription factors is a key regulator of immune development, immune responses, inflammation, and viral restriction. To illuminate the mechanism of ATP1B3 restriction on HBV, the effect of ATP1B3 on NF\u2010\u03baB activation was examined by luciferase reporter assay in HepG2 cells. We observed that ATP1B3 activated NF\u2010\u03baB in a dose\u2010dependent manner. And HBV slightly influenced NF\u2010\u03baB activation of ATP1B3 (Figure 3A). Nuclear and cytoplasmic separation experiment confirmed ATP1B3\u2010induced NF\u2010\u03baB activation. NF\u2010\u03baB subunit P65 expression increased in nucleus and cytoplasm under ATP1B3 expression. More phosphorylated P65 translocated into the nucleus induced by ATP1B3 in hepatocyte than the control group (Figure 3B).",
            "TAK1 carries out diverse biological roles including NF\u2010\u03baB activation.24 Here, TAK1 was transfected into shRNA\u2010mediated ATP1B3 silencing HepG2 and control cells (Figure 3Ca). As shown in Figure 3Cb, NF\u2010\u03baB activation was strongly restrained in shRNA\u2010mediated ATP1B3 silencing cells. Meanwhile, the effect of TAK1 expression on HBV has been tested. In control cells, HBsAg and HBeAg were significantly downregulated after TAK1 expression and NF\u2010\u03baB activation. However, HBV replication was recovered in shRNA\u2010mediated ATP1B3 silencing cells (Figure 3Cc). On the other hand, NF\u2010\u03baB inhibitor Bay11 was employed to confirm the effect of NF\u2010\u03baB inhibition on HBsAg and HBeAg reduction. Figure 3D showed that 10 \u03bcM Bay11 had partially restored the quantity of HBsAg and HBeAg in supernatants but not completely. We speculated that ATP1B3 could restrain HBV via NF\u2010\u03baB activation and another unknown way.",
            "The NF\u2010\u03baB/IFNs and NF\u2010\u03baB/cytokines act as the key axis in the innate immune response against HBV infection,25 which has implicated to endogenous antiviral ISGs production. The type\u2010I to \u2010III IFNs, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20106 act as the key effectors in the innate immune response against HBV infection.26-29 Hence, ATP1B3\u2010induced IFN (IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2, IL\u201028A, and IL\u201029) and cytokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106) expression were determined by RT\u2010PCR and ELISA. As shown in Figure 4A, ATP1B3 strongly upregulated IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106 expression in HepG2 cells. Four antiviral ISGs, which might involve in different stages of HBV infection, ISG\u201015, ISG\u201056, OAS2, and BST\u20102 were investigated. It was shown that ATP1B3 could obviously induce OAS2 and BST\u20102, but not ISG\u201015 and ISG\u201056 expression (Figure 4B), and OAS2 might have no impact on HBV replication (data not shown). Since BST\u20102 was reported to be likely to inhibit HBV particle release,17, 30 we speculated that ATP1B3\u2010induced BST\u20102 expression could contribute to the suppression function on HBV antigen. Hence, IFN\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced BST\u20102 expression in hepatocyte (HepG2) and nonhepatocyte (HEK293T) was investigated (Figure 4C). As it is known, BST\u20102 is a type\u2010II transmembrane protein with 180 amino acids (approximately 19 kDa). However, previous studies indicated that endogenously expressed BST\u20102 protein contained complex carbohydrate modifications and presented as a smear of multiple 20 to 30 kDa bands due to its N\u2010glycosylation.31 Compared with HEK293T cells, BST\u20102 expression was remarkably upregulated by IFN\u2010\u03b1 in HepG2 cells. And siRNA\u2010mediated ATP1B3 knockdown attenuated messenger RNA level of BST\u20102 in HepG2 cells (Figure 4D), which supported the conclusion that as an IFN\u2010inducible antiviral protein, endogenous BST\u20102 expression was downregulated due to the reduced IFNs production by ATP1B3 shutdown. Hence, we concluded that ATP1B3 could induce BST\u20102 via NF\u2010\u03baB/IFNs axis to promote HBV inhibition in hepatocyte."

        "3.4 ATP1B3 cooperates with BST\u20102 to promote HBsAg restriction": [
            "As we know, BST\u20102 can impair the secretion of HBV virions by interacting with HBsAg.15, 16 And ATP1B3 could interact with BST\u20102 on cytomembrane.11 To prove the cooperation of ATP1B3 and BST\u20102 on HBV restriction, we investigated the suppression effect of ATP1B3 on HBV in BST\u20102\u2010negative cell, HEK293T.17 Figure 5A showed that ATP1B3 expression reduced the amount of HBsAg and HBeAg in culture supernatants of HEK293T cells, indicating that the restriction of ATP1B3 on HBV was independent of BST\u20102. The restriction of ATP1B3 on HBsAg production in BST\u20102\u2010positive cell, HepG2, was stronger than that in BST\u20102\u2010negative HEK293T cells, indicating that BST\u20102 might be a cooperator for HBsAg restriction in hepatocyte. To confirm the inhibition of ATP1B3 on HBV via NF\u2010\u03baB/IFN\u2010\u03b1/BST\u20102 axis, NF\u2010\u03baB inhibitor Bay11 was used to investigate the effect of ATP1B3 on BST\u20102 expression. As shown in Figure 5B, ATP1B3\u2010induced endogenous BST\u20102 expression, but Bay11 impaired the function of ATP1B3.",
            "To further reveal the synergetic effect of ATP1B3 and BST\u20102 on HBsAg restriction, HEK293T cells were transfected with ATP1B3 plus the empty vector or BST\u20102 as indicated in Figure 5Ca. It showed that ATP1B3 with BST\u20102 resulted in approximately 90% inhibition of HBsAg in HEK293T cells (Figure 5Cb). Exogenous BST\u20102 enhanced the HBsAg restriction of ATP1B3 in BST\u20102\u2010negative cells. On the other hand, we found that the HBsAg restriction of ATP1B3 was significantly rescued in si\u2010BST\u20102\u2010treated HepG2 cells (Figure 5D). These findings further confirm that the restriction of ATP1B3 on HBeAg is BST\u20102 independent, but ATP1B3 cooperates with BST\u20102 to promote HBsAg restriction."

        "4 DISCUSSION": [
            "Na+/K+\u2010ATPase classically serves as an ion pump maintaining an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane that is essential for transepithelial transport, nutrient uptake, and membrane potential. In addition, Na+/K+\u2010ATPase also functions as a receptor, a signal transducer, and a cell adhesion molecule. Many pump\u2010independent and evolutionarily conserved functions for Na+/K+\u2010ATPase proteins have been described, and recent studies have shown that \u03b1 or \u03b2\u2010subunit of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase is involved in HIV\u20101, enterovirus 71, coronavirus, IAV/IBV, and HCMV infection.9-12, 32 However, the function of ATP1B3 on HBV is still unknown. To address the roles of ATP1B3 in HBV replication, overexpression and silencing of ATP1B3 were performed in hepatic cells to evaluate its effect on HBV replication. We confirm that ATP1B3 could suppress HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2 cells (Figures 1 and 2). And this is the first time to prove that ATP1B3 is involved in DNA virus replication. With the consideration of ATP1B3 on Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity, we also prove that the restriction function of ATP1B3 on HBV is independent of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase activity by using Na+/K+\u2010ATPase inhibitor (data not shown). Our works exploit the novel function of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase subunit.",
            "NF\u2010\u03baB is an important transcriptional regulator of inflammatory cytokines and proteins. It plays a key role in regulating the immune response to infection. Here, we prove and report that ATP1B3 expression could activate NF\u2010\u03baB pathway by inducing the expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear import of P65 for the first time. TAK1 is a key regulator of the innate immunity and the proinflammatory signaling pathway. In response to IL\u20101, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and toll\u2010like receptor agonists, it mediates the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB, c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal kinase, and p38 pathways.33 In addition, TAK1 has been proved to represent an intrinsic host restriction factor for HBV replication in hepatocytes.34 Similar to ATP1B3, TAK1 can activate NF\u2010\u03baB and antagonize HBV. This suggests the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway is important in HBV replication. Hence, in Figure 3C(c), HBsAg and HBeAg were significantly downregulated following TAK1 expression and NF\u2010\u03baB activation in control cells. Although HBV replication recovered because of shRNA\u2010mediated ATP1B3 silencing, TAK1 overexpression still showed an anti\u2010HBV effect to some extent.",
            "Previous evidence on the relationship between NF\u2010\u03baB activation and IFN production has been provided.35 Type\u2010I to \u2010III IFNs are known to act as key effectors in the innate immune response against HBV infection. Moreover, IFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment is licensed for hepatitis B therapy and has resulted in virus clearance in some patients. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of the IFN\u2010based therapeutics is still not clear. Here, we examined the novel function of ATP1B3 on NF\u2010\u03baB activation as well as the production of type\u2010I to \u2010III IFNs. The results show that ATP1B3 could activate the NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway (Figure 3), and upregulate the production of IFN\u2010\u03b1, and finally upregulate antiviral associated ISGs (OAS2 and BST\u20102) in cells (Figure 4). Another evidence for ATP1B3 activating NF\u2010\u03baB is that ATP1B3 weakly activates HBV promoter S1P, S2P, and XP (data not shown). NF\u2010\u03baB has already been associated with HBV transcription, however, the weak activation on HBV promoter cannot help virus replication at all.",
            "Actually, our previous studies have reported that BST\u20102, working as a host defensive factor, suppressed HBV release by physically tethering nascent virions on the cell membrane and resulted in significantly reducing HBsAg expression in supernatants of BST\u20102\u2010positive cell lines.17, 30 Therefore we speculate that ATP1B3 coordinates with BST\u20102 to inhibit HBV antigen. We find ATP1B3 still inhibits HBV antigen in BST\u20102\u2010negative HEK293T cells, indicating that the restriction of ATP1B3 on HBV is BST\u20102\u2010independent (Figure 5A). Interestingly, it is found that ATP1B3 expression could increase the protein level of BST\u20102 in cells (Figure 5B). Since BST\u20102 has been identified as an ATP1B3\u2010binding protein in Hela cells,11 we surmised that ATP1B3 might enhance the stability of BST\u20102 by protein binding. Results in Figure 5C and 5D completely confirm the synergistic effect between ATP1B3 and BST\u20102 on HBsAg restriction. These results help us to well understand the HBV restriction mechanism of ATP1B3 by activates NF\u2010\u03baB/IFNs axis. Indeed, IFNs have been demonstrated to be effective against infection caused by many viruses, such as influenza A virus,36, 37 hepatitis C virus,38 and coxsackievirus A16.25 Hence, the specificity of ATP1B3 antivirus function needs to be investigated in the future.",
            "Our work first identifies ATP1B3 as a novel host factor for HBV restriction. For the anti\u2010HBV mechanism, ATP1B3 activates NF\u2010\u03baB/IFN\u2010\u03b1 and NF\u2010\u03baB/IL\u20106 axis to attenuate HBV propagation. Through IFN\u2010\u03b1 stimulation, ATP1B3 cooperates with ISG BST\u20102, resulting in a synergistic effect to enhance inhibitory on HBsAg but not HBeAg. In summary, our work highlights ATP1B3 as a potential therapeutic molecule in HBV infection. The role of the \u03b2\u2010subunit family of Na+/K+\u2010ATPase in virus infection is also suggested to be worthy of further investigations."
