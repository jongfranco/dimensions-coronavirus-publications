        "abstract": "Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread from China to 25 countries. Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country\u2019s health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19.",

            "Early detection of COVID-19 importation and prevention of onward transmission are crucial challenges to all countries at risk of importation from areas with active transmission in China. 12 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America have already reported secondary spread following importation. Onward transmission potentially occurring in countries with weaker health systems is a major public health concern.<br/><br/>We show that the risk of importation to African countries is highly heterogeneous, with Egypt, Algeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Nigeria estimated to be at highest risk. We also identified that part of this heterogeneity in Africa depended on the distribution of cases within Chinese provinces. Although certain provinces in China are www.thelancet.com Published online February 19, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30411-6<br/><br/>currently the largest contributors to the risk of specific clusters of countries, enhanced surveillance at airports should con\u00adsider that importation might still occur from provinces that appear to have a lower probability in our estima\u00adtions. Moreover, shifts in local and widespread transmission in Beijing, Guangdong, and Fujian could have profound implications for risk in Africa. For example, a signifi\u00adcantly higher incidence in Guangdong than in other provinces would have a greater effect on the importation risk of countries in the second cluster than in countries in the other clusters. Flight bans implemented by some African airline companies serving China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] might alter future risk through a different repartition of the flow of travel; however, these bans are not expected to prevent importations.

Previous and current evidence indicates that realistic travel restrictions would have a limited effect in containing the epidemic and would delay the risk that the outbreak extends to new countries by only a few weeks.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Travel or trade restrictions are not currently recommended by WHO.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]"

We further assessed, using multiple indicators, how the capacity to respond varies across the countries identified at risk.

            "On Jan 30, 2020, WHO declared the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] As of Feb 11, 2020, the epidemic registered 42 708 cases in China and spread to 25 countries that reported a total of 395 cases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] Limited local transmission outside China was reported in Germany, France, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and the USA.",
            "All continents reported confirmed cases of COVID-19. Africa confirmed its first case in Egypt on Feb 14, 2020. China is Africa\u2019s leading commercial part\u00adner; thus, there are large travel volumes through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 could reach the continent. Several measures have already been implemented to prevent and control possible case importations from China;[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] however, the ability to limit and control local transmission after importation depends on the application and execution of strict measures of detection, prevention, and control. These measures include heightened surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, followed by patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing, and follow-up of potential contacts.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on each country\u2019s public health and laboratory infra\u00ad structures and resources.",
            "We assessed the risk of importation of cases of COVID-19 to Africa from affected provinces in China, and contextualised this risk with each country\u2019s vulner\u00ad ability to epidemic emergencies and capacity to respond. Importation risk was determined by the volume of air traffic connections[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] from areas where the virus currently circulates in China. Each country\u2019s functional capacity to manage health security issues is based on WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (MEF),[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] and on an indicator of vulnerability to emerging epidemics."

            "Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa were the countries at highest importation risk from China, with moderate to high SPAR capacity scores (87, 76, and 62, respectively) and IDVI (53, 49, and 69, respectively; figures 2, 3). Countries with the second highest importation risk ranking included Nigeria and Ethiopia, with moderate capacity (51 and 67, respectively), but high vulnerability (27 and 38, respec\u00ad tively), and substantially larger populations potentially exposed (figure 1). Morocco, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya had similar moderate importation risk and population sizes; however, these countries presented variable levels of capacity (ranging from 34 to 75) and an",

            "Three clusters were identified among the countries with non-negligible risk (figure 4). Each of the clusters corresponded to different Chinese airports as the main source of entry risk. Cluster number 1 was highly exposed to Beijing, and moderately exposed to Guangdong province and Shanghai; cluster number 3 (including Botswana and Lesotho only) was exposed exclusively to the potential risk from airports in the Fujian province; and cluster number 2 was heavily exposed to risk from Guangdong province and weakly to Zhejiang province (figure 4).",

        "Discussion": [
            "Early detection of COVID-19 importation and prevention of onward transmission are crucial challenges to all countries at risk of importation from areas with active transmission in China. 12 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America have already reported secondary spread following importation. Onward transmission potentially occurring in countries with weaker health systems is a major public health concern.",
            "We show that the risk of importation to African countries is highly heterogeneous, with Egypt, Algeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Nigeria estimated to be at highest risk. We also identified that part of this heterogeneity in Africa depended on the distribution of cases within Chinese provinces. Although certain provinces in China are www.thelancet.com Published online February 19, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30411-6",
            "currently the largest contributors to the risk of specific clusters of countries, enhanced surveillance at airports should con\u00adsider that importation might still occur from provinces that appear to have a lower probability in our estima\u00adtions. Moreover, shifts in local and widespread transmission in Beijing, Guangdong, and Fujian could have profound implications for risk in Africa. For example, a signifi\u00adcantly higher incidence in Guangdong than in other provinces would have a greater effect on the importation risk of countries in the second cluster than in countries in the other clusters. Flight bans implemented by some African airline companies serving China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] might alter future risk through a different repartition of the flow of travel; however, these bans are not expected to prevent importations. Not all connections between Africa and China have been cut\u2014the main transporters continue to fly between the two (eg, Ethiopian Airlines, the largest carrier in Africa, operating almost half of the flights from Africa to China,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] together with all Chinese airline companies, and others). Previous and current evidence indicates that realistic travel restrictions would have a limited effect in containing the epidemic and would delay the risk that the outbreak extends to new countries by only a few weeks.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Travel or trade restrictions are not currently recommended by WHO.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]",
            "Algeria, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Nigeria were part of the 13 top priority countries identified by WHO on the basis of their direct links and volume of travel to China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Egypt, which we estimated to be at highest risk, was not part of that list, although Cairo was identified as the African airport with the highest passenger volume from the affected areas.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Few other discrepancies were observed (Morocco and Angola were estimated to be at moderate risk, but did not appear in WHO\u2019s 13 top priority list) that might be explained by different risk estimation approaches. In our assessment, we accounted for the distribution of incidence within China and the volume of travel from China with the passenger network. This assessment strongly affects the spatial pattern in the risk of importation. In addition, we considered full origin\u2013 destination itineraries as opposed to direct flights only. Yet our data do not allow us to distinguish between travel for tourism or business, or across nationalities of passengers. Contrary to Europe, where most cases among initial importations were Chinese tourists travelling for holiday, cases in Africa might be more likely to be business than travel related, given the strong commercial links between African countries and China.",
            "An insufficiency of passenger data (eg, reason for travel [tourism vs business], nationality, age, sex, and socio\u00ad economic status) also prevent us from accounting for different risk exposure of travellers to China. Travel flow data to estimate risk have already been validated against confirmed imported cases,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] indicating that homogeneous assumpt\u00adions on travellers\u2019 profiles and risk of exposure in China are enough to explain the exportations reported so far.",
            "Countries at the highest risk of importation, based on the current epidemic situation in China, had moderate to high capacity scores; however, these scores might correspond to different contributions to the mean SPAR indicators, reflecting different aspects of a country\u2019s functional capacity. For example, South Africa had the maximum score for laboratory capacity (100), but a low score in risk communication (20). Conversely, Nigeria had a low score in the laboratory capacity (27) and the maximum score in the IHR Coordination capacity (100). Conversely, countries with the lowest SPAR capacity score (ie, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ghana) had moderate to low importation risk. The evaluation of additional factors (ie, demographic, socioeconomic, and political factors) included in the IDVI that might influence the overall potential effect of an unfolding epidemic identified several countries that had a significant import\u00adation risk with a low to medium IDVI, such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Algeria. The risk of importation from other points of entry, such as seaports, was not evaluated.",
            "Our results should be interpreted carefully. The overall risk of importation to Africa is lower than that to Europe (1% vs 11%, respectively, according to our estimates on the current situation), but response and reaction capacity are also lower. The overall SPAR score and IDVI of African countries are linked to their overall wealth, and are generally significantly lower than many high-income countries with higher overall resources for detection, prevention, and control. Comparatively, China has a SPAR score of 93 and an IDVI of 63.",
            "African countries have recently strengthened their preparedness against COVID-19 importations.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] Many countries have improved airport surveillance and imple\u00ad mented temperature screening at ports of entry,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] thanks to equipment that was readily available following the 2013\u201316 Ebola epidemic, including high-risk countries according to our analysis\u2014South Africa, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, with the latter also interviewing passengers arriving from China. Overall recommendations to avoid travel to China have been issued (eg, by the Ministry of Health of Nigeria). Communication campaigns have been intensified after the publication of WHO guidelines encouraging the provision of information to health professionals and the general public, often with 24 h dedicated hotlines, as in the case of Senegal.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]",
            "Some countries remain ill-equipped. Some are without the diagnostic capacity for rapid testing for the virus; thus, if cases are imported, tests will need to be done abroad, which might critically increase the delay from identification of suspected cases to their confirmation and isolation, affecting possible disease transmission. WHO is currently supporting countries to improve their diagnostic capacity. In the African region, this capacity has now expanded from just two referral laboratories[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] to a larger set of countries, and is expected to continue to increase in the upcoming weeks.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] The capacity of these laboratories is still limited by the shortage of personnel www.thelancet.com Published online February 19, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30411-6",

It is essential to train, equip, and strengthen the diagnostic capacities of hospital laboratories close to infectious disease and emergency departments to reduce the time to deliver results, manage confirmed cases and contacts more rapidly, and preserve strict infection control measures.",
            "In the African region, resources to set up quarantine rooms for suspected cases at airports and hospitals, or to trace contacts of confirmed cases, as recommended by WHO, might be scarce. 74% of countries in Africa have an influenza pandemic preparedness plan; however, most are outdated (prior to the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic) and considered inadequate to deal with a global pandemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] Countries might not have the same capacity to manage repatriations of nationals (eg, African students) from the province of Hubei in China, as done by high-income countries, because of a scarcity of resources, including personnel, centres, and equipment for quaran\u00adtine and isolation. The epidemic in China highlights the rapid saturation of the hospital capacity if the outbreak is not contained. Increasing the number of available beds and supplies in resource-limited countries is crucial in preparation for possible local transmission following importation.",
            "The aftermath of recent epidemics and pandemics (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 pandemic, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Ebola) have highlighted the need to reinforce national public health capabilities and infrastructures, including diseasesurveillance systems and laboratory networks, as well as human capacity (eg, training in surveillance, epidemic response, and diagnostic testing).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] National public health capabilities and infrastructures remain at the core of global health security, because they are the first line of defence in infectious disease emergencies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] Crisis management plans should be ready in each African country; involvement of the international community should catalyse such preparedness. Our findings should help to inform urgent prioritisation for intensified support for preparedness and response in specific African countries found to be at moderate to high risk of importation of COVID-19 and with relatively low capacity to manage the health emergency.",
