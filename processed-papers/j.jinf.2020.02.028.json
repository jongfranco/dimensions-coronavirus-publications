Efforts should be taken to reduce the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 both in pregnant and perinatal period, and more intensive attention should be paid to pregnant patients.

We focused on the pregnant COVID19 patients. Given the maternal physiologic and immune function changes in pregnancy[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], pregnant individuals might face greater risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2 and might have more complicated clinical events. We described epidemiological, clinical characteristics, pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of all hospitalized pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in China."
