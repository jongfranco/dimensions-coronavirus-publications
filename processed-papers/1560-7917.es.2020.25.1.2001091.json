        "abstract": "One memorable event was the worldwide movement of young people for the climate. Even if not directly related to infectious disease prevention and control, it reminded us of our collective obligation to the upcoming generations. Disease prevention is about improving future health outcomes. Continuous vigilance and surveillance are necessary elements in ensuring the best possible protection of the heath of the population as a whole. Pathogens continue to evolve in their ability to cause human disease. This was demonstrated by the recent detection of pneumonia cases of unknown origin in Wuhan, China since mid-December, for which an unknown, novel corona virus has been preliminarily determined as the cause [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. An example of how pathogens are able to escape tools and technologies developed to control and stop their spread is antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR has been a worldwide concern for some time already and has featured prominently in Eurosurveillance. In 2019, we covered various aspects of AMR such as the emergence of multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae related to international travel [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a German hospital [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and the surveillance of antimicrobial consumption and prescribing for example in Belgium, Israel and Switzerland [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Another aspect driving spread and severity of communicable diseases is human behaviour. The continued spread of measles in Europe over the past decade has been facilitated by insufficient vaccine coverage in specific population groups or regions. Over the past year, vaccine hesitancy and mandatory vaccination were covered in several Eurosurveillance articles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] as were interventions to improve confidence in vaccines, for example, motivational interviews conducted with parents of newborns on maternity wards in Canada resulted in lower hesitancy and greater intention to vaccinate [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",

            "One memorable event was the worldwide movement of young people for the climate. Even if not directly related to infectious disease prevention and control, it reminded us of our collective obligation to the upcoming generations. Disease prevention is about improving future health outcomes. Continuous vigilance and surveillance are necessary elements in ensuring the best possible protection of the heath of the population as a whole. Pathogens continue to evolve in their ability to cause human disease. This was demonstrated by the recent detection of pneumonia cases of unknown origin in Wuhan, China since mid-December, for which an unknown, novel corona virus has been preliminarily determined as the cause [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. An example of how pathogens are able to escape tools and technologies developed to control and stop their spread is antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR has been a worldwide concern for some time already and has featured prominently in Eurosurveillance. In 2019, we covered various aspects of AMR such as the emergence of multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae related to international travel [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a German hospital [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and the surveillance of antimicrobial consumption and prescribing for example in Belgium, Israel and Switzerland [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Another aspect driving spread and severity of communicable diseases is human behaviour. The continued spread of measles in Europe over the past decade has been facilitated by insufficient vaccine coverage in specific population groups or regions. Over the past year, vaccine hesitancy and mandatory vaccination were covered in several Eurosurveillance articles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] as were interventions to improve confidence in vaccines, for example, motivational interviews conducted with parents of newborns on maternity wards in Canada resulted in lower hesitancy and greater intention to vaccinate [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",
            "As usual, food- and waterborne diseases, HIV/AIDS and blood-borne diseases, emerging and vector-borne diseases, influenza and other respiratory diseases were the subject of several articles in the categories, \u2018Outbreak reports\u2019 and \u2018Surveillance articles\u2019. These two article types have different structures and collectively replaced the former category \u2018Surveillance and outbreak reports\u2019 at the beginning of 2019. The associated new instructions for authors have led to greater consistency and completeness of information in submissions in these article categories."
