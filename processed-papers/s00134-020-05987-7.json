The SARS-CoV-2 disease was officially given the name of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 11 February, 2020. In this study, we examine which treatments are being used, assess clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in intensive care unit (ICU).",

            "Our results suggest that ICU patients suffer at admission from more comorbidities and develop many complications due to hospitalization. During hospitalization they receive more aggressive treatment, and can result in a similar mortality when compared to non-ICU patients. We found that 17.6% of patients required admission to the ICU and 16.7% died. A previous study including 138 patients with COVID-19 showed that 26% of patients required admission to the ICU and 4.3% died [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Another study reported that 23% of patients with COVID-19 required admission to the ICU and 11.0% died [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. It should be noted that most patients in those two studies were still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Our hospital is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals and is responsible for the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Thus, our cohort might represent the more severe COVID-19 patients and the rates of death and ICU admission may be overestimated. A recent large-sample and multicenter study showed that only 5% of the included COVID-19 patients were admitted to ICU and 1.36% succumbed [5]."
