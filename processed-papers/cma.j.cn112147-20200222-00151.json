            "The novel coronavirus pneumonia (new coronavirus pneumonia) (NCP) has been prevalent in Wuhan and spread rapidly to all of our country. Some cases can develop into ARDS, or even death. We will share the treatment experience of severe NCP with the first-line treatment experience. The best respiratory support mode should be selected, but the timing of intubation and protection during intubation are two difficulties; patients with high level peep and poor effect in prone position can be given ECMO support. For NCP patients with mechanical ventilation, reasonable sedation and analgesia strategies should be formulated; delirium should not be ignored. In addition, there is up regulation of inflammatory factors in patients with severe NCP, but the effect of renal replacement therapy needs to be further confirmed by clinical research."
