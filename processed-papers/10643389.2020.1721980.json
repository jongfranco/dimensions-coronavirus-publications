        "abstract": "The production and application of biochar has become increasingly popular in the past 10 years. Biochar has similar characteristics to charcoal and activated charcoal: they are all pyrogenic carbonaceous matter derived from organic carbon-rich materials and produced by pyrolysis. Studies related to the incorporation of biochar in animal feed are limited. This review summarizes major studies related to the use of biochar as a feed additive for ruminants (cattle and goats), pigs, poultry (chickens and ducks) and fish. Documented positive responses to biochar supplementation include improved growth performance, blood profiles, egg yield, ability to resist pathogens including gut pathogenic bacteria and a reduction of methane production by ruminant animals. In addition, the high sorption capacity of biochar efficiently aids the removal of pollutants and toxins from animals\u2019 bodies as well as from farm environments. It is expected that there will be increasing use of biochar in animal farming. The potential use of biochar in the medical and human health sectors should also be explored.",

        "conclusion": [
            "The application of biochar as feed supplements for animal farming is built on the use of activated charcoal in treating digestive disorders in humans and animals. Biochar can be produced from a wide range of biomass and organic materials, such as wheat straw, crop residues, corn cobs, stover and wood waste. After pyrolysis, chemical or physical activation, biochar can be applied as a feed supplement. The physiochemical properties of biochar are closely connected with their sources of feedstocks and pyrolysis temperature. Feedstock with high lignin content would usually produce higher biochar yield due to the formation of char. Some feedstocks, contain specific components (e.g. Jarrah wood contains organic molecules similar to those found in wood vinegar) and thus enhance the growth and taste of livestock. If the ash content of the non-wood feedstock (e.g. biochar derived from rice plant) is high, the surface area of the biochar could be low as a result of blockage of micropores. In general, the use of biochar as a feed supplement could provide benefits to the animal husbandry industry, agriculture, and the global environment. Biochar is a promising dietary supplement for livestock, with positive effects on animal growth (weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and nutrient intake) of cattle, goats, pigs, poultry and fish. Adding biochar derived from rice husk in animal feeds could increase the weight gain of cattle, pigs, chicken. Biochar can also reduce enteric methane emissions from ruminants by providing favorable habitats for methanogenic\u2013methanotrophic microbial interactions in the gut, enhancing anaerobic methane oxidation. With similar properties to activated charcoal, with a porous structure and extensive surface area, biochar possess a high sorption ability to remove toxic substances from animal bodies, as well as from the farming environment. The sorption capability of toxicants depends on the preparation treatment of biochar and its physiochemical properties. Biochar produced from higher temperature usually illustrated higher sorption capability. The increased pyrolysis temperature also resulted in smaller biochar particles, which promoted forage digestibility and rumen fermentation kinetics. Biochar incorporated into feeds can improve poultry blood profiles and reduce pathogens through adsorption, which is a possible strategy for reducing usage of antibiotics. Undoubtedly, including biochar in animal diets appears to be an excellent strategy for animal husbandry. There are increasing biochar applications, and guideline criteria have been provided by FAO, WHO, IBI and EBF for classifying and certifying standard biochar as a feed supplement, as well as a soil amendment. This can help in regulating future utilization of biochar in animal feeds and further development of biochar for human usage."

            "The production and application of biochar has become increasingly popular in the past 10 years. Biochar has similar characteristics to charcoal and activated charcoal: they are all pyrogenic carbonaceous matter derived from organic carbon-rich materials and produced by pyrolysis. Studies related to the incorporation of biochar in animal feed are limited. This review summarizes major studies related to the use of biochar as a feed additive for ruminants (cattle and goats), pigs, poultry (chickens and ducks) and fish. Documented positive responses to biochar supplementation include improved growth performance, blood profiles, egg yield, ability to resist pathogens including gut pathogenic bacteria and a reduction of methane production by ruminant animals. In addition, the high sorption capacity of biochar efficiently aids the removal of pollutants and toxins from animals\u2019 bodies as well as from farm environments. It is expected that there will be increasing use of biochar in animal farming. The potential use of biochar in the medical and human health sectors should also be explored."

In the heating process, thermal decomposition will leave behind a microporous carbon skeleton resembling the original structure. The activation of biochar is carried out to maximize its surface area and pore density, and therefore increase its ability to capture pollutants and other particulates. The extremely high surface area of biochar, which varies from 500 to 2000 m2g\u00c01, together with its low density function as activated charcoal, has excellent adsorptive properties and is able to efficiently adsorb various substances, pollutants and gases (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLehmann_2015_a\" href=\"#rLehmann_2015_a\">Lehmann & Joseph, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTan_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rTan_et+al_2016_a\">Tan et al, 2016</a>). The physical and chemical properties of biochar, especially porosity, surface area and nutrients composition, are crucial for determining its practical applications. The physiochemical properties of biochar could mainly be determined by their sources of feedstocks and pyrolysis temperature (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJindo_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rJindo_et+al_2014_a\">Jindo, Mizumoto, Sawada, Sanchez-Monedero, & Sonoki, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKim_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rKim_et+al_2012_a\">Kim et al, 2012</a>).",

For example, the yield of biochar is dependent on the types of feedstock. Feedstock with high lignin content, which is related to the formation of char, would usually generate higher biochar yield (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSuliman_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rSuliman_et+al_2016_a\">Suliman et al, 2016</a>).

Moreover, the pH level of Jarrah wood biochar is close to the saliva of cows and thus may have the a buffering function (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJoseph_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rJoseph_et+al_2015_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJoseph_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rJoseph_et+al_2015_a\">Joseph et al, 2015</a></a>). The porosity of biochar can also be affected by the origins of feedstocks, such as the porosity of biochar derived from rice straw which was the highest, followed by apple tree branch, rice husk, and oak tree after the pyrolysis at 400 C (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJindo_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rJindo_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJindo_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rJindo_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJindo_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rJindo_et+al_2014_a\">Jindo et al, 2014</a></a></a>). The microporosity of apple tree branch and oak tree increased more rapidly than rice straw and rich husk (non-wood feedstock) when the temperature raised from 400 to 800 C. It is attributed to the relatively high ash content of rice plant materials and the access to micropores was hindered and led to a relatively lower surface area (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJindo_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rJindo_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJindo_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rJindo_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJindo_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rJindo_et+al_2014_a\">Jindo et al, 2014</a></a></a>).

Fine particle size led to higher forage digestibility and increased rumen fermentation kinetics compared with coarse biochar particles (McFarlane et al, 2017).

            "1.4.1. Biochar as feed supplements In Europe, the requirements for making biochar as a feed additive are stringent. The European Biochar Foundation (EBF) provides an outline, the European Biochar Certificate, for making feed-grade biochar that complies with the feeding purpose under the European Union Commission Regulations: (1) Commission Regulation (EC) 178/2002 and (2) Commission Regulation (EC) 834/2007 (European Biochar Foundation (EBF), 2012). These two regulations are related to the general principles and requirements of food law overseen by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), whose major concerns are food safety, regulations for organic livestock feeds, the sustainable development of organic production, labeling of organic products and repealing regulations (European Commission (EC), 2019). The European Biochar Certificate is a voluntary industry standard that differentiates between three different grades of biochar, each with its own ecological requirements and threshold values: basic, premium and feed. Basic and premium grades are intended for use in the growing of crops, whereas feed grade is intended for use as a feed additive. The ecological requirements relate to the biomass feedstocks for making biochar, and the threshold values refer to the physical and chemical properties of the biochar products (such as carbon and toxicant contents, respectively). The product criteria for feed grade biochar are more restrictive than those for basic and premium grades (European Biochar Foundation (EBF), 2012) (Table 3). The raw materials for biochar products used as feed additives should be made from 100% bio-based materials such as natural and untreated trunk wood, and the raw material composition should not vary by more than 15% (European Biochar Foundation (EBF), 2012). The criteria for gaining certification for the three different grades of biochar under this standard have been summarized below and in Table 3 (European Biochar Foundation (EBF), 2012): 1. Only the feedstocks on the \u201cpositive list\u201d (e.g. leaves, roots, bark and wood) (Supplementary material, Table S3) are allowed to be used for producing biochar.",
            "2. Feedstocks must be free of paint, solvents and other organic or nonorganic contaminants such as plastic, electronic scrap, and rubber.",
            "3. Biochar may only be produced from forest wood that was grown in Europe (appropriate standards, laws or certificates should be used to prove sustainable forest management).",
            "The raw materials used for producing biochar are biomass and organic materials. They are similar to those for producing activated charcoal. Therefore, the regulations and specification for activated charcoal published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) are also applicable for biochar (Supplementary material, Table S2). The guidelines state that carbon for producing activated charcoal can be obtained from a wide variety of sources, such as sawdust, peat, cellulose residue, coconut shells, bamboo charcoal and lignite (FAO/WHO, 2010). If the materials undergo chemical activation by alkali or acid, the chemical activating agents should be removed with water before the biochar is used as a feed additive (FAO/ WHO, 2010). Only the European Biochar Certificate program certifies biochar as an animal feed additive; only feed grade biochar is allowed to be added to animal feed in Europe. According to the guidelines (European Biochar Foundation (EBF), 2012), only biomass from untreated and natural wood is allowed as feedstock."

        "5. Conclusion": [
            "The application of biochar as feed supplements for animal farming is built on the use of activated charcoal in treating digestive disorders in humans and animals. Biochar can be produced from a wide range of biomass and organic materials, such as wheat straw, crop residues, corn cobs, stover and wood waste. After pyrolysis, chemical or physical activation, biochar can be applied as a feed supplement. The physiochemical properties of biochar are closely connected with their sources of feedstocks and pyrolysis temperature. Feedstock with high lignin content would usually produce higher biochar yield due to the formation of char. Some feedstocks, contain specific components (e.g. Jarrah wood contains organic molecules similar to those found in wood vinegar) and thus enhance the growth and taste of livestock. If the ash content of the non-wood feedstock (e.g. biochar derived from rice plant) is high, the surface area of the biochar could be low as a result of blockage of micropores. In general, the use of biochar as a feed supplement could provide benefits to the animal husbandry industry, agriculture, and the global environment. Biochar is a promising dietary supplement for livestock, with positive effects on animal growth (weight gain, feed conversion ratio, and nutrient intake) of cattle, goats, pigs, poultry and fish. Adding biochar derived from rice husk in animal feeds could increase the weight gain of cattle, pigs, chicken. Biochar can also reduce enteric methane emissions from ruminants by providing favorable habitats for methanogenic\u2013methanotrophic microbial interactions in the gut, enhancing anaerobic methane oxidation. With similar properties to activated charcoal, with a porous structure and extensive surface area, biochar possess a high sorption ability to remove toxic substances from animal bodies, as well as from the farming environment. The sorption capability of toxicants depends on the preparation treatment of biochar and its physiochemical properties. Biochar produced from higher temperature usually illustrated higher sorption capability. The increased pyrolysis temperature also resulted in smaller biochar particles, which promoted forage digestibility and rumen fermentation kinetics. Biochar incorporated into feeds can improve poultry blood profiles and reduce pathogens through adsorption, which is a possible strategy for reducing usage of antibiotics. Undoubtedly, including biochar in animal diets appears to be an excellent strategy for animal husbandry. There are increasing biochar applications, and guideline criteria have been provided by FAO, WHO, IBI and EBF for classifying and certifying standard biochar as a feed supplement, as well as a soil amendment. This can help in regulating future utilization of biochar in animal feeds and further development of biochar for human usage."

Biochar can improve soil\u2019s water holding capacity by controlling runoff water (Beck, Johnson, & Spolek, 2011) and it improves soil structure and soil properties by altering the soil biota, subsequently improving nutrient mobility and provision (Lehmann & Joseph, 2015).",

About 36% of methane emissions came from agricultural manure management (10%) and enteric fermentation in livestock such as cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats (26%) (US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2016). These ruminants gain energy from fibrous feed, relying on symbiotic relationships with bacteria, fungi and protozoa in their rumen (CastilloGonzalez et al., 2014). Microbial populations play an important role in releasing energy by digesting the fiber and producing fermentation acids. A by-product of this process is metabolic hydrogen, which should be kept at a very low levels to digest the fiber efficiently. Methanogenic archaea facilitate this digestion process within the complicated microbial ecosystem in the rumen; energy is gained for growth and multiplication after combining carbon dioxide and hydrogen to produce methane (Eger et al., 2018).",
