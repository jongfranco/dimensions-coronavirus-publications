We report here the clinical characteristics and therapeutic procedure for four patients with mild or severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. All the patients were given antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae), arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC, a traditional Chinese medicine) and other necessary support care. After treatment, three patients gained significant improvement in pneumonia associated symptoms, two of whom were confirmed 2019-nCoV negative and discharged, and one of whom was virus negative at the first test. The remaining patient with severe pneumonia had shown signs of improvement by the cutoff date for data collection. Results obtained in the current study may provide clues for treatment of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The efficacy of antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC warrants further verification in future study.",

Physical examination revealed increased respiratory rate in three patients, one of whom had tachypnea (26/min). Lung auscultation revealed rhonchi in left or right lower lobe in three patients. In all patients, there were marked abnormalities on chest radiography; involvement of both lungs was found by chest computerized tomography (CT) in 2 patients at presentation. Ground-glass opacities and consolidation were the most common radiologic www.biosciencetrends.com",

One patient (case 4) had neutrophils above the normal range, indicating the existence of concurrent bacterial infection. Lymphocytes were below the normal range in one patient (case 4) and within the normal range in other three patients. Blood gas analysis revealed that oxygen pressure was below the normal range in two patients (7.60 kPa in case 3 and 5.45 kPa in case 4) (Table 3). On the basis of the above results, two patients (case 1 and 2) were diagnosed with mild pneumonia and the other two patients (case 3 and 4) with severe pneumonia."

        "3.3. Treatment and clinical outcomes": [
            "All patients received antiviral treatment, including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae, lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg, q12h, po), arbidol (0.2 g, tid, po), and SFJDC (2.08 g, tid, po). The duration of antiviral treatment was 6-15 days. In addition, all patients were all given antibiotic treatment and started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula after admission to hospital (Table 2).",
            "Patient 1 was admitted to hospital on January 21, 2020 and thereafter received the above treatment. On January 27, routine blood analysis revealed that leucocytes and lymphocytes were increased, indicating recovery and restoration of immune function (Table 3). On January 29, chest CT demonstrated bilateral pneumonia with scattered multiple nodules, which was obviously improved compared with that obtained on January 21 (Figure 1). 2019-nCoV was twice negative in throat-swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract. The patient was free of fever, productive cough, dyspnea, short breath, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and thus discharged on January 29, 2020.",
            "Patient 2 was admitted to hospital on January 24, 2020 and then received the above mentioned treatment. On January 28, routine blood analysis showed increased count of leucocytes and lymphocytes (Table 3). Blood",
            "gas analysis revealed no obvious abnormity. On January 29, chest CT revealed unilateral pneumonia in the left lobe, which was mildly improved compared with the www.biosciencetrends.com",
            "images obtained on January 24 (Figure 2). Results of two continuous 2019-nCoV tests were negative for throat-swab specimens. Symptoms associated with pneumonia had improved and the patient was discharged on January 30, 2020.",
            "Patient 3 was admitted to hospital on January 24, 2020 and thereafter received the above mentioned treatment. The fever disappeared after one day of treatment. On January 29, chest CT showed progressed pneumonia in the right lobe (Figure 3). The treatment was continuous and the pneumonia appearance improved on February 1 as reflected by the CT image (Figure 3). On February 3, blood gas analysis demonstrated obviously increased oxygen pressure compared with that at admission. The patient had mild cough with white phlegm, and was free of fever, dyspnea, short breath, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. 2019-nCoV test result was negative for the first time on February 4, 2020. The patient remained in hospital for the second virus test.",
            "Patient 4 was admitted to hospital on January 22, 2020. In addition to the above mentioned treatments, the patient was also given human seroalbumin and \u03b3-immunoglobulin. On January 31, the patient was given an intubated ventilator-assisted breathing therapy because of refractory low blood oxygen pressure. Routine blood analysis on February 1 demonstrated the percentages of neutrophils and lymphocytes were 94% and 3.2%, respectively, which were comparable with those at admission (Table 3). Chest radiograph on this",
            "P5 day demonstrated bilateral pneumonia, which improved compared to the image obtained on January 31 (Figure 4). Chest radiograph on February 2 revealed further mild improvement. On February 3, bilateral pneumonia remained but the appearances of left lobe improved and right lobe mildly worsened. On February 5, the appearance of pneumonia improved compared with the last image (Figure 4). The patient was still using ventilators at data cutoff.",
            "We report here the clinical characteristics and therapeutic procedure for four patients with 2019CoV pneumonia receiving comprehensive therapy. The antivirus treatment regimen includes lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae), arbidol, and SFJDC. By February 4, 2020, two patients were confirmed 2019-nCoV negative and one patient was virus-negative at the first test. Lopinavir/ ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae) is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medicine used in combination with other medicines to treat adults and children over 14 days of age who are infected with HIV-1 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. It was revealed that lopinavir/ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. The combination of lopinavir and ritonavir is currently a recommended antivirus regimen in the latest version of Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by 2019-nCoV (version 5) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Arbidol is an antiviral treatment for influenza infection used in Russia and China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. It was claimed that arbidol was effective against 2019-nCoV at a concentration range of 10-30 \u03bcM in vitro [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. A randomized multicenter controlled clinical trial of arbidol in patients with 2019-nCoV (ChiCTR2000029573) has been initiated in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. SFJDC is a traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of influenza in China. This drug is also recommended for treating 2019-nCoV infection in the latest version of Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by 2019-nCoV (version 5) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "In conclusion, two mild and two severe 2019nCoV pneumonia patients were given combined Chinese and Western medicine treatment, three of whom gained significant improvement in pneumonia associated symptoms. The remaining patient with severe pneumonia has shown signs of improvement by the cutoff date for data collection. The efficacy of antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC warrants further verification in future study."
