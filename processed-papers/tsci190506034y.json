        "abstract": "Forest biomass energy material is the natural material for human survival. Wood is the main material for human development. In order to save energy, the active chemical components in wood are extracted by modern equipment and applied to biomedicine, high-grade cosmetics, precious spices and other products to promote the high attachment of wood processing industry and Value-added development. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to analyze and compare the extracts of Toonasinensis with ethanol, methanol and benzyl/ethanol in different solvents. Because of benzene ring of lignan suffered the most destruction from benzene/ethanol extractives, the FT-IR results showed that the absorbance of each peak was maximal at the benzene/ethanol extractives and minimal at the methanol extractives. In the Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) test, the ethanol extractives of Toonasinensis wood had a main retention time between 10-20 minute, which accounts for 38.44% of the total relative content; methanol extractives had a main retention time between 5-15 minute, which accounts for 41.22% of the total relative content; the benzene/ethanol extractives between 10-20 min accounted for 44.46% of the total relative content. The chemical composition and retention time of the three solvent extracts are different. The measurement and analysis of the experimental data opened up a new way for the development and utilization of woody plant energy.",
