Live attenuated vaccines are the most effective means of preventing IB and are traditionally generated by serial passaging of a wild strain in embryonated chicken eggs. In this study, the SZ isolate of the QX-like infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was continuously passaged in chicken embryos for 250 passages. We compared the pathogenicity of different passages (SZ50, SZ100, SZ150, SZ200 and SZ250) of strain SZ by clinical signs, gross lesions, viral load, tissue tropism, weight gain and tracheal ciliary activity. As the passaging increased in the chicken embryos, the strain lost its ability to infect many organs, and the viral pathogenicity gradually decreased. We also found 23 genomic variations of the QX-like strain SZ throughout the passaging process by further analyzing its complete genome sequence. This work offers valuable insight for IBV vaccine development and further research on the IBV attenuation mechanisms.",
