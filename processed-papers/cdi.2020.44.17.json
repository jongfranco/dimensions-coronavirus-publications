Data on domestic cases in this report were collected from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and state and territory case investigation reports. The Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) developed the case definition for suspected and confirmed cases, which was modified at different time points in the epidemic (Table 3). CDNA developed national guidance on investigating suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. Based on this guidance, state and territory health department investigators conducted interviews of suspected cases to collect core and enhanced data for inclusion in the NNDSS. Data was analysed using Stata to describe the epidemiology of infections in Australia and the progress of the epidemic."

            "The case fatality rate (CFR) for China has been calculated at 2.3%, based on 44,672 laboratoryconfirmed cases up to 11 February 2020. The calculated CFR was much higher in Hubei Province (2.9%) than in all other provinces (0.4%). The CFR increased with increasing age group, with the highest CFR observed among those aged 80 years or older at 14.8%. No deaths were reported in children aged less than 10 years. The CFR was calculated at 0.9% in those reporting no comorbidities and 10.5% in cases with cardiovascular disease; however, data on comorbidities was missing for 53% of confirmed cases. Cases classified as critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multi-organ failure) had a CFR of 49.0%.13 Critically ill patients who died have been shown to be older and more likely to have chronic comorbidities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] CFR estimates for regions outside mainland China are generally low; however, the clinical outcome for the majority of these cases is not yet known.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]",

Among a cohort of travellers repatriated to Germany on 1 February 2020, two travellers who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 showed no symptoms at the time of testing. On review one was found to have a faint rash and mild sore throat (pharyngitis). Both remained well and with no fever (afebrile) for seven days following isolation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] Fiftyone per cent (n = 318) of the confirmed cases on board the \u2018Diamond Princess\u2019 cruise ship as of 21 February 2020 showed no symptoms at time of specimen collection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] Information about the development of symptoms in these cases after disembarkation was not available.",
            "The exact nature of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood.

Whilst there is currently no published evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from an asymptomatic case, there is some evidence of potential infectivity of asymptomatic cases based on viral load studies. For example, the viral load detected in an asymptomatic patient, from the Chinese cohort of 17 discussed above, was similar to that in the symptomatic patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] SARS-CoV-2 was also isolated from samples in cell culture from asymptomatic German nationals.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] The role played by asymptomatic cases in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still unclear.",

Data on domestic cases in this report were collected from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and state and territory case investigation reports. The Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) developed the case definition for suspected and confirmed cases, which was modified at different time points in the epidemic (Table 3). CDNA developed national guidance on investigating suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. Based on this guidance, state and territory health department investigators conducted interviews of suspected cases to collect core and enhanced data for inclusion in the NNDSS. Data was analysed using Stata to describe the epidemiology of infections in Australia and the progress of the epidemic.",
