The Chinese Government has been taking a series of rapid, comprehensive, and effective prevention and control measures. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing. This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention and control. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency medical supplies. A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the management of public health emergencies. Based on international experiences with pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies of international concern in the future.",

            "3. Policy requirements and status of the reserve medical supplies program in China",
            "China's current reserve medical supplies program dates back to the 1970s (7). In order to ensure the effective supply of medical supplies required after disasters, epidemics, or emergencies, the State Council issued the \"Notice on Reforming and Enhancing the Management of Medical Reserves\" in 1997. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Chinese Government heavily emphasized emergency preparation and related legislation. The government issued the \"Regulations on Public Health Emergencies,\" the \"National Emergency Plan for Public Health Emergencies,\" the \"(Draft) Catalogue of health emergency personnel and equipment,\" and other documents (Table 1). Moreover, the emergency reserve supplies program clearly stipulates that \"municipal governments and county governments in areas where emergencies are likely to occur should establish a program for emergency reserve supplies, necessities, and equipment\"(8).",
            "Although policies on the emergency reserve medical supplies program have been continuously improved, they are often not fully implemented. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic shows that the Government failed to heed its responsibility for effectively \"reserving medical supplies for the prevention and control of the pandemic\" (9). In 2010, all of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the provincial level were evaluated for their capacity to respond to public health emergencies, and the results indicated that the readiness of emergency reserve supplies was only 37.5%, only 4.8% of all centers met standards, and the types and quantities of supplies were far from adequate (10). The first reason for this is because the mechanism for funding reserve medical supplies still has flaws; it lacks long-term and sustainable input (11). Second, a mechanism for managing emergency reserve supplies has yet to be created; there is a lack of integrated planning, timely storage, or rapid distribution. Third, the risks of an emergency and response capabilities vary with the level of economic and social development, necessitating the continuous updating of lists of emergency supplies. Since the issuance of the \"(Draft) Catalogue of health emergency personnel and equipment\" in 2008, however, no adjustments or updates have been made, resulting in substantial inability to meet current standards (12)."
        ],
        "4. Main systems of reserve medical supplies around the world": [
            "With the frequent occurrence of public health emergencies across the world, some countries have established relatively mature medical stockpile systems to protect their populations from potential public health emergencies (13). In 2003, the United States created the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) Program to maintain a stockpile of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency. The SNS represents a real material asset in federal warehouses that can be quickly activated to meet the country's needs, enhancing the country's ability to respond effectively to public health emergencies. There are mainly three categories of SNS including 12-hour push packages, vendor managed inventory (VMI), and stockpile managed inventory (SMI). 12-hour push packages can be delivered to the collection reserve within 12 h of an emergency, and each emergency package contains sufficient medicines and medical supplies for hundreds of thousands of individuals to sustain treatment and prevention for several days. Vendor managed inventory (VMI) is managed inventory maintained by specific vendors or manufacturers that is stored at the supplier in the form of signed contracts and that can be delivered within 24 to 36 hours upon approval. Stockpile managed inventory (SMI) is directly managed and reserved by the SNS and includes physical reserves and ordered reserves. The US also has other forms of emergency supplies, such as chemical kits and family medical kits. In the event of an emergency, the SNS Program will deploy a team of advisors to coordinate and assist state and local authorities in receiving, managing, distributing, and recovering emergency medical supplies. The stockpile service advance group (SSAG) and technical advisory response unit (TARU) consist of experts in public health, emergency response, and logistics. In response to public health emergencies, Canada and Australia have also established the National Strategic Stockpile (NESS) (14) and National Medical Stockpile (NMS) (15) systems; these systems provide key reserves of essential medicines and equipment, such as personal protective equipment, antibiotics, and antivirals. The NESS and NMS are maintained in various strategic locations by federally leasing warehouses and by other means (Table 2).",
            "5. How to enhance the reserve medical supplies system to deal with public health emergencies",
            "Emerging pandemic have been increasing around the world over the past few years, and more than 40 emerging infectious diseases have been detected, such as SARS, H7N9 avian influenza, Ebola virus, and MERS.
