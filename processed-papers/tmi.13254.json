            "Significant efforts are needed to increase ART coverage among HIVpositive Men who have Sex with Men with high CD4 counts in China. Although prevalence of missing ART doses is low, non-compliance with dosing schedules or instructions should not be neglected. 308\u2013318",
            "Gene transcript analysis revealed significant up-regulation of Collagen type III vs. Collagen type I in fibrotic skin biopsies of limb nodules from lymphoedema patients. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis also revealed enhancement of Collagen types I and III in fibrotic vs. normal skin. These preliminary findings indicate the potentially significant involvement of Collagen type III in grade-3 lymphoedema patients\u2019 development of fibrotic skin. 319\u2013327",
            "In Ethiopia, improving community awareness of antenatal care, employing female health professionals and culturally adapted guidelines could improve skilled delivery utilization. In a patriarchal society, involving male partners in all maternal health issues is essential to increase use of maternal health services and to decrease maternal mortality. 328\u2013337",
            "The tuberculosis epidemic in Brazil is determined by access to health services, especially the provision of HIV testing among those diagnosed with tuberculosis, accelerated urbanization with large pockets of poverty, and unsanitary housing conditions, corroborating global trends. 338\u2013345",
            "A longitudinal, retrospective study of the TB program in Lima, Peru reveals partial compliance with TB contact investigation and identifies factors related to contact persons, index cases and health facilities that affect the start and completion of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy. These can guide the TB program in increasing its coverage and quality. 346\u2013356",
            "Neglecting the impact of diagnostic performance may lead to BIAS in RCTs. Evidence standards for diagnostic methods and drugs should be comparable. Diagnostic methods should be characterized in the study protocol. 357\u2013363",
            "For treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis, sulfadiazine suspension (100 mg/mL\u00c01) in simple syrup may be the most suitable formulation because it remains stable for 14 days at room temperature, providing an alternative liquid dosage form for children. 364\u2013372",
            "In China, the proportion of tuberculosis patients with unfavourable treatment outcomes increases with smear-negative pulmonary TB, extrapulmonary TB and diabetes mellitus. TB programmes need to ensure early detection of diabetes and intensive patient support to those at risk. 373\u2013379",
