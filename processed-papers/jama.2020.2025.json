            "Under the rule, CDC agents can initially apprehend persons suspected or known to be infected with specified communicable diseases for up to 72 hours. Medical testing, consensual treatment, modes of communication, and other accommodations must be offered at the government\u2019s expense (unless health insurers are obligated to pay).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]",
            "Following initial apprehension, the CDC can quarantine suspected cases or isolate infected persons pursuant to due process protections, including access to independent medical experts, legal counsel, and outside witnesses. CDC agents must also determine whether less-restrictive alternatives to separation and confinement are available. Although meaningful, these due process measures are constitutionally insufficient. The Supreme Court requires \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence (not reasonable beliefs) for civil confinements, with the right to appeal to independent tribunals.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Under the CDC\u2019s rule, individual appeals are handled through internal agency reviews although anyone deprived of liberty has the right to petition courts for habeas corpus.",
            "Evaluating Compulsory Powers Compulsory public health powers should be evaluated and justified under a common legal and ethical standard, including (1) individuals must pose a significant risk of spreading a dangerous, infectious disease; (2) interventions must be likely to ameliorate risks; (3) least-restrictive means necessary to achieve public health objectives are required; (4) use of coercion should be proportionate to the risk; and (5) assessments must be based on the best available scientific evidence. In emerging crises when the science is uncertain, adoption of the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d is reasonable to ensure public safety. Yet, health emergencies do not warrant coercion that is indiscriminate, overbroad, excessive, or without evidentiary support.",
            "Entry bans of non-US nationals are overbroad because there is no individualized risk assessment. Enhanced screening, monitoring, and social distancing are less-restrictive means to achieve the public health objective. The World Health Organization officially recommends against widespread travel restrictions under the International Health Regulations, including the US entry ban.",
            "Quarantines of evacuees or other passengers arriving from Hubei province may be justified under the precautionary principle. Hubei is currently a \u201chot zone\u201d of contagion where individuals have significant risks of exposure. The quarantine period also is justified by epidemiologic data placing the outer limit of asymptomatic transmission at 14 days.",
            "Quarantines of passengers arriving from mainland China appear excessive and are inconsistent with available epidemiologic data. While there are mounting cases outside Hubei, most passengers from mainland China have not been exposed to infection, suggesting that quarantines are overinclusive. Less-restrictive alternatives, such as enhanced screening and active monitoring, could ameliorate risks to the US population.",
            "Self-monitoring and home quarantines are effective public health tools. During prior infectious disease emergencies, states have ordered exposed individuals to remain in their personal residences and self-monitor for early signs of infection. Thousands of US residents who have returned from China are already sheltering at home. When rigorously implemented (including regular checkins, health care worker visits, and social support), home quarantine orders are lawful, effective, and more respectful of individual rights to liberty and privacy than restrictive, off-site measures.",
            "This is a critical juncture in the COVID-19 epidemic, when community transmission can be prevented. Affording public health departments with the resources needed to implement evidencebased strategies is essential. A sound response starts with science, voluntarism, and civic responsibility. Coercive measures could be counterproductive and erode public trust and cooperation. Effective public health interventions that delay the spread of COVID-19 would allow time to develop key biomedical technologies, possibly including vaccines."
