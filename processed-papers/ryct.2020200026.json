At admission, her body temperature was elevated to 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F) and coarse breath sounds were heard during auscultation. Laboratory studies showed leucopenia, and positive sputum analysis using real-time reverse transcriptase fluorescence polymerase chain reaction confirmed infection by COVID-19 (formerly known as 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].
