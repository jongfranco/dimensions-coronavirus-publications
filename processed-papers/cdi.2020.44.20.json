Data on domestic cases in this report were collected from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance health.gov.au/cdi<br/><br/>System (NNDSS) and state and territory health department media releases. The Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) developed the case definition for suspected and confirmed cases, which was modified at different time points in the epidemic (Table 3). Based on this guidance, state and territory health department investigators conducted interviews of suspected cases to collect core and enhanced data for inclusion in the NNDSS. Data was analysed using Stata to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Australia and the progress of the epidemic."

Analysis of the genetic diversity of these samples found few mutations, suggesting that following initial animal-to-human transmission from a single source, spread has resulted from human-to-human transmission over a limited period of time. Based on modelling, researchers estimate that initial human infection was in November to early December 2019. Groups of sequences with the same mutations are being identified, confirming humanto-human transmission and linking cases across countries.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] Ongoing surveillance of sequences and shared mutations will assist with understanding of the global spread of the virus."

The Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) developed the case definition for suspected and confirmed cases, which was modified at different time points in the epidemic (Table 3). Based on this guidance, state and territory health department investigators conducted interviews of suspected cases to collect core and enhanced data for inclusion in the NNDSS. Data was analysed using Stata to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Australia and the progress of the epidemic.",
