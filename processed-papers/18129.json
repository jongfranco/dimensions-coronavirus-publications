In this study, we present the finding of serial computed tomography in a female patient with 2019-nCoV. Case presentation: We report a 40-year-old female who presented with the symptoms of fever, chest tightness, and fatigue. She was further diagnosed with 2019-nCoV confirmed by rRT-PCR. In terms of her chest CT findings, patchy consolidation shadows, and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) rapidly progressed in both lungs, peripherally. After treatment, the previous lesions were almost absorbed, leaving the fibrous lesions.",
