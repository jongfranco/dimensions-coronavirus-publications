        "abstract": "The measurement of deposited aerosol particles in the respiratory tract via in vivo and in vitro approaches is difficult due to those approaches\u2019 many limitations. In order to overcome these obstacles, different computational models have been developed to predict the deposition of aerosol particles inside the lung. Recently, some remarkable models have been developed based on conventional semi-empirical models, one-dimensional whole-lung models, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics models, and artificial neural networks for the prediction of aerosol-particle deposition with a high accuracy relative to experimental data. However, these models still have some disadvantages that should be overcome shortly. In this paper, we take a closer look at the current research trends as well as the future directions of this research area.",

However, most CFD models can predict the deposition of aerosol particles only in the oronasal and the upper RT. The major limitation of CFD-based models that prevents their full application is the requirement of high computational resources. Besides conventional models, which have been frequently used to simulate aerosol-particle deposition in the lungs, some reported ones use the advantages of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, the major limitation of these models is their requirement of big data from experiments for model development and training. The advantages and disadvantages of the mentioned models, with some recent updates, are briefly summarized below (Table 2).",

            "The lung is an organ that is continuously exposed to environmental agents [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. As such, it can be negatively affected by toxic agents that are prevalent in the atmosphere [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Millions of people around the world suffer from related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].<br/><br/>An aerosol is solid or particulate matter suspension in air. Aerosols are derived from nature (volcanos, dust storms, and forest fires) or human activities (cooking and fuel-burning) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Particulate matter (PM) is one of the major pollutants that has harmful effects on human health [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), to take one example, has classified PM as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1, IARC) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Pope and Dockery (2006) indicated that an increase of PM2.5 of around 10 \u03bcg/m3 could lead to a 1% mortality increase [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. According to the WHO (2013), daily mortality is expected to increase to about 0.2%\u20130.6% per 10 \u03bcg/m3 of PM10, while the exposure of PM2.5 could lead to an increase of cardiopulmonary mortality by 6%\u201313% per 10 \u03bcg/m3. According to the European air quality standards for PM concentrations (Directives 1999/30/EC and 2008/50/EC; EC: European Commission), the annual limit values are 25 \u03bcg/m3 for PM2.5 and 40 \u03bcg/m3 for PM10. The 24-h limit for PM is set as 50 \u03bcg/m3 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].

            "The Exposure Dose Model (ExDoM) was extended from ICRP66 to study both particle exposure and dose for different size distributions. According to the experimental data, the ExDoM can calculate the particle-size characteristics, the deposition fraction, and the particle dose in the RT regions. It can also estimate the clearance, the retention (in the RT, GI tract, lymph nodes), and the absorption of aerosol particles into blood capillaries during and after exposure. The workflow and input/output data for the model are shown in Figure 5. In the ExDoM, the aerosol size distribution, the individual dose rate, the clearance of deposited particles, and the particle mass in each region of the lung during and after particle exposure and their transfer to the GI tract, lymph nodes, and blood can be calculated by Equations (1)\u2013(4) in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Atmosphere 2019, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW Atmosphere 2020, 11, 137",
            "The Exposure Dose Model 2 (ExDoM2) was developed from the ExDoM with a physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model also by Chalvalzaki et al (2015) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. PBPK has been used to examine metal (As, Pb, Cd, Cr, and Mn) distributions from the blood circulation system to different organs such as the kidneys, heart, brain, muscle, and bone [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>].<br/><br/>The PBPK model also can be used to estimate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and clearance of chemicals that are inhaled into the body. Different equations in the PBPK model quantitatively represent actual physiological processes to simulate the behavior of compounds in the body [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. They can also be specifically used for prediction of the behavior of As, Pb, Cd, Cr, and Mn in RT [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. The PBPK model\u2019s structures for As, Pb, Cd, and Mn are presented in Figure S4. The fate of these elements was estimated with Equations (5) and (6), as shown in the Supplementary Information [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>].",
            "The multiple-path model was created by the Center for Health Research (currently the Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, USA). This model closely matches reality due to its application of actual airways measurements and the asymmetry of lung morphology. The theory behind the MPPD model can be found in a study by Anjilvel and Asgharian (1995) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. The deposited concentration in each airway is calculated as a function of time for the proximal and distal ends. If one knows the particle concentration at the proximal end of an airway, the particle concentration at its distal end can be calculated for different deposition mechanisms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].<br/><br/>5.2.2. Applications",
            "The stochastic nature of the lung means that the differences in morphometric, physiologic, and histologic parameters can lead to dose differences at the cellular level. These parameters can be solved by a stochastic model in which they are randomly selected via Monte Carlo methods based on their probability distributions. Inhaled particles are passed through this stochastic airway structure via the random selection of airway sequences for each particle until the occurrence of deposition. A fully stochastic deposition model (IDEAL) was developed and introduced by Koblinger, Hofmann et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>]. This model could be used to calculate the total, regional, and generation-by-generation deposition of inhaled particles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].<br/><br/>5.3.2. Applications",
            "The realistic simulation of lung-aerosol dynamics can provide important information on how toxic particles can be deposited and related to the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, COPD, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pulmonary fibrosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. However, due to the limitations of current computational resources, it is challenging to simulate the transportation of aerosol dynamics in all generations of the human respiratory tract. Thus, it is necessary to simplify lung configurations to adapt to specific modeling requirements [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. There are different simplified lung configurations in the literature, such as the earlier-noted semi-empirical models (such as the ICRP model), the trumpet model, the multiple-path model, and the stochastic multi-path lung model. These models are popular due to their ease of use and low computational resource requirement [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>]. However, due to their simple inlet conditions and semi-analytical correlations for mechanisms of deposition, the accuracies of these computed deposition models are still questionable [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>].",

            "There are many computational models in the literature. The most common ones are semi-empirical models, 1D whole-lung models, and 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. While semi-empirical models can predict the total lung-deposited concentration with acceptable accuracy, they are limited in the prediction of the regional deposition of aerosol particles. On the other hand, while 1D whole-lung models can also predict aerosol deposition in the entire lung, they cannot cover all aerosol deposition mechanisms, and they neglect the complexity of geometry and various other factors that influence particle deposition. Other remarkable models in the literature are CFD models, which have many benefits compared to semi-empirical and 1D whole-lung models due to their use of realistic lung geometry and particle transport equations. However, most CFD models can predict the deposition of aerosol particles only in the oronasal and the upper RT. The major limitation of CFD-based models that prevents their full application is the requirement of high computational resources. Besides conventional models, which have been frequently used to simulate aerosol-particle deposition in the lungs, some reported ones use the advantages of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, the major limitation of these models is their requirement of big data from experiments for model development and training. The advantages and disadvantages of the mentioned models, with some recent updates, are briefly summarized below (Table 2)."

As such, it can be negatively affected by toxic agents that are prevalent in the atmosphere [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Millions of people around the world suffer from related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
            "An aerosol is solid or particulate matter suspension in air. Aerosols are derived from nature (volcanos, dust storms, and forest fires) or human activities (cooking and fuel-burning) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Particulate matter (PM) is one of the major pollutants that has harmful effects on human health [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), to take one example, has classified PM as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1, IARC) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Pope and Dockery (2006) indicated that an increase of PM2.5 of around 10 \u03bcg/m3 could lead to a 1% mortality increase [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. According to the WHO (2013), daily mortality is expected to increase to about 0.2%\u20130.6% per 10 \u03bcg/m3 of PM10, while the exposure of PM2.5 could lead to an increase of cardiopulmonary mortality by 6%\u201313% per 10 \u03bcg/m3. According to the European air quality standards for PM concentrations (Directives 1999/30/EC and 2008/50/EC; EC: European Commission), the annual limit values are 25 \u03bcg/m3 for PM2.5 and 40 \u03bcg/m3 for PM10. The 24-h limit for PM is set as 50 \u03bcg/m3 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].

For example, Guha et al (2014) modified the ICRP model to investigate the effects of pathogenic bioaerosols such as botulinum toxin (BTX), influenza virus, and Bacillus anthracis on human health [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. There are some differences between their model and the original one: 1) The modified ICRP model could automatically calculate the shape factor of nonspherical particles, 2) it could implement the normal size distributions of the purified monomers of bioaerosols, and 3) it could convert the lung deposition estimation from a function of age to a function of height due to the relations between these two factors. The differences between the modified ICRP and the original ICRP and Lung Dose Evaluation Program (LUDEP) model can be seen in Figure S3. According to that data, for adults, the order of toxicological effects was BTX > influenza virus > B. anthracis, whereas the order for infants was BTX > B. anthracis > influenza virus. Due to infants\u2019 lower breathing flow rates, the doses of most biological matter in the ET, TB, and AL regions, as well as the total dose, were lower for them than for adults. However, the deposition per unit surface area was higher for infants, due to their smaller lung and lung area.

In Finokalia, the fine-particle concentration was 8.6\u201320.1 \u03bcg/m3, whereas that for coarse particles was 8.0\u201320.9 \u03bcg/m3. By using the ExDoM for an adult Caucasian male, the cumulative daily dose was estimated to be from 345 to 761 \u03bcg total particles. The fine- and coarse-particle doses were associated with their relative concentrations on each observation day. The results indicated that ~50% of the exposed particulate mass was finally delivered and deposited into the RT surfaces. In general, most fine particles are absorbed in the blood, while most of coarse particles are delivered to the trachea region by the mucociliary escalator and then swallowed. Particle retention is determined by the particles\u2019 delivered dose and size distribution, especially in areas such as the bronchiolar (bb), airway walls, and the AL region. A total of 3286 of the 4873 \u03bcg particles deposited to the RT (except for ET1) were transferred to the GI tract (~67.4%), and 375 \u03bcg (~7.7%) continued to the blood. About 24.9% of the deposited particles remained in the RT (mainly in the alveolar-interstitial (AI region) at the end of the exposure. In Oslo, the average PM10 concentration ranged from 4 to 20 \u03bcg/m3 per hour, the exposure concentration ranged from 7.60 to 12.37 \u03bcg/m3 per hour, and the cumulative dose ranged from 133 to 212 \u03bcg/m3 per day. A total of 56 of the 197 \u03bcg of particles deposited to the RT (except for ET1) were transferred to the GI tract (~29%), and 139 \u03bcg continued to the blood (~71%). Approximately 0.2% of the deposited particles remained in the RT at the end of the exposure. The mean of fine-particle diameter was 0.15~0.35 \u03bcm, whereas for the coarse mode, it was more significant, with values varying from 1.15 to 3.89 \u03bcm. It was found that the fine-particle dose was higher in the AL region, whereas the coarse-particle dose was deposited mainly in the ET region. The elemental and organic carbon (EC and OC, respectively) were collected mostly in the ET region at doses four times larger than the inorganic ion dose [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>].",

They found that, although the PM2.5 level inside the train was lower than those on the station platforms, the highest dose was found inside the trains due to the longer duration of exposure. Therefore, the particle dose was determined to be closely related to the exposure period. During a commute by subway, ~80% of the inhaled subway PM2.5 mass was deposited in the RT. PM2.5 particles were deposited mostly in the ET region (68%), followed by the AL region (4%).

The results showed that PMPb was accumulated mainly in the bone (2.29 \u00d7 10\u22121 \u03bcg), blood (7.50 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcg), and muscle (4.84 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcg); PMCd was mainly accumulated in the lungs (2.68 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03bcg) and intestines (4.75 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03bcg); PMMn was mainly accumulated in the lungs (8.72 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcg) and other tissues (1.17 \u00d7 10\u22121 \u03bcg); and PMCr was mainly accumulated in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (9.17 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcg) and lungs (5.29 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u03bcg) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. For PM8.8, 158 \u03bcg was deposited to the RT, 72 \u03bcg to the ET1 region, and 86 \u03bcg to the ET2, trachea, bronchi (BB), bb, and AL. Of the PM8.8 deposited in the ET1, 13 \u03bcg was cleared by nose blowing, while 31 \u03bcg was transferred to the ET2 region. Therefore, the PM8.8 deposition concentration in the ET2 was increased to 117 \u03bcg. Of this 117 \u03bcg, 73 \u03bcg (~62%) was transferred to the esophagus, while 7 \u03bcg (~6%) was absorbed into the blood. At the end of the exposure, ~32% of the particles deposited in the four regions of the RT (ET2, BB, bb, and AL) remained [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. Chalvatzaki and Lazaridis (2015) compared these results from the ExDoM2 with the original ExDoM. In the ExDoM, of the 109 \u03bcg that was deposited in ET2, ~57% of particles that were deposited in the four regions of the RT were transferred to the GI tract, ~7% were transferred to the blood, and ~36% remained after the exposure time. The differences between the ExDoM and the ExDoM2 arose from the differences in the clearance rates from the respective compartments of the lung, the default adsorption parameters, and the changes in the treatment of ET due to the transfer from ET1 to ET2 and, therefore, the higher systemic uptake in the GI tract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>].",

The results showed that the deposited dose in the RT was the highest for Lisbon, which also had the highest PM concentration among the three cities. They also found that the activity profile and individual physical characteristics of the subject had strong influences on the predicted deposited dose.

However, they also found that, if coarse particles have a low density, they also can be deposited in the pulmonary area. Additionally, they found some differences between the deposition of soil-dust particles and traffic particles.

Additionally, because the lumped \u201ctrumpet\u201d model was used, they could not consider the heterogeneity of the lung\u2019s structure.

These parameters can be solved by a stochastic model in which they are randomly selected via Monte Carlo methods based on their probability distributions. Inhaled particles are passed through this stochastic airway structure via the random selection of airway sequences for each particle until the occurrence of deposition. A fully stochastic deposition model (IDEAL) was developed and introduced by Koblinger, Hofmann et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>].

Sturm (2016) studied the deposition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the human lung by using the stochastic model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>]. The deposition mechanism of CNTs inside the lung is shown in Figure S7. The fluid-dynamic characteristics of the particles were simulated by the implementation of a rigid fiber model that accounted for diverse forces and torques acting on the particles during their translocation within the inhalation process. The deposition of CNTs in the entire RT was estimated via the application of the aerodynamic/thermodynamic diameters concepts as well as related empirical deposition formulae. According to the results, CNT deposition depends on their size and conditions. It was found that particles of ~1 nm diameter were deposited mainly in the AT airway, whereas particles of ~10 nm size were deposited primarily in the alveoli. CNTs of large size (~100 nm) seem not to be deposited in the RT [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>].",

He found that most PM was deposited in the ET and upper bronchi regions for infants and children, while for adolescents and adults, PM was deposited mainly in lower regions such as the lower bronchi and alveoli. He also found that even though mucus viscosities are lower in young subjects, the clearance rate is faster in small lungs because of the shorter clearance paths. However, PM is still considered to be a hazardous material for young subjects due to the fact that the particle concentrations per area of lung tissue can reach alarming values within a short inhalation period [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c68\" href=\"#r68\">68</a>]."

However, due to the limitations of current computational resources, it is challenging to simulate the transportation of aerosol dynamics in all generations of the human respiratory tract. Thus, it is necessary to simplify lung configurations to adapt to specific modeling requirements [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. There are different simplified lung configurations in the literature, such as the earlier-noted semi-empirical models (such as the ICRP model), the trumpet model, the multiple-path model, and the stochastic multi-path lung model. These models are popular due to their ease of use and low computational resource requirement [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>]. However, due to their simple inlet conditions and semi-analytical correlations for mechanisms of deposition, the accuracies of these computed deposition models are still questionable [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>].",

Morphological variations of airway geometry, including axial and lateral airway surface, can be accounted for in a CFD model.

In CFD models, factors such as transient flow, turbulence, and turbulent particle dispersion, hygroscopic particle-size change, and fluid\u2013wall interactions in complex geometries can be directly accounted for in simulations. With the employment of realistic geometries, the deposition of aerosol particles in complex structures such as the larynx, bifurcations, and constricted airways can be predicted.

            "Other methods, such as large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulation (DNS), could also be used. DNS can numerically solve the Navier\u2013Stokes equation for all significant spatial and temporal scales, while they do not require any additional turbulence modeling. However, the computational cost increases with Reynolds number as Re3 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>].",
            "On the other hand, LES requires the explicit representation of large-scale turbulent eddies, including anisotropic energy, while more isotropic turbulent motions are modeled in the smaller case. This method is far less computationally expensive than the DNS method, but it is still higher than RANS. Compared to these methods, RANS is still the most popular due to its lesser computer demands [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c76\" href=\"#r76\">76</a>]. However, because RANS was mainly developed for turbulent flows, it is the least accurate method when applied to complex structures such as the human lung. Even for upper human airways, where the flow is mainly turbulent, Zang and Kleinstreuer (2011) showed that the RANS method, when using the standard k-\u03c9 turbulent model, could not compete with the LES computational method in general. However, the results from the low-Reynolds number (LRN) k-\u03c9 and the shear-stress transport (SST) are similar to those of the LES method [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>]. Though LES and DNS are more computationally expensive than RANS, the time for the simulation of aerosol deposition by LES and DNS could be reduced due to the availability of high-performance computing [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>].",

        "6.2. Applications": [
            "In contrast with comparisons of prediction data from CFD models with in vitro data, comparisons of prediction data from CFD models with in vivo data for pharmaceutical aerosols are still rare [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>]. Kleinstreuer et al (2007) and Vinchurkar et al (2012) compared the predictions of MT deposition and lung delivery by CFD models with in vivo data sets for metered dose inhalers (MDIs). However, these models are usable only for the MT region and upper TB airways [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>]. Tian et al (2015) compared the CFD prediction results with in vivo data for pharmaceutical aerosol deposition [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. The CFD model includes a dry powder inhaler (DPI), a soft mist inhaler (SMI), a characteristics model for the MT region and upper TB airways, stochastic individual pathways (SIPs) for the remaining TB regions, and CFD-based models to estimate the deposition of pharmaceutical aerosols in the AL region. For generations are turbulent flows were expected, the LRN k-\u03c9 model has been used for simulation due to its high accuracy in the prediction of pressure drop, velocity profiles and shear stress for transitional and turbulent flows. In lower generations where turbulence does not occur, laminar simulations have been applied. For particle transport, the Lagrangian tracking method has been applied. The random walk model has been used to model the effect of turbulent fluctuations on the trajectories of aerosol particles. The anisotropic turbulence correction has been used to improve the simulation of turbulent effects on particles. In order to improve the accuracy of the prediction of particle deposition in the turbulent flow fields, the near-wall interpolation has been included. The predicted total lung deposition for the monodisperse aerosol of 1\u20137 \u03bcm size has been found to be close to the in vivo data, with a relative error of 6%. For the MT region, specifically the central airways (bifurcations B1\u2013B7), and airways from B8 through the alveoli, the CFD predictions have been found to have a <10% average relative error for both the DPI and SMI inhalers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>].",
            "Longest et al (2016) validated the use of whole-airway CFD with in vivo data to predict the deposition of DPI aerosols at multiple flow rates [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>]. This approach is flexible enough to directly involve aerosol physics for the development of new drug delivery and inhaler strategies. A Novolizer DPI with a budesonide formulation was chosen based on the two-dimensional (2D) gamma scintigraphy data available for humans and three different inhalation waveforms. To characterize the particle-size distribution (PSD), in vitro cascade impaction experiments were initially conducted at multiple constant (square-wave) particle-size flow rates. At the point that aerosols were formed in the inhaler, a CFD model was applied to determine the PSDs. The whole-lung airway geometries were characterized by combining CFD with SIPs. For each inhalation waveform, the PSD was determined based on a constant particle-size flow rate that was equal to the average peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR) and mean flow rate (AVG (PIFR, Mean)). After applying this technique, the prediction results agreed with the in vivo data, with <15% acceptable differences across the three different regions for all of the inhalation waveforms. Large flow-rate-dependent differences were found via defining the ratio between peripheral and central deposition (P/C) based on the AL and TB compartments, which were not indicated in the original 2D in vivo data. The agreement between the estimation from the CFD and in vivo data was dependent on the accuracy of the PSD initial estimation; thus, the combination of the in vitro and in silico approaches was emphasized. Besides, the AVG (PIFR, Mean) value was proven as a potential method for the characterization of DPI aerosols at a constant flow rate. The approach from Longest et al (2016) remains disadvantageous given the complexity of the underlying physics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>].",
            "Augusto et al (2016) applied the CFD model to evaluate the effects of physical mechanisms, particle size, and breathing conditions on particulate deposition in a triple-bifurcation airway [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. In their study, four breathing conditions, including sleep, resting, moderate, and intense activity, were employed with particle diameters ranging from 1 to 10 \u03bcm. A 3D triple-bifurcation model (four generations) was applied for the simulation. In the results, the deposition of aerosol particles in each of the three bifurcations was not uniform and was dependent on particle diameter. The effects of the gravitational settling and Brownian diffusion mechanisms on particle deposition were also evaluated. In the results, the pathways of the larger particles were strongly influenced by gravitational settling, especially when for low velocity. With a particle diameter of 10 \u03bcm, the difference between the simulations with and without gravity could reach ~172%. Brownian diffusion also influenced the deposition of particles when the velocity was lower, but this mechanism was more significant for the particles of smaller size. However, this effect was small, showing a maximum value of 11% for particles of 1 \u03bcm diameter. Additionally, the increase in air-flow velocity and particle size were able to affect the deposition pattern. For example, for sleep and resting activities, particles of <6 \u03bcm diameter were mostly deposited in the first bifurcation, whereas larger particles were mostly deposited in the third bifurcation. For the moderate and intense conditions, inhaled particles were deposited predominantly in the first bifurcation for all of the particle diameters that were accounted for in the study. The authors also concluded that the particle deposition in the human RT was significantly higher with more vigorous activity, such as exercise [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Lintermann et al (2017) used the one-way coupled Euler\u2013Lagrange approach for the flow in the lung to investigate the deposition of particles in the upper human tracheobronchial tract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>]. The lattice-Boltzmann method was used to stimulate the flows, while a practical solver was used to tract the aerosol. They found that 32% of more massive and large particles with a diameter of 100 \u03bcm were deposited in the deep airways of the lung, and a particle mixture of 2.5\u201310 \u03bcm was deposited in the primary, lobar, and segmental bronchi. The deposition of particulate matters below the sixth generation and could lead to bronchi damage [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>].",
            "In order to reduce simulation time, high-performance computers can be used. Calmet et al (2019) recently applied LES coupled with a Lagrangian method to model the transport of aerosol medicine during exhalation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>]. They found that deposition increased with the exercise breathing condition. In their study, a MareNostrum supercomputer (Barcelona Supercomputing Center) was used for the simulation. In order to carry out the simulation, 110,000 time-steps were required on 480 cores that required ~20 hours, and 20,000\u201330,000 mesh elements were used on each core to maintain a good parallel efficiency [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>]. Calmet et al (2016) conducted the large-scale CFD stimulation of the transitional and turbulent flow by using two supercomputers to solve the transient Navier\u2013Strokes equation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>]. The lung geometry in the study composed of an exterior face and the airways from the nasal cavity to the third lung bifurcation. They found that the complex flows were produced from the transient flow over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. From their study, it was found that the turbulent level is higher in the throat than in the nose [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>].",
            "Aerosol deposition, as predicted through CFD approaches, remains challenging and should be further simplified [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>]. There have been some efforts to reduce the complexity of CFD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>]. One strategy is the combination of CFD models with other techniques. Kolanjiyil and Kleinstreuer (2016) introduced a new whole-lung-airway model (WLAM) that tries to represent the actual lung geometry by combining a basic 3D configuration from mouth to trachea, subsequently lumping the remaining airways together as a 1D conduit [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>]. In their models, the shear stress transport (SST) k-\u03c9 is used to stimulate the laminar, transitional, and fully turbulent flow regimes, while the Lagrangian method is used for particle transport. The WLAM could simplify the modeling strategy for the geometry of bifurcating airways as well as the related fluid-particle dynamics. In WLAM model, a wall-displacement boundary condition is applied for the fluid-particle dynamics in the AL region. Such models to track the trajectories of transient particles from the inhalation point to either deposition or exhalation during multiple breathing cycles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",
            "WLAM can simulate different breathing conditions (Figure S8) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>]. The results from the steady-state simulation of the airways of the oral\u2013tracheobronchial region have shown that the estimated effects are similar to the experimental data. The WLAM can capture the airflow and behavior of transient particles under realistic breathing conditions and provide both total and regional particle deposition results with a high accuracy relative to experimental data (Figure S9). The authors also expected that drugs of 10 \u03bcm size were mainly deposited in the upper TB, while drugs of 5 \u03bcm size were mainly deposited in the AL region [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>].",
            "Kolanjiyil et al (2017) continued to apply the WLAM to understand the efficacy of drug-aerosols that are injected by using DPI [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. Their total and regional particle deposition results returned by the WLAM were similar to the experimental data in the literature. By using curcumin aerosols as target drugs, they found that the current DPI could deposit ~50% of drugs in the oral cavity. They also highlighted the difference between curcumin drugs in their polydisperse and monodisperse forms. The percentage of polydisperse curcumin drugs that were deposited in the oral cavity was higher than that of monodisperse curcumin drugs due to the larger particle size [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>].",
            "However, the WLAM still has some limitations. One is that the model can estimate the inhomogeneity of regional deposition only in the extra-thoracic airways, whereas, for the remaining airways, it segmentally averages the deposited particle concentrations. Another limitation is that it does not yet account for subject-specific lung morphology. Furthermore, the asymmetrical nature of human lung airways is not yet covered either. However, the current WLAM can be combined with different lung data for subject-specific purposes. Additionally, the WLAM can estimate the deposition of aerosol particles of > 400 nm size. For nano drugs of < 100 nm diameter, additional models such as Brownian diffusion are required. Kolanjiyil et al (2016) claimed that it is possible to upgrade the current WLAM with more realistic upper TB airways because particle transport is influenced mainly by the asymmetrical flow structures in this region [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>]. Therefore, the updated model can increase the accuracy of the current model, but this would come at the cost of more computational time and resources [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>]."

The optimized ANN model had a 9-4-1 architecture and average R2 values of 0.9 \u00b1 0.02 that reflected the importance and interdependency of active pharmaceutical ingredients, formulations, and device inputs in the performance of dry powder inhalers. However, although the Taguchi method is useful for the optimization of ANN architectures, it requires more massive datasets and more variable inputs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c103\" href=\"#r103\">103</a>]."

        "8. Conclusios": [
            "There are many computational models in the literature. The most common ones are semi-empirical models, 1D whole-lung models, and 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. While semi-empirical models can predict the total lung-deposited concentration with acceptable accuracy, they are limited in the prediction of the regional deposition of aerosol particles. On the other hand, while 1D whole-lung models can also predict aerosol deposition in the entire lung, they cannot cover all aerosol deposition mechanisms, and they neglect the complexity of geometry and various other factors that influence particle deposition. Other remarkable models in the literature are CFD models, which have many benefits compared to semi-empirical and 1D whole-lung models due to their use of realistic lung geometry and particle transport equations. However, most CFD models can predict the deposition of aerosol particles only in the oronasal and the upper RT. The major limitation of CFD-based models that prevents their full application is the requirement of high computational resources. Besides conventional models, which have been frequently used to simulate aerosol-particle deposition in the lungs, some reported ones use the advantages of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, the major limitation of these models is their requirement of big data from experiments for model development and training. The advantages and disadvantages of the mentioned models, with some recent updates, are briefly summarized below (Table 2).",

            "Rare in the literature Require extensive data to \u2022 develop and train the model.",
            "The above-noted models share the same limitations. One limitation comes from the complexity of the airway geometries and the unavailability of morphometric data. Another limitation relates to the difficulty of simulating realistic physiological conditions of the RT environment, especially for the AL region. Additionally, the complex physical and chemical phenomena related to dense and multicomponent aerosols make the modeling tasks more challenging to predict the deposition of aerosol accuracy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "There have been some efforts to improve the accuracy of conventional computational models for aerosol deposition in the human lung. For semi-empirical models, the development of ExDoM and ExDOM2 has aided in the calculation of aerosol dose, deposition, and retention, as well as the behavior of specific elements in the human body. Though some limitations remain, 1-D whole-lung models are still popular today due to their ease of use (for example, the MPPD software (ARA Inc, United States) can be freely downloaded and has a friendly user interface). However, for both semi-empirical and 1-D whole-lung models, the accuracies of these models should be further clarified in future research. For",
            "CFD models, the advances of the high-performance computing with supercomputers and thousands of CPUs can be used to reduce simulation time. In the near future, the presence of a new generation of supercomputers will continue to reduce simulation time. For ANN models, they are only useful when big data exist. Therefore, it is necessary to develop big data about the lung deposition of aerosol. In general, lung morphology data and experimental data about aerosol deposition should continue to be upgraded to develop and optimize all mentioned computational models.",
            "In order to overcome the limitations of the current models, one remarkable strategy is the combination of different models. For example, the CFD models and 1D whole lung model could be combined. In our opinion, the application of ANNs could also be used to reduce the complexity of conventional models or to improve their accuracies. For example, we can use 1D whole lung models or",

        "Introduction": [
            "The lung is an organ that is continuously exposed to environmental agents [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. As such, it can be negatively affected by toxic agents that are prevalent in the atmosphere [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].",
            "Kim et al (2019) compared different airway models based on CFD for air flows and particle deposition under various inspiratory conditions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>].",
            "In the ExDoM, the aerosol size distribution, the individual dose rate, the clearance of deposited particles, and the particle mass in each region of the lung during and after particle exposure and their transfer to the GI tract, lymph nodes, and blood can be calculated by Equations (1)\u2013(4) in the Supplementary Information."

        "Results": [
            "It is a common limitation that is seen in many studies that have applied the 1-D model for the prediction of aerosol particle deposition.",
            "This model could be used to calculate the total, regional, and generation-by-generation deposition of inhaled particles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].",
            "Because the deposition mechanisms in the lower airway are mainly gravitational, diffusional and are not affected by air-flow conditions, high computational resources are required for processing [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "Even for upper human airways, where the flow is mainly turbulent, Zang and Kleinstreuer (2011) showed that the RANS method, when using the standard k-\u03c9 turbulent model, could not compete with the LES computational method in general.",
            "Kleinstreuer et al (2007) and Vinchurkar et al (2012) compared the predictions of MT deposition and lung delivery by CFD models with in vivo data sets for metered dose inhalers (MDIs).",
            "The predicted total lung deposition for the monodisperse aerosol of 1\u20137 \u03bcm size has been found to be close to the in vivo data, with a relative error of 6%.",
            "Longest et al (2016) validated the use of whole-airway CFD with in vivo data to predict the deposition of DPI aerosols at multiple flow rates [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>]."
