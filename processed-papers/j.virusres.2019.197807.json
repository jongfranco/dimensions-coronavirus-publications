        "journal": "Virus Research",
        "volume": "276",
        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to knock out two non-essential gene fragments (TC7L-TK2L and TJ2R) related to virulence, immunomodulation, and host range in the vaccinia virus Tian Tan strain (VTT), and combining with double-label screening and exogenous screening marker knockout techniques to construct attenuated strains with multiple gene deletions(rVTT-TC-TJ). The shuttle plasmids pSK-TC and pSK-TJ were constructed by designing 2 pairs of recombinant arms, combined with poxvirus early and late complex strong promoter pE/L and exogenous screening marker enhanced green fluorescent protein(EGFP). The results showed that knocking out the two gene fragments does not affect the replication ability of the virus and displays a good genetic stability. Furthermore, a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that although virulence of rVTT-TC-TJ is attenuated significantly, high immunogenicity was maintained. These results support the potential development of rVTT-TC-TJ as a safe viral vector or vaccine.",
