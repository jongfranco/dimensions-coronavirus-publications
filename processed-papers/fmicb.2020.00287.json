            "Bacterial Strains<br/><br/>A total of 350 Francisella strains were used in this study, including three reference strains (F. novicida ATCC 15482; F. tularensis subsp. tularensis ATCC 6223; and F. tularensis subsp. holarctica Live Vaccine Strain, ATCC 29684) and 347 European isolates of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica (Supplementary Table S1). These field strains were collected mostly in France (n = 304), from 1947 to 2018. Other European strains isolated in Germany (n = 19), Sweden (n = 19), Spain (n = 4), and Belgium (n = 1) were also characterized. Strains were selected as diversely as possible in terms of geographic and temporal distribution to account for biodiversity in France and to be able to place them in a global phylogenetic context with the other European strains. Field strains were isolated from different host species (Supplementary Table S1): mostly wild hares (Lepus sp., n = 245), humans (n = 81, including 72 strains isolated from 2006 to 2018 from clinical cases in the collection of the French National Reference Center for Francisella), captive mammals (capybara \u2013 Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, non-human primates \u2013 unknown species, n = 13), wild mammals other than hares (rabbit \u2013 Oryctolagus cuniculus, wild boar \u2013 Sus scrofa, roe deer \u2013 Capreolus capreolus, n = 6), and ticks (unknown species, n = 2). Wild animals were collected thanks to the SAGIR network, which is an epidemiological surveillance network for terrestrial wild birds and mammals in France and aims to control wildlife diseases by monitoring mortality events without presuming etiology. F. tularensis species was confirmed by phenotypic methods and real-time PCR (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVersage_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rVersage_et+al_2003_a\">Versage et al, 2003</a>), and holarctica subspecies was confirmed by PCR (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTomaso_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rTomaso_et+al_2007_a\">Tomaso et al, 2007</a>)."

            "Genetic Diversity in France<br/><br/>In 2011, only subclade B.Br.FTNF002-00 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVogler_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rVogler_et+al_2011_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVogler_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rVogler_et+al_2011_a\">Vogler et al, 2011</a></a>) was identified as the major clade in France, reflecting low genetic diversity among Fth strains found in Western Europe, compared to those found in Eastern and Central Europe. Later, Dwibedi et al (2016) identified B.45, B.49, B.60, B.54, and B.55 (clade B.44) as the only subclades present in France. We have now highlighted the presence of almost all B.44-subclades in France, except for B.57, B.58, B.62, B.64, B.88, and B.90. Along with the identification of 87 new subclades, among which 82 derive from clade B.44, these results illustrate for the first time some genetic diversity among Fth isolates from France. Moreover, like<br/><br/><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVogler_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rVogler_et+al_2011_a\">Vogler et al (2011</a>), we identified clade B.12 among very few French isolates (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVogler_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rVogler_et+al_2011_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVogler_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rVogler_et+al_2011_a\">Vogler et al, 2011</a></a>). The four strains identified in clade B.12 (mostly found in Central and Eastern Europe) were isolated in the South of France, where it is known that hares were imported from Eastern Europe for hunting purposes. It is highly likely that tularemia was introduced from Eastern Europe to Western Europe because of this practice (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOlivier_2010_a\" href=\"#rOlivier_2010_a\">Olivier and MondainMonval, 2010</a>). Indeed, hares have frequently been released in France over the past 30 years and particularly in the South of France, with 1 to 3% of the national hare population consisting of imported hares (Office National de la Chasse et de la Faune Sauvage). For this reason, Vogler et al did not consider the B.12strains as representative of an ecologically established population in the South of France, even though this region neighbors the Alps region, where both clades B.6 and B.12 are detected (Dwibedi et al, 2016). Strict recommendations concerning imports are now given for countries that are considered infected by F. tularensis (World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), 2014). Nowadays, although no official statistics are available, released hares mostly originate from farms and, to a lesser extent, from imports. Further epidemiological surveillance of tularemia in France will help to decipher whether clade B.12 is naturally present in France."

In particular, the true reservoirs and the modes of long-term survival and spread of F. tularensis remain to be fully characterized.",
            "Recent improvements in our knowledge of the epidemiology of tularemia have been achieved by the development of genotyping methods. Considering the clonal nature of the pathogen (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJohansson_2010_a\" href=\"#rJohansson_2010_a\">Johansson and Petersen, 2010</a>), only molecular methods with high discriminatory power allow us to distinguish closely related subpopulations at the strain level. As such, genotyping of F. tularensis strains is now mostly based on the identification of canSNP at a whole-genome scale, as a result of significant reductions in sequencing costs. This technique can be used to investigate deep phylogenetic relationships and enables good discrimination of bacterial strains (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKeim_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rKeim_et+al_2004_a\">Keim et al, 2004</a>).

            "In Europe, tularemia has been reported only since the 1930s, and Eurasian Fth isolates are more closely related than Fth isolates from the United States, which suggests the spread of Fth strains from the United States to Eurasia (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJohansson_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rJohansson_et+al_2004_a\">Johansson et al, 2004</a>). Also, it has been hypothesized that the current population of Fth in Western Europe expanded clonally from a founder population that originated near the Eastern border, resulting in a gradual reduction in genetic diversity from Eastern to Western Europe (Dwibedi et al, 2016). Recent phylogeographic studies based on genetic relationships between F. tularensis isolates supported the hypothesis of long-range dispersal of this bacterium over time, associated with slow replication rates and long-term persistence in the environment (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKeim_2009_a\" href=\"#rKeim_2009_a\">Keim and Wagner, 2009</a>; Dwibedi et al, 2016).

Further studies confirmed that isolates from France belong to a single subclade of clade B.11: B.45, among closely related subclades B.49, B.60 (subclade of B.50), B.54 and B.55 (Dwibedi et al, 2016).",

The identification of specific and discriminative genetic markers and the investigation of phylogenetic relationships between isolates provided new knowledge about the epidemiology of tularemia in France. Obtaining the highest possible resolution was necessary to establish links between French Fth isolates, and potentially trace back the origin and history of contamination in a defined geographical area."

These field strains were collected mostly in France (n = 304), from 1947 to 2018. Other European strains isolated in Germany (n = 19), Sweden (n = 19), Spain (n = 4), and Belgium (n = 1) were also characterized. Strains were selected as diversely as possible in terms of geographic and temporal distribution to account for biodiversity in France and to be able to place them in a global phylogenetic context with the other European strains. Field strains were isolated from different host species (Supplementary Table S1): mostly wild hares (Lepus sp., n = 245), humans (n = 81, including 72 strains isolated from 2006 to 2018 from clinical cases in the collection of the French National Reference Center for Francisella), captive mammals (capybara \u2013 Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, non-human primates \u2013 unknown species, n = 13), wild mammals other than hares (rabbit \u2013 Oryctolagus cuniculus, wild boar \u2013 Sus scrofa, roe deer \u2013 Capreolus capreolus, n = 6), and ticks (unknown species, n = 2). Wild animals were collected thanks to the SAGIR network, which is an epidemiological surveillance network for terrestrial wild birds and mammals in France and aims to control wildlife diseases by monitoring mortality events without presuming etiology.

Almost 90% of the total strains (n = 312/350) were assigned to clade B.45 (a subclade of B.44), but 33% (n = 116/350) were not assigned to any further subclade. The remaining B.44 strains were assigned to B.46 (n = 2, including one strain in subclade B.63), or to B.44 without any further resolution (n = 3).

            "To obtain a higher resolution power, a whole-genome SNP analysis was carried out. We accurately reconstructed the population structure according to the global phylogenetic framework (Supplementary Figure S1). Based on SNP analysis, clade B.6 displayed very low genetic diversity compared to clade B.12 (Supplementary Figure S3). All strains assigned to clade B.12 displayed the A to C nucleotide change at position 2059 of the rrl gene (E. coli numbering), the SNP associated with erythromycin resistance (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKarlsson_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rKarlsson_et+al_2016_a\">Karlsson et al, 2016</a>), and showed in vitro erythromycin resistance (data not shown). Four strains isolated from the South of France appeared to share genotypes with B.12 isolates, which is consistent with the CanSNPer typing results (i.e. subclades 13 and B.39). By comparing the phylogenetic tree of the 350 strains with the CanSNPer results, new subclades were highlighted, among which 82 derived from clade B.44. On an alignment of 26,463 SNPs identified in our sample set, 87 canSNPs were therefore added to the canSNP nomenclature (Figure 2).",

These subclades were distinguished by one to three specific SNPs each. Clade B.45 formed a tight cluster composed of almost all strains from France. Seventy-nine new canSNPs were defined for this clade. Clade B.45 and all its subclades displayed a star phylogeny, i.e. \u201ca multifurcation with many short branches connected at an internal node,\u201d with an average of only one to three specific SNPs per branch. Most supported subclades were B.308 with nine specific variants (including one deletion) and B.298 with six specific variants (including two deletions). Seven other groups were well supported, with four to five specific SNPs each (B.234, B.244, B.261, B.272, B.291, B.294, and B.297 \u2013 bootstraps between 98 and 100). CanSNPs of clade B.44 were classified from D1 to D8 (corresponding to a gradual increase in discrimination) to facilitate investigation of the described clusters at different levels (Table 3). Newly identified canSNPs were implemented in the canSNP nomenclature and publicly available genomes were typed in silico (Supplementary Table S3). The following newly identified clades were detected among these publicly available genomes: B.228, B.251-254, B.260, B.262-B.265, B.269, B.279, B.284, B.285, B.288, B.290, B.291, B.295, B.301, B.305, and B.310-314. All newly identified canSNPs were confirmed as non-homoplastic, except for B.257 and B.288 that were also detected in two and one F. novicida strains, respectively (data not shown). However, as it does not concern F. tularensis species, these canSNPs were not excluded from the nomenclature.",

The difference between biovars was well established, with clade B.12 (D1) detected in Germany and Sweden, and clade B.6 (D1) detected in France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Belgium. More specifically, clade B.44 (D2) was the major clade identified in France (Figure 3A). Strains from France identified within clade B.12 (B.13 + B.39 \u2013 D2) were isolated only in the South East region of the country. Strains assigned to the newly identified clade B.228 (D3) were isolated mostly in the Alps region, near the Eastern border of France (Figure 3B). One B.230 strain (clade B.228\u2013229) was isolated",

However, we highlighted a significant association between some genotypes and their geographic distribution on the order of discrimination D4 (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p = 0.0005, Table 4). Indeed, clade B.49 was mostly isolated in the East of France (57%), while clades B.50, B.55, B.87, and B.251 were mostly isolated in the Western region of France (47, 47, 86, and 67%, respectively) (Table 4). These clades were associated with the highest number of strains and subclades. However, strains isolated over long geographic or temporal distances could share the same clade. Clade B.52, for example, was identified for strains isolated in France and Spain, from 1988 to 2016 and in 2008, respectively. However, three Spanish strains could be discriminated on the 5th order of discrimination D5 (B.291, a subclade of B.52 defined by four SNPs). Also, one strain isolated from a hare in 2012 in Germany clustered in the order of discrimination D7 (clade B.287) with two strains isolated in 2008 from capuchin monkeys (Cebus sp.) in a zoo and three strains isolated from humans who contracted oropharyngeal tularemia in 2008. Clade B.288 (D8) allowed us to discriminate strains that correspond to one of the rare grouped cases of tularemia. This reflects the need for highly discriminative SNPs to investigate tularemia outbreaks. Among the eight strains isolated in the same department, only one isolated in 1995 belonged to the same D4 clade (B.50). However, the two strains isolated from the capuchin monkeys (Cebus sp.) were isolated in a neighboring department during the same year and could be linked to this grouped case.",
            "A significant association between the geographic and genetic distance matrices was identified for strains isolated from hares between 1985 to 2018 in France (n = 204; Mantel\u2019s test, p = 0.002). However, this association was not identified within clades (order of discrimination D4) containing at least 10 strains of our sample set (B.45, B.49, B.50, B.55, B.87, B.250). We identified spatiotemporal clusters for clade B.45 (strains not assigned to any subclade on the order of discrimination D4) and clades B.49, B.87 and B.250. A spatiotemporal cluster for clade B.45 (n = 36) was identified in the Center of France, including 15 strains isolated from 1987 to 2012 (Figure 4A, p = 0.02). Another spatiotemporal cluster was detected for 19 strains belonging to clade B.49 (n = 51) in the East of France between 1988 and 2016 (Figure 4B, p = 0.004). Finally, two other clusters were identified for clade B.87 (n = 36) with 14 strains isolated from 1998 to 2018 in the West of France (Figure 4C, p = 0.0003), and for clade B.250 (n = 10) with 7 strains isolated in",

            "Over the last four decades, tularemia seems to have spread from Eastern-Central France to the northern and western areas of the country (Figures 5A\u2013D). Clades B.49, B.50, B.52, and B.55 (D4) were identified in strains isolated before 1990, and the new nomenclature enabled us to identify five other D4 clades (B.233, B.238, B.247, B.250, and B.251) that seemed to be part of the first genotypes observed in France (Figure 5A). Interestingly, strains assigned to clade B.45 on the 4th order of discrimination D4 (i.e. no canSNP detected after B.45) have been isolated since 1947 and were still isolated in 2018. Genotypes such as B.49, B.50, B.52, B.55, B.233, and B.247 (D4) were identified in strains isolated from non-neighboring French departments over a period of around 30 years (Figure 5). Clade B.251 also displayed strains isolated in non-neighboring departments but seems to have evolved mostly locally, from one French department (Maineet-Loire) to neighboring departments in the north-western area (Figure 5). Similarly to B.251, clade B.49 seems to have spread to the East from 1986 to 2018. Clade B.50 was, however, largely distributed across France, and most of the strains belonged to this clade (Table 1). Interestingly, clades that seemed to persist in France were also those displaying the highest number not only of strains but also of derived subclades, testifying to the evolution of these clades. Some clades seem to have disappeared, such as clade B.250 that comprised ten strains isolated from 1985 to 1987 in ten different departments of France (Figure 5A), or clade B.238 that was isolated only from 1988 to 1996 (Figures 5A,B). Clades B.259, B.260, and B.261 were isolated in the past but were no longer detected in recent years (Figures 5B,C). Conversely, certain genotypes seem to have emerged over the last few decades (Figures 5B\u2013D) \u2013 genotypes marked with a star. We can note that most of the clades were identified in strains isolated in the 1990s (Figure 5B). Some clades seem to be sporadic, as they were not identified in the last 10 (B.91 or B.259 - Figure 5C) to 20 years (B.92 - Figure 5B). Clade B.87 appeared in 1994 in the western areas and seemed to pursue its spread to the west and north (Figures 5B\u2013D). Clades B.54, B.240, and B.231 seem to be restricted to the eastern region (Figures 5B\u2013D). Interestingly, clade B.54 involved only human strains in our study. More recent genotypes have been identified, such as B.53 - formerly identified in Switzerland and Germany \u2013 that was isolated in 2007 near the northern border of France, and strains assigned to B.53 (n = 5) were strictly identical (no differences in SNPs nor INDELs). All",
            "13.3 of these results suggest that the genetic diversity of Fth strains is still evolving in France.",
            "Strains used in this study were mostly isolated from hares, but also from humans or others mammals (captive or wild), with some animal cases directly linked to human cases. No clustering was observed as different host species could share identical genotypes (Supplementary Figure S1), and no association between genotypes and host species was detected (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p > 0.05, data not shown). Therefore, there is no evidence of host specialization during the transmission of the bacterium. For example, genotype B.53 was shared between a European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) and the tick it was carrying (data not shown). Moreover, we observed that genotypes could differ among a given host species: two strains isolated during the same year in two roe deers (Capreolus capreolus) from the same department differed by 13 SNPs.",
            "Concerning strains from the collection of the French National Reference Center for Francisella, genotypes were not associated with clinical forms (Supplementary Figure S2A). Also, there was no clinical form that was more often diagnosed depending on the year of isolation (Supplementary Figure S2B). Concerning antibiotic resistance, besides the erythromycin resistance observed in biovar II, only blaFTU-1 (Accession: A7J11_01422), a gene coding for a class A beta lactamase, was detected in the studied strains. This gene is associated with betalactam resistance in F. tularensis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAntunes_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rAntunes_et+al_2012_a\">Antunes et al, 2012</a>)."

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "In 2011, only subclade B.Br.FTNF002-00 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVogler_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rVogler_et+al_2011_a\">Vogler et al, 2011</a>) was identified as the major clade in France, reflecting low genetic diversity among Fth strains found in Western Europe, compared to those found in Eastern and Central Europe. Later, Dwibedi et al (2016) identified B.45, B.49, B.60, B.54, and B.55 (clade B.44) as the only subclades present in France. We have now highlighted the presence of almost all B.44-subclades in France, except for B.57, B.58, B.62, B.64, B.88, and B.90. Along with the identification of 87 new subclades, among which 82 derive from clade B.44, these results illustrate for the first time some genetic diversity among Fth isolates from France. Moreover, like",
            "<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVogler_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rVogler_et+al_2011_a\">Vogler et al (2011</a>), we identified clade B.12 among very few French isolates (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVogler_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rVogler_et+al_2011_a\">Vogler et al, 2011</a>). The four strains identified in clade B.12 (mostly found in Central and Eastern Europe) were isolated in the South of France, where it is known that hares were imported from Eastern Europe for hunting purposes. It is highly likely that tularemia was introduced from Eastern Europe to Western Europe because of this practice (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOlivier_2010_a\" href=\"#rOlivier_2010_a\">Olivier and MondainMonval, 2010</a>). Indeed, hares have frequently been released in France over the past 30 years and particularly in the South of France, with 1 to 3% of the national hare population consisting of imported hares (Office National de la Chasse et de la Faune Sauvage). For this reason, Vogler et al did not consider the B.12strains as representative of an ecologically established population in the South of France, even though this region neighbors the Alps region, where both clades B.6 and B.12 are detected (Dwibedi et al, 2016). Strict recommendations concerning imports are now given for countries that are considered infected by F. tularensis (World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), 2014). Nowadays, although no official statistics are available, released hares mostly originate from farms and, to a lesser extent, from imports. Further epidemiological surveillance of tularemia in France will help to decipher whether clade B.12 is naturally present in France.",
            "We confirmed previous phylogeographic studies showing that clade B.12 is present in Central and Eastern Europe, while clade B.6 is restricted to Western Europe, with these two clades overlapping in countries of Central Europe (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVogler_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rVogler_et+al_2009_a\">Vogler et al, 2009</a>; Gyuranecz et al, 2012). We also confirmed in vitro and in silico erythromycin resistance for strains assigned to clade B.12 and in silico betalactam-resistance for all strains. These findings were consistent with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data obtained for strains at the French National Reference Center for Francisella (Caspar et al, 2018).",
            "The overrepresentation of clade B.11, and more particularly clade B.44, suggests the introduction and spread of one clone of Fth across France. The star phylogeny observed for clade B.44 and all its subclades, along with the relatively low diversity observed among our strains, demonstrate that rapid clonal expansion of a monophyletic population of F. tularensis occurred in Western Europe. Isolation of strains assigned to clade B.46 was limited to the Alps region and to Germany. It has been suggested that clade B.46 had a longer evolutionary history as the genetic diversity in this region was higher, and that the presence of all the major clades (B.11, B.45, B.46, B.47) in Switzerland was evidence for an evolutionarily older founder population (Dwibedi et al, 2016). Accordingly, the two strains assigned to clade B.46 in our study were isolated from the French Alps region. Since synchronicity between epidemics and epizootics has been highlighted by epidemiologic data (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMoerner_1992_a\" href=\"#rMoerner_1992_a\">M\u00f6rner, 1992</a>), a study on pathogenicity could then be carried out in order to determine whether the low number of isolates is due to a lower number of animals infected by strains of this clade, or whether animals succumb more rapidly to tularemia, making it difficult to detect strains in this clade. Moreover, as our collection of animal strains depends on the SAGIR surveillance network for France, collection of animals might not be equivalent for all areas (Moinet et al, 2016). The possibility that tularemia is underdiagnosed should thus be considered, especially when tularemia is not targeted, as only dead or dying animals are collected. Also, some regions might be more prone to hunting or might not contain the same biodiversity. To limit this collection bias, strain selection was carried out in order to account for biodiversity in France. Besides, identification of new markers highlighted a novel intermediate node, B.228, from which B.229 and B.46 derive. Therefore, there is a common ancestor to these two clades and clade B.229 was not identified in any other country than France, according to the genomes publicly available so far.",
            "We identified an association between clades (B.49, B.50, B.55, B.87, B.250, and B.251) and their geographic distribution. Interestingly, the fact that strains that belong to clade B.45, but that could not be discriminated at higher levels of resolution, formed a spatiotemporal cluster between 1987 and 2012 demonstrates that the bacterium is able to trigger outbreaks over long periods with a very slow mutation rate. Specifically, this spatiotemporal cluster was mostly located in an area of arable lands, where high densities of hares can be observed (Smith et al, 2005). We identified spatiotemporal clusters for clades B.49, B.87, and B.250 as well. Clade B.87 is relatively recent in France and seems to predominate in the West of France, according to the spatiotemporal cluster identified between 1998 and 2018, unlike clade B.49 for which a spatiotemporal cluster was identified between 1988 and 2016 in the East of France, testifying to its long-term presence on the French territory. Moreover, we identified a correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance in order of discrimination D4, which is consistent with the presence of these spatiotemporal clusters for the predominant clades. According to the concept of natural nidality of Pavlovsky (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPavlovsky_1966_a\" href=\"#rPavlovsky_1966_a\">Pavlovsky, 1966</a>), the bacterium could persist under defined conditions and trigger repeated outbreaks in certain locations, as proposed in Sweden by <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJohansson_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rJohansson_et+al_2014_a\">Johansson et al (2014</a>). However, inside genetic clades, we could not highlight any correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance. While a previous study highlighted this type of correlation for clade B.52 in Spain (Dwibedi et al, 2016), identification this clade in France in 1988 suggests dispersal of the bacterium from France to Spain as tularemia outbreaks in Spain have first been reported since 1997 (De Mateo and Ruiz Coisin, 1998; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAllue_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rAllue_et+al_2008_a\">Allue et al, 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAriza-Miguel_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rAriza-Miguel_et+al_2014_a\">Ariza-Miguel et al, 2014</a>). Moreover, the outbreak in 1997 was associated with hunting and handling of European brown hares (L. europaeus) in northwestern Spain, which seems to coincide with a spread from France to Spain.",
            "Dispersal of F. tularensis through animals could be explained by hare import (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOlivier_2010_a\" href=\"#rOlivier_2010_a\">Olivier and Mondain-Monval, 2010</a>), as hares are mostly sedentary, or by migratory birds, in which tickborne pathogens have been detected (Lopes de Carvalho et al, 2012). The role of birds in tularemia transmission was shown after a human case related to a buzzard (Buteo buteo) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPadeshki_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rPadeshki_et+al_2010_a\">Padeshki et al, 2010</a>). Hematophagous arthropod vectors (i.e. flies and mosquitoes) also play an important role but, at least in France, this role in tularemia transmission has been poorly studied. A recent study in Switzerland, where ticks were found to be the main cause of infection in humans (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLyko_2013_a\" href=\"#rLyko_2013_a\">Lyko and Chuard, 2013</a>), suggested that strains of clade B.45 were better adapted than other clades to arthropods vectors, as clade B.46 and the newly identified B.11 subclades were isolated only in humans and mammals (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWittwer_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rWittwer_et+al_2018_a\">Wittwer et al, 2018</a>). However, in France, tick bites represent only around 10% of tularemia cases (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMaurin_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rMaurin_et+al_2011_a\">Maurin et al, 2011</a>) and <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMichelet_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rMichelet_et+al_2014_a\">Michelet et al (2014</a>) suggested that the risk of acquiring tularemia from ticks \u2013 Ixodes ricinus at least \u2013 was negligible. The nature of the epidemiological cycle (terrestrial or aquatic) remains to be elucidated. In Scandinavia, where the aquatic cycle predominates, mosquitoes represent the principal reservoir of tularemia and triggered significant outbreaks (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTaernvik_2007_a\" href=\"#rTaernvik_2007_a\">T\u00e4rnvik, 2007</a>). Also, recent studies have demonstrated the role of flower nectar in the F. tularensis lifecycle with mosquitoes as vectors (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKenney_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rKenney_et+al_2017_a\">Kenney et al, 2017</a>). In Norway, human outbreaks of water-borne tularemia have been linked with high population density of lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) and drinking water from wells contaminated by carcasses of infected lemmings (Berdal et al, 2000; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLarssen_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rLarssen_et+al_2011_a\">Larssen et al, 2011</a>). In France, for three human cases linked to water exposure in the same river between 2009 and 2014, water samples were analyzed but Francisella sp. Was not identified (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGuerpillon_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rGuerpillon_et+al_2016_a\">Guerpillon et al, 2016</a>). Therefore, further investigations need to be conducted on the persistence of F. tularensis in water, especially in France. Windassisted dispersal is also one of the hypotheses for the spread of F. tularensis across long distances. Otherwise, long-range dispersal of similar clones of F. tularensis could be related to the low pathogenicity observed among Fth. Finally, by infecting hosts without killing them, contrarily to Ftt, the bacterium would be able to spread more rapidly and over longer distances. In Europe, differences in disease characteristics in brown hares (L. europaeus) have been observed, with splenitis and hepatitis in hares infected with strains belonging to clade B.FTNF00200, and polyserositis when infected with clade B.13 (subclade of B.12) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKreizinger_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rKreizinger_et+al_2016_a\">Kreizinger et al, 2016</a>). Further investigations should be conducted on this difference of pathogenicity between clades of Western Europe and clades of Central and Eastern Europe.",
            "As tularemia presents complex epidemiologic cycles that have not yet been elucidated (terrestrial and aquatic cycles, wide range of host species and reservoirs, possible transmission through vectors), it is likely that some biotopes or climatic conditions could influence components of these cycles and thus favor or hinder the spread and infection capacities of some clades. Clade B.250 illustrates this hypothesis as it was identified only between 1985 and 1987. The fact that a spatiotemporal cluster was identified for this clade (p = 0.0001) is consistent with this observation. We can therefore assume that the fitness of genotypes depends on specific conditions, such as cold waves that occurred in France in January 1985, February 1986, and January 1987. Climatic factors could affect either the bacterium, the host, or the vectors in terms of survival or activity. Such clades might have been adapted to a certain kind of climate, or there might have been a change in animal movements that led to the emergence and the disappearance of this clade in France. Also, in the 1980s, a significant decrease in the hare population in France was observed after the emergence of European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMarchandeau_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rMarchandeau_et+al_2011_a\">Marchandeau et al, 2011</a>), which could explain the disappearance of these clades by lack of hosts. It is also conceivable that hunting might influence the hare population and therefore be responsible for the disappearance of some clades. Among many hypotheses explaining the disappearance of some clades, it is known that pesticides are responsible for considerable ecosystem changes and might modify animal habitats. It has also been shown that exposure to certain pesticides could potentiate the pathogenicity of tularemia in brown hares (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBandouchova_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rBandouchova_et+al_2011_a\">Bandouchova et al, 2011</a>), or pesticides could be more toxic to tularemia-infected voles (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVidal_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rVidal_et+al_2009_a\">Vidal et al, 2009</a>). Considering that hares most likely live around cultivated plains and cereal crops, the relationship between areas where pesticides are used (e.g. intensive farming areas) and tularemia could also be investigated.",
            "The fact that identical genotypes could be identified over long geographic or temporal distances could suggest convergent evolution. However, as only non-homoplastic markers were selected, the existence of several groups sharing the same genotype in non-neighboring geographic areas, and over such long periods of time, supports the hypotheses of the ability of F. tularensis to persist in a quiescent stage and/or spread over long distances. The fact that clades that persist in France are associated with the highest number of strains and subclades also shows that some clades are more likely to thrive, but further investigations need to be conducted to assess why these clades are more able than others to survive and evolve. Some cladespecific SNPs were identified as non-synonymous variants, and it is known that synonymous SNPs might still play a role in the regulation of gene expression or the level of protein synthesis, even if they do not affect the protein sequence (Shabalina et al, 2013). However, 62% of the detected variants (including INDELs, data not shown) were responsible for silent mutations and it is difficult to assess whether the SNPs result from an adaptation process. Moreover, most of the identified genetic clades were supported by only one or a few variants. According to the neutral theory (Kimura, 1968), the vast majority of substitutions are unlikely to influence selective pressure, and evolution might rely on genetic drift at the molecular level. Genome-wide association studies will therefore be performed on the pan-genome in order to identify accessory genes (i.e. genes that are not shared by all strains) responsible for this distribution. When using such a large number of strains, we were able to observe that published markers resulted from variants that could be transient. This means that the persistence of the mutation over time is not yet proven, and that the concerned clade might disappear with natural selection, as some variants might not be fixed to the phylogenetic tree leaves. For example, a small group of six strains assigned to clade B.49 was not phylogenetically associated with the majority of clade B.49-strains, and one strain clustered with two other strains assigned to clade B.251 and B.45 (one order of discrimination less than B.49-Supplementary Figure S1). This shows that they shared more similarities phylogenetically between them than with other strains of their canSNP clade. As most canSNPs have been designed on final leaves of phylogenetic trees, selected SNPs are specific to these strains but actually do not allow us to place them accurately in a phylogenetic context. Therefore, for phylogenetic purposes, it is of great importance to select specific and robust SNPs (non-homoplastic SNPs with high bootstraps). However, as these canSNPs still clustered a large number of strains, we do not refute their importance in the canSNP nomenclature. Moreover, as canSNPs identified in our study were validated in vitro, and were well detected among publicly available genomes, low bootstrap canSNPs were kept as they could still provide information about some strains. Considering the ability of F. tularensis to persist with a slow replication rate and travel long distances over short periods of time, a clade that disappeared years ago in France could still reemerge. Therefore, all subclade-specific SNPs were considered relevant and were implemented in the canSNP nomenclature. In order to further investigate the epidemiology of F. tularensis routinely and at lower cost, a high-resolution molecular typing tool is being designed in our laboratory for clades identified in France. This typing tool will be used according to the purpose of the study, with the appropriate order of discrimination: high level of resolution for outbreak investigation, or low level of resolution for long-term epidemiologic surveillance."

        "CONCLUSION": [
            "In conclusion, we identified clade B.44 as the major clade present in France and identified 82 new subclades in this clade. The star phylogeny observed in clade B.44 subclades reveals that the biodiversity of F. tularensis in France is relatively recent and results from clonal expansion of a single population. We also highlighted specific features of the epidemiology of the bacterium, where F. tularensis is able to spread and thrive locally with a slow replication rate, but can also travel long distances since identical genotypes could be identified at large geographic but also temporal distances."
