            "Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first reported from Wuhan, China in December 2019. It was rapidly spread to other regions of China, to the neighboring countries including Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and Malaysia, and even to a few Western countries. As of February 11, the total number of the reported cases is 43,112 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], which far exceeded the number of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). According to Wu et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was estimated to be 2.68 (95% confidence interval, 2.47-2.86), which indicates that more than two new cases are generated by a single infected patient. The estimated reproduction numbers of SARS and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) ranged from 2 to 5 and from 2.7 to 3.9, respectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. For the patient outcome, Huang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] initially reported that mortality rate of COVID-19 was 15% (6/41). However, later studies reported lower mortality rates from 4.3% to 11% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. According to an online dashboard developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the mortality rate is 2.4% (1018/43112) as of February 11 and the mortality rate outside China is much lower (0.4%; 2/464) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].
