        "abstract": "Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city in China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and other countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. Methods: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (g), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. Findings: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96\u20132.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89\u20134.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0. Conclusion: The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks. ",

            "The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported and confirmed in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019 (World Health Organization, 2020a). As of January<br/><br/>26 (17:00 GMT), 2020, there have been 2033 confirmed cases of 2019nCoV infections in mainland China, including 56 deaths (National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2020). The 2019-nCoV cases were also reported in Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US, and all of these cases were exported from Wuhan; see the World Health Organization (WHO) news release https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ from January 14\u201321. The outbreak is still ongoing.

            "The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported and confirmed in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019 (World Health Organization, 2020a). As of January",

The 2019-nCoV cases were also reported in Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US, and all of these cases were exported from Wuhan; see the World Health Organization (WHO) news release https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ from January 14\u201321. The outbreak is still ongoing. A recently published preprint by Imai et al estimated that a total of 1723 (95% CI: 427-4471) cases of 2019nCoV infections in Wuhan had onset of symptoms by January 12, 2020 (Imai et al, 2020). The likelihood of travel related risks of disease spreading is suggested by Bogoch et al (2020), which indicates the potentials of regional and global spread (Leung et al, 2020).",
            "To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing peer-reviewed literature quantifying the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV as of January 22, 2020. In this study, we estimated the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV via the basic reproduction number, R0, based on the limited data in the early phase of the outbreak."

To adjust the impact of this event, we considered a time-varying reporting rate that follows a linear increasing trend, motivated by the previous study (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2010_a\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). We assumed that the reporting rate, r(t), started increasing on January 17, and stopped at the maximal level on January 21. The reporting rate increase corresponds to accounts for the announcement on improving the 2019-nCoV surveillance of the Hubei provincial government (Hubei provincial government, 2020). The length of the reporting increasing part roughly equals the average of the incubation periods of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, i.e., the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), i.e., 5 days (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBauch_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rBauch_et+al_2005_a\">Bauch et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLin_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rLin_et+al_2018_a\">Lin et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDonnelly_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rDonnelly_et+al_2003_a\">Donnelly et al, 2003</a>).

            "Instead of finding the exact value of r(t), we calculated the fold change in r(t) that is defined by the ratio of r on January 10 over that on January 24 minus 1. We illustrated six scenarios with 0- (no change), 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 4- and 8-fold increase in reporting rate, see Figure 1(a), (c), (e), (g), (i) and (k).",
            "Following previous studies (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhao_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rZhao_et+al_2019_a\">Zhao et al, 2019</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cde_Silva_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rde_Silva_et+al_2009_a\">de Silva et al, 2009</a>), we modelled the epidemic curve obeying the exponential growth.

Since the transmission chain of 2019nCoV remains unclear, we adopted the SI information from SARS and MERS, which share a similar pathogen as 2019-nCoV.

Although six scenarios about the reporting rate were explored in this study, the real situation is difficult to determine given limited data and (almost) equivalent model fitting performance in terms of R-squared. However, with increasing reporting rate, we found the mean R0 is likely to be between 2 and 3.",
            "Our analysis and estimation of R0 rely on the accuracy of the SI of 2019-nCoV, which remains unknown as of January 25. In this work, we employed the SIs of SARS and MERS as approximations to that of 2019-nCoV. The determination of SI requires knowledge of the chain of disease transmission that needs a sufficient number of patient samples and periods of time for follow-up (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCowling_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rCowling_et+al_2009_a\">Cowling et al, 2009</a>), and thus this is unlikely to be achieved shortly. However, using SIs of SARS and MERS as approximation could provide an insight to the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV at the early stage of the outbreak. We reported that the mean R0 of 2019-nCoV is likely to be from 2.24 (8-fold) to 3.58 (2-fold), and it is largely in the range of those of SARS, i.e., 2-5 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBauch_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rBauch_et+al_2005_a\">Bauch et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLipsitch_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rLipsitch_et+al_2003_a\">Lipsitch et al, 2003</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWallinga_2004_a\" href=\"#rWallinga_2004_a\">Wallinga and Teunis, 2004</a>), and MERS, i.e., 2.7-3.9 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLin_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rLin_et+al_2018_a\">Lin et al, 2018</a>).",

However, many of the existing online preprints estimate the mean R0 ranging from 2 to 5 (Imai et al, 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRiou_2020_a\" href=\"#rRiou_2020_a\">Riou and Althaus, 2020</a>; Read et al, 2020; Shen et al, 2020), which is largely consistent with our results."
