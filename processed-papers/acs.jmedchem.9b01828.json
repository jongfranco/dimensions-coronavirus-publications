        "abstract": "The main protease of coronaviruses and the 3C protease of enteroviruses share a similar active-site architecture and a unique requirement for glutamine in the P1 position of the substrate. Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued a structure-based design of peptidomimetic \u03b1-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease\u2212inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the \u03b1ketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera. The best near-equipotent inhibitors, 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl) and 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl), display low-micromolar EC50 values against enteroviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures. In Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells, 11r exhibits three-digit picomolar activity against the Middle East Respiratory",

            "In spite of the considerable threat posed by SARS-CoV and related viruses, as well as by MERS-CoV, it is obvious that the number of cases so far does not warrant the commercial development of an antiviral drug targeting MERS- and SARSCoV even if a projected steady growth of the number of MERS cases is taken into account.

However, enteroviruses are very different from coronaviruses. While both of them have a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity, that of enteroviruses is very small (just 7\u22129 kb), whereas coronaviruses feature the largest RNA genome known to date (27\u221234 kb). Enteroviruses are small, naked particles, whereas coronaviruses are much larger and enveloped. Nevertheless, a related feature shared by these two groups of viruses is their type of major protease,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] which in the enteroviruses is encoded by the 3C region of the genome (hence the protease is designated 3Cpro). In coronaviruses, nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease (Mpro). Similar to the enteroviral 3Cpro, it is a cysteine protease in the vast majority of cases and has, therefore, also been called a \u2032\u20323C-like protease\u201d (3CLpro). The first crystal structure of a CoV Mpro or 3CLpro (ref 22) revealed that two of the three domains of the enzyme together resemble the chymotrypsinlike fold of the enteroviral 3Cpro, but there is an additional \u03b1helical domain that is involved in the dimerization of the protease (Figure 1A). This dimerization is essential for the catalytic activity of the CoV Mpro, whereas the enteroviral 3Cpro (Figure 1B) functions as a monomer. Further, the enteroviral 3Cpro features a classical Cys\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7His\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Glu/Asp catalytic triad, whereas the CoV Mpro only has a Cys\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7His dyad.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] Yet, there are a number of common features shared between the two types of proteases, in particular their almost absolute requirement for Gln in the P1 position of the substrate and space for only small amino-acid residues such as Gly, Ala, or Ser in the P1\u2032 position, encouraging us to explore the coronaviral Mpro and the enteroviral 3Cpro as a common target for the design of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds. The fact that there is no known human protease with a specificity for Gln at the cleavage site of the substrate increases the attractiveness of this viral target, as there is hope that the inhibitors to be developed will not show toxicity versus the host cell. Indeed, neither the enterovirus 3Cpro inhibitor rupintrivir, which was developed as a treatment of the common cold caused by HRV, nor the peptide aldehyde inhibitor of the",

For EV-A71 3Cpro, however, the activity decreased to IC50 = 13.8 \u03bcM, different from CVB3 3Cpro, where IC50 was 3.8 \u03bcM. Our interpretation of this result is that the smaller P2-isobutyl substituent of 11n can still interact with the \u201clid\u201d (in particular, Met49) of the SARS-CoV Mpro S2 site, but is unable to reach the \u201cback wall\u201d of the EV-A71 3Cpro pocket and thus, in the absence of a \u201clid\u201d, cannot generate sufficient enthalpy of binding. We will see from examples to follow that this trend persists among all inhibitors with a smaller P2 substituent: Even though the SARS-CoV Mpro S2 pocket has a larger volume than that of the enterovirus 3Cpro, the enzyme can be efficiently inhibited by compounds carrying a small P2 residue that makes hydrophobic interactions with the lid (Met49) and floor (Met165) residues.",

The affinity of 11s for the S2 pocket of HCoV-NL63 Mpro is good because of an almost ideal match of size and not requiring conformational changes, which this enzyme would not be able to undergo because of the replacement of the flexible Gln[189] by the more rigid Pro.",

            "Obviously, this substituent was still a bit too small for the enterovirus proteases, so as the next step, we tested P2 = cyclopentylmethyl (compound 11u). This turned out to be the one compound with acceptable IC50 values against all tested enzymes: 1.3 \u03bcM against SARS-CoV Mpro, 5.4 \u03bcM against HCoV-NL63 Mpro, 4.7 \u03bcM against EV-A71 3Cpro, and 1.9 \u03bcM against CVB3 3Cpro (Table 1). The activity against the replicons was between 3.6 and 4.9 \u03bcM (Table 2). In Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells infected with HCoV 229E or MERS-CoV, 11u showed an EC50 = 2.5 or 0.03 \u03bcM (11.1 \u03bcM for MERS-CoV in Vero cells), while the EC50 was 4.9 \u03bcM against SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells (Table 3).",
            "Compound 11u appeared so far the best compromise compound, yet for each of the individual viral enzymes, the following compounds proved superior: P2 = cyclopropylmethyl (compound 11s) for SARS-CoV Mpro, P2 = isobutyl (compound 11n) and P2 = cyclopropylmethyl (11s) for HCoV-NL63 Mpro, P2 = benzyl (11a) or cyclohexylmethyl (11r) for EV-A71 3Cpro, and 11r for CVB3 3Cpro. In other words, the nearly equipotent 11u is indeed a compromise. Therefore, in view of the surprisingly good antiviral activity of 11r against HCoV 229E in Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells, we relaxed the condition that the universal inhibitor should show good activity against the recombinant HCoV-NL63 Mpro and selected 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl) as the lead compound for further development. This compound exhibited submicromolar IC50 values against CVB3 3Cpro and SARS-CoV Mpro and IC50 = 1.7 \u03bcM against EV-A71 3Cpro (Table 1), as well as similarly low EC50 values in the replicons of these viruses (Table 2). In Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells infected with MERS-CoV, the performance of this compound was excellent, with EC50 =",

Also, in enterovirusinfected cell cultures, the compound performed well, with EC50 values of 0.7 \u03bcM or below against HRV2, HRV14, and EV-D68 in HeLa (Rh) cells and selectivity values > 15. The only concern is the activity of the compound against EV-A71 in RD cells, for which the EC50 value was 3.7 \u03bcM, resulting in too low a therapeutic index. On the other hand, only weak toxicity was detected for 11r in Vero or Huh-T7 cells. Preliminary pharmacokinetics tests with the compound in mice did not indicate a toxicity problem (to be published elsewhere)."

            "In addition to better matching the H-bonding donor/ acceptor properties of the catalytic center through offering two hydrogen-bond acceptors instead of one, \u03b1-ketoamides have another big advantage over aldehydes and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters (Michael acceptors) in that they allow easy extension of the inhibitors to probe the primed specificity subsites beyond S1\u2032, although this has so far rarely been explored (e.g., ref 38 in the case of calpain). The most prominent \u03b1-ketoamide drugs are probably telaprivir and boceprivir, peptidomimetic inhibitors of the HCV NS3/4A protease,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>] which have helped revolutionize the treatment of chronic HCV infections. For viral cysteine proteases, \u03b1-ketoamides have only occasionally been described as inhibitors, and few systematic studies have been carried out. A number of capped dipeptidyl \u03b1-ketoamides have been described as inhibitors of the norovirus 3C-like protease.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>] These were optimized with respect to their P1\u2032 substituent, whereas P2 was isobutyl in most cases and occasionally benzyl.",
            "The former displayed IC50 values 1 order of magnitude lower than the latter, indicating that the S2 pocket of the norovirus",
            "Among a series of aldehydes, Prior et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>] described the capped tripeptidyl \u03b1-ketoamide Cbz-1-naphthylalanine-LeuGln-Lactam-CO\u2212CO-NH-iPr, which showed IC50 values in the three-digit nanomolar range against HRV 3Cpro and SARSCoV Mpro, as well as EC50 values of 0.03 \u03bcM against HRV18 and 0.5 \u03bcM against HCoV 229E in cell cultures. No optimization of this compound was performed, and no toxicity data have been reported. For compounds with warheads other than \u03b1-ketoamides, in vitro activity against both corona- and enteroviruses has also occasionally been reported. Lee et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>] described three peptidyl Michael acceptors that displayed inhibitory activity against the Mpros of SARS-CoV and HCoV 229E as well as against the 3Cpro of CVB3. These inhibitors had an IC50 10\u221220 times higher for the CVB3 enzyme, compared to SARS-CoV Mpro. P2 was invariably isobutyl (leucine) in these compounds, suggesting that further improvement might be possible.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]",
            "In addition to Michael acceptors, peptide aldehydes have also been used to explore the inhibition of coronavirus Mpros as well as enterovirus 3Cpros. Kim et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] reported a dipeptidyl aldehyde and its bisulfite adduct, both of which exhibited good inhibitory activities against the isolated 3C proteases of human rhinovirus and poliovirus as well as against the 3C-like proteases of a number of coronaviruses, but antiviral activities in cell culture against EV-A71 were poor (EC50 > 10 \u03bcM), again most probably due to P2 being isobutyl (leucine).",
            "In our series of compounds, we used P1 = Gln-Lactam (\u03b3lactam) throughout because this substituent has proven to be an excellent surrogate for glutamine.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] While we made some efforts to optimize the P1\u2032 residue of the compounds as well as the N-cap (P3), we mainly focused on optimization of the P2 substituent.

            "B3 (enterovirus proteases), we found that the S2 pocket has fundamentally different shapes in these enzymes. In the SARSCoV Mpro, the S2 subsite is a deep hydrophobic pocket that is truly three-dimensional in shape: the \u201cwalls\u201d of the groove are formed by the polypeptide main chain around residues 186\u2212",
            "188 as well as by the side chains of His[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>] (of the catalytic dyad) and Gln[189], whereas the \u201cfloor\u201d is formed by Met[165] and the \u201clid\u201d by residues 45\u221251, in particular Met[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>]. The two methionines provide important interaction points for the P2 substituents of inhibitors; while these interactions are mostly hydrophobic in character, we have previously described the surprising observation of the carboxylate of an aspartic residue in P2 that made polar interactions with the sulfur atoms of these methionines.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] Because the pocket offers so many opportunities for interaction and features a pronounced plasticity, P2 substituents such as isobutyl (from Leu), which are too small to fill the pocket entirely, can still generate sufficient binding enthalpy. Accordingly, the S2 pocket of SARS-CoV Mpro is the most tolerant among the three enzymes investigated here, in terms of versatility of the P2 substituents accepted. In the S2 pocket of the HCoV-NL63 Mpro, Gln[189] is replaced by proline, and this change is accompanied by a significant loss of flexibility; whereas the side chain of Gln[189] of SARS-CoV Mpro is found to accommodate its conformation according to the steric requirements of the P2 substituent, the proline is less flexible, leading to a much smaller space at the entrance to the pocket. As a consequence, a P2-benzyl substituent is hindered from penetrating deeply into the pocket, whereas the smaller and more flexible isobutyl group of",
            "P2-Leu is not. Finally, in the 3Cpros of EV-A71 and CVB3, the S2 pocket lacks a lid; i.e., it is open to one side. As a consequence, it offers fewer interaction points for P2 substituents of inhibitors so that such substituents must reach the \u201cback wall\u201d of the pocket (formed by Arg[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>], Asn[69], and Glu71) in order to create sufficient binding energy. Hence, large aromatic substituents such as benzyl are favored by the enterovirus 3Cpros.",
            "When we introduced a fluoro substituent in the para position of the P2-benzyl group of our lead compound, 11a, we observed good activity against the enterovirus 3Cpros but complete inactivity against the coronavirus Mpros (see Table 1, compound 11m). This is easily explained on the basis of the crystal structures: In the enterovirus 3Cpros, the fluorine can accept a hydrogen bond from Arg[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>] (ref 30), whereas in the coronavirus Mpros, there would be electrostatic repulsion from the main-chain carbonyls of residues 186 and 188. In agreement with this, rupintrivir (which has P2 = pfluorobenzyl) is a good inhibitor of the enteroviral 3Cpros,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>] but not of the coronaviral main proteases, as we predicted earlier.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]",
            "In this structure-based inhibitor optimization study, we achieved major improvements over our original lead compound, 11a, by systematically varying the size and the flexibility of the P2 substituent. The compound presenting so far the best compromise between the different requirements of the S2 pockets (SARS-CoV Mpro, large and covered; HCoVNL63 Mpro, small and covered; CVB3 3Cpro, large and open) is",
            "11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl), which has satisfactory broadspectrum activity against all proteases tested. However, with regard to its antiviral activities in cell cultures, it is inferior to 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl). The latter compound exhibits very good inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV Mpro as well as the enterovirus 3Cpro, and its performance in the SARSCoV and enterovirus replicons is convincing. Being in the low micromolar range (EV-A71, CVB3), the data for the antiviral activity in cell cultures for 11r correlate well with the inhibitory power of the compound against the recombinant proteases as well as in the replicon-based assays. This is not true, though, for the surprisingly good in cellulo activity of 11r against HCoV 229E in Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells. Also, the correlation does not seem to hold for LLC-MK2 and CaCo2 cells. We tested the antiviral activity of many of our compounds against HCoV NL63 in these two cell types and found that all of them had low or submicromolar EC50 values against this virus in LLC-MK2 cells but were largely inactive in CaCo2 cells (not shown). Furthermore, 11r and all other compounds that we synthesized are inactive (EC50 > 87 \u03bcM) against CVB3 in Vero cells (not shown), but exhibit good to excellent activities against the same virus in Huh-T7 cells. We have previously observed similar poor antiviral activities in Vero cells not only for \u03b1ketoamides but also for Michael acceptors (Zhu et al, unpublished work). A similar cell-type dependence is seen for the antiviral activity of 11r against MERS-CoV and SARSCoV. Whereas the inhibitor exhibits excellent activity against MERS-CoV when Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells are the host cells (400 pM), the inhibitory activity is weaker by a factor of up to 12,500 when Vero cells are used (EC50 = 5 \u03bcM). On the other hand, 11r exhibits excellent anti-MERS-CoV activity in human Calu[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] lung cells, i.e., in the primary target cells, where the compound will have to act in a therapeutic setting (A. Kupke, personal communication). As we tested antiviral activity against SARSCoV exclusively in Vero cells, the EC50 values determined for our compounds against this virus are in the one-digit micromolar range or higher; the best is again compound 11r with EC50 = 2.1 \u03bcM. Interestingly, the relatively weaker activity (or even inactivity) of our inhibitors against RNA viruses in Vero cells was observed independently in the virology laboratories in Leuven and in Leiden. It is thus unlikely that the lack of activity in Vero cells is related to problems with the experimental setup. In preliminary experiments, we replaced the P3 cinnamoyl group of 11r by the fluorophor coumaryl and found by fluorescence microscopy that much more inhibitor appeared to accumulate in Huh[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] cells compared to Vero cells (D.L., R.H. and Irina Majoul, unpublished).",
            "Regardless of which cell system is the most suitable one for the testing of peptidomimetic antiviral compounds, we next plan to test 11r in small-animal models for MERS and for Coxsackievirus-induced pancreatitis. In parallel, we aim to refine the experiments to quantify the accumulation of peptidomimetic protease inhibitors in different host-cell types in the hope of finding an explanation for the observed cell-type dependencies."

        "<h2 style=\"display: inline\">Introduction:</h2> Seventeen years have passed since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, but there is yet no approved treatment for infections with the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] One of the reasons is that, despite the devastating consequences of SARS for the affected patients, the development of an antiviral drug against this virus would not be commercially viable in view of the fact that the virus has been rapidly contained and did not reappear since 2004.",
        "The potential for human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been impressively demonstrated by the 2015 outbreak in South",
        "<h2 style=\"display: inline\">Results:</h2> The authors' efforts to design novel \u03b1-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus Mpros and enterovirus 3Cpros started with a detailed analysis of the following crystal structures of unliganded target enzymes: SARS-CoV Mpro; bat coronavirus HKU4 Mpro as a surrogate for the closely related MERS-CoV protease (our.",
        "During the course of the present study, the authors determined crystal structures of a number of lead \u03b1-ketoamide compounds in complex with SARS-CoV Mpro, HCoV-NL63 Mpro, and CVB3 3Cpro, in support of the design of improvements in the round of lead optimization.",
        "The main protease of the newly discovered coronavirus linked to the Wuhan outbreak of respiratory illness is 96% identical (98% similar) in the aminoacid sequence to that of SARS-CoV Mpro, so all results reported here for the inhibition of SARS-CoV will most likely apply to the new virus",

        "Introduction": [
            "Seventeen years have passed since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, but there is yet no approved treatment for infections with the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] One of the reasons is that, despite the devastating consequences of SARS for the affected patients, the development of an antiviral drug against this virus would not be commercially viable in view of the fact that the virus has been rapidly contained and did not reappear since 2004.",
            "The potential for human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been impressively demonstrated by the 2015 outbreak in South"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "The authors' efforts to design novel \u03b1-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus Mpros and enterovirus 3Cpros started with a detailed analysis of the following crystal structures of unliganded target enzymes: SARS-CoV Mpro; bat coronavirus HKU4 Mpro as a surrogate for the closely related MERS-CoV protease (our.",
            "During the course of the present study, the authors determined crystal structures of a number of lead \u03b1-ketoamide compounds in complex with SARS-CoV Mpro, HCoV-NL63 Mpro, and CVB3 3Cpro, in support of the design of improvements in the round of lead optimization.",
            "The main protease of the newly discovered coronavirus linked to the Wuhan outbreak of respiratory illness is 96% identical (98% similar) in the aminoacid sequence to that of SARS-CoV Mpro, so all results reported here for the inhibition of SARS-CoV will most likely apply to the new virus"
