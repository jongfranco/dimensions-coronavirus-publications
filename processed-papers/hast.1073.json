            "The exploitation of human research subjects, particularly of African American subjects, forms part of the background to much of the mistrust that Laura Specker Sullivan is concerned with in this issue\u2019s lead article. In \u201cTrust, Risk, and Race in American Medicine,\u201d Specker Sullivan, a philosopher at the College of Charleston, contextualizes patient mistrust of clinicians and the health care system within a history of racism in the United States in general and in the country\u2019s biomedical research and clinical institutions specifically. Acknowledging that the necessary work of eradicating racism and other systemic injustice will take a great deal of time and effort, Specker Sullivan proposes ways for individual clinicians to improve relationships with distrustful patients and their families now. It is not enough, she asserts, for physicians to emphasize their qualifications and express their care. They need to endeavor to comprehend the patient\u2019s or family\u2019s wariness and to signal that understanding, verbally and through clinical care.",
            "Two commentaries provide additional insights and recommendations about the work of earning patient trust. Dinushika Mohottige and Ebony Boulware, who begin by observing that well-warranted mistrust is felt by patients from various populations, describe five steps clinicians should take. These require virtues including empathy, cultural humility, and the humble open-mindedness that enables collaboration and ongoing self-education. Alan Elbaum, who focuses on caring for black patients, concentrates on the efforts clinicians must make before they can signal true comprehension of a patient\u2019s mistrust. This should involve asking if oneself and one\u2019s institution are, in fact, serving the patient\u2019s best interests.",
