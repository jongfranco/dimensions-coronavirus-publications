However, due to the quite low sensitivity, short of supply and a relatively long period of new coronavirus nucleic acid kits, suspected cases with false-negative results remain a severe problem. Besides, a long incubation period (3\u20137 days, up to 14 days) and superior transmission capacity of new viruses contribute to the fast spread of 2019-nCoV. Under the circumstances, computed tomography imaging is not only useful for the detection, location of lesions but also helpful in the evaluation of the dynamic changes of patients with 2019-nCoV.",

CT images (9 February 2020) manifested as extensive groundglass opacities, consolidation in bilateral lungs. Oddly, compared with CT images of the last two times (Figure 1C), all the lesions were found in different locations (Figure 1D). On 11 February 2020, he received a real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction of the throat swab again, and the results were still positive."
