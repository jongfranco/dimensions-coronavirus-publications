Samples from the nasopharynx continue to remain positive up to day 16 of admission. Our infant likely acquired the SARSCoV-2 virus from a household member, but it was difficult to ascertain the day of infection as there were no reported symptoms.

            "A well 6-month-old boy was referred to KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital (KKH) on 4 February 2020. His mother and live-in helper were admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) isolation unit on 3 February 2020 for pneumonia and were undergoing investigations for COVID-19. His mother\u2019s occupation involved close contact with tourists from China. She did not have any recent travel history. Her symptoms of fever and sore throat started on 29 January 2020. Chest X-ray showed left lower zone consolidation and she was classified as a suspect case. Her first nasopharyngeal swab on 3 February 2020 was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The infant\u2019s father developed fever and sore throat on 1 February 2020 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Disease (NCID) isolation unit on 4 February 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 testing. As the infant had no remaining well caregivers, he was brought to KKH for clinical assessment and isolation in light of his close contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases.",
            "The infant was asymptomatic on arrival to the hospital. He was afebrile with no tachypnea. Oxygen saturation was 98% on room air and his lungs were clear to auscultation. As his respiratory status was stable, no chest radiograph was performed.",
            "A nasopharyngeal specimen taken on admission and tested by rRT-PCR confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection with low cycle threshold (N gene, 15.57; Orf1ab gene, 13.73), suggesting high viral load. Rapid multiplex respiratory pathogens nucleic acid amplification test (BioFire FilmArray RP2, BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) was negative for all pathogens, including influenza A and B and 4 human coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1). On day 2 of admission, he was found to be viremic with detection of SARS-CoV-2 in his blood sample via rRT-PCR. However, stool and urine samples from the same day were negative. During this viremic phase, he had 1 temperature record of 38.5\u00b0C which normalized within 1 hour. Otherwise, he was afebrile and remained asymptomatic throughout admission. Daily nasopharyngeal swabs continued to be positive for SARSCoV-2 (Figure 1) and eventually became negative on day 17 of admission. Biochemical markers showed normal liver function tests on day 2 and day 8 of admission. His full blood count was normal on day 2 but neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 0.9 x 109/L, normal range: 1.5-8.5 \u00d7 109/L) occurred on day 8 of admission. Repeat testing of his urine on day 9 of admission was negative, but his stool sample became positive for SARS-CoV-2. He did not have any gastrointestinal symptoms before or throughout this admission. His mother was transferred from SGH to KKH on 6 February 2020 to unite with her child. She became afebrile on 5 February (day 8 of illness) and continued to have dry cough until 11 February (day 14 of illness). Her respiratory status was stable without oxygen requirement. Her daily nasopharyngeal specimens were positive from 3 February to 6 February at SGH and subsequently fluctuated near detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1). She had initial leukopenia (2.6 \u00d7 109/L, normal range: 4.0-10.0 \u00d7 109/L), neutropenia (1.2 \u00d7 109/L, normal range: 2.0-7.5 \u00d7 109/L) and thrombocytopenia (106 \u00d7 109/L, normal range: 140-440 X 109/L), which resolved on day 14 of illness. Breastmilk samples on day 11 of illness were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Her nasopharyngeal swabs returned negative on day 18 of illness. Both patients remained well in the KKH isolation unit at the time of writing (day 18 of infant\u2019s admission)."

            "During the global SARS-CoV epidemic, the majority of children had a benign course of illness with mild respiratory symptoms and there were no deaths reported in the pediatric population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. The reason for young children under 12 year of age being less affected by the infection was unknown. One of the hypotheses proposed was a blunted immune dysregulation response towards the SARS-CoV infection in children [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. As COVID-19 originates from the \u03b2-coronavirus genus group which SARS-CoV belongs to, we may observe similar illness trajectories in both pediatric infections.",
            "Following the outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan and export of cases to countries worldwide, there was an urgent need to contain the spread of the novel virus. Quick and accurate identification of cases for isolation or quarantine remains a key pillar of public health efforts to contain an emerging epidemic. This strategy is dependent on accurate case definitions to identify patients for further management, including testing if available. Most of the current case definitions used globally are developed based on clinical signs and symptoms collated from COVID-19 in adults, which include either acute respiratory symptoms or more severe signs of lower respiratory tract infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. While most adults with COVID-19 infection have fever, respiratory symptoms and/or chest X-ray changes, current data suggest that the majority of the infected children have mild or no symptoms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Our case highlights a likelihood of poor performance of current case definitions used to contain COVID-19, especially in infants. There is an urgent need to better understand the full clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in the pediatric population in order to refine public health containment strategies.",
