            "This book provides readers with a comprehensive and up-to-date guide to non-invasive mechanical ventilation in palliative medicine, focusing on why and when it may be necessary. Physicians will find a practical guide to this specific context, particularly focused on pulmonary function and physiology in the elderly, and on ventilatory management in surgery and chronic stable conditions. The book provides detailed information on the rationale for invasive and non-invasive ventilation, the different modes of ventilation, indications and contraindications, prognostic factors, and outcomes. It addresses in detail the role of postoperative mechanical ventilation following various forms of surgery, and discusses key aspects of withdrawal from ventilatory support. Attention is also devoted to the use of mechanical ventilation within and beyond the ICU. The concluding part of the book focuses on important topics such as ethics, legal issues, home mechanical ventilation, drug therapy, rehabilitation and end-of-life."
