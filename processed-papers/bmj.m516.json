            "In an emergency, propaganda gets classic\u2014banners, notices, loudspeakers, mass text messages. The older generation have a high level of trust in the government, many having worked for state owned enterprises and expect lifelong support. They do what they\u2019re told, wrote Lavender Au, a health tech watcher at the media outlet TechNode, who was under lockdown in Hubei province (which contains Wuhan) and awaiting evacuation to her parents in London.",
            "As Chinese military medical staff were flown into Wuhan\u2019s quickly built 1000 bed hospitals, the situation in Wuhan was dire, said Au: it seemed like a disaster zone, she told The BMJ. She has read posts about doctors not eating because they\u2019re too scared to take off protective clothing in case they don\u2019t get new supplies, as well as stories of people dying at home because there aren\u2019t enough hospital beds.",
            "Finding doctors prepared to comment is hard, so those willing to do so get a lot of attention, which is sometimes critical. Cai Yi, an infectious disease doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, responds to online criticism on his Sina Weibo blog: \u201cWe are not stupid, but patients keep on coming, and we don\u2019t have enough isolation spots for them. We might not be wearing the most standard protective clothing or the very best medical masks. We are simply treating too many patients to avoid risk.\u201d"

        "Keeping people informed": [
            "A source from China\u2019s public health system told The BMJ that his organisation was working hard to keep people informed, writing ever more technical reports for lay readers and medical practitioners. He told The BMJ on 4 February that, with no test kit for the new virus, processing samples was tremendously time consuming. \u201cPeople are working without a break to control the epidemic, and the spread of misinformation only makes disease control more difficult,\u201d he said.",
            "I\u2019ve received messages from friends around the world deciding whether to postpone their return to Beijing. Family members checked on me. Expats shared memes showing face masks made from bra cups, water bottles, or gourds. Q-Mex, a local diner, offered discounted cases of Corona beer. Movingly, the social media app WeChat was full of videos shot from Hubei high rises showing people barricaded on their balconies shouting, \u201cJiayou Wuhan!\u201d meaning \u201cCome on, Wuhan!\u201d",
            "Meanwhile, a visit to a local graphic design company early this week found an empty office building and 60 bottles of industrial detergent lined up at reception. The smell of chlorine was overpowering.",
            "the city has the expertise and facilities to deal with a mass viral outbreak if it were to occur. I\u2019m not sure if other countries, including the UK, can say the same.\u201d",
