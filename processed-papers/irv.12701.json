        "abstract": "Background: In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic potential and clinical impact of an automated multiplex PCR platform (the FilmArray Respiratory Panel; FA-RP), specially designed for pathogen detection in respiratory tract infections in adults with unexplained pneumonia (UP). Methods: A total of 112 UP patients in Shanghai, China, were enrolled prospectively and assessed using the FA-RP from October 2016 to March 2018. We examined the test results and their influence on clinical decisions. Furthermore, as a control group, we retrospectively obtained the clinical data of 70 UP patients between October 2014 and March 2016 (before the FA-RP was available). The two patient groups were compared with respect to factors, including general antimicrobial use and defined daily dose (DDD) numbers. Results: Between October 2016 and March 2018, the positive rate obtained using FA-RP for UP was 76.8%. The primary pathogens in adults with UP were Influenza A/B (47.3%, 53/112). Compared with the patients before FA-RP was available, patients who underwent FA-RP testing had higher rates of antiviral drug use and antibiotic de-escalation during clinical treatment. FA-RP significantly decreased the total DDDs of antibiotic or antifungal drugs DDDs by 7 days after admission (10.6 \u00b1 2.5 vs 14.1 \u00b1 8.8, P < .01). Conclusions: The FA-RP is a rapid and sensitive nucleic acid amplification test method for UP diagnosis in adults. The application of FA-RP may lead to a more accurately targeted antimicrobial treatment and reduced use of antibiotic/antifungal drugs.",

            "In conclusion, the FA-RP is a rapid and sensitive NAAT method that can be used for the diagnosis of UP in adults. In the two recent years in Shanghai, the most common pathogen causing UP was identified as the Influenza virus. However, in this regard, it should be taken into consideration that the current version of the FA-RP is unable to directly detect H7N9. Nevertheless, the results obtained in this study show that the FA-RP may make a valuable contribution to clinical decision making and facilitate the reasonable use of antibiotics."

            "After the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, in order to track similarly highly contagious and severe lower respiratory illness with pneumonia symptoms, the Chinese government has paid great attention to unexplained pneumonia (UP), a phrase coined by the Chinese Human Unexplained Pneumonia Surveillance Network (CHUPSN) and published in 2004. UP refers to pneumonia, which could be life-threatening, characterized by rapid progression, a normal white blood cell count range, and poor response to antibiotics.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Although the common pathogens causing UP are viruses or atypical pathogens, their overlapping clinical manifestations can impede the ability of clinicians to directly diagnose the causative pathogens, which may lead to unnecessary antimicrobial usage. Thus, rapid and precise diagnosis of the causative agents is critical for the prompt management of UP.<br/><br/>To date, culture-based and other traditional methods have been used to help the clinical approach to diagnose UP; however, these methods have certain disadvantages. For example, rapid antigen testing has only a 40%-100% sensitivity for adult influenza and is dependent on the use of specific scientific techniques, whereas culturing viruses can take up to 10 days.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)\u2013based methods for the detection of viral pathogens due to their excellent diagnostic ability in identifying a broad spectrum of pathogens.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] FilmArray multiplex PCR (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc, a bioM\u00e9rieux Company) is a NAAT method that can be used to detect multiple pathogens in a single test.

Indeed, we obtained positive FA-RP results for all the types of respiratory tract specimens. Notably, however, when performing this test, pre-treatment of specimens with high viscosity, such as sputum, is essential; otherwise, the reactions are likely to fail. Here, we pretreated samples following the procedure described by Branche,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] using a clean swab to stir the sputum and then placing it into VTM, so that the pathogens were transferred into a low viscosity medium that is suitable for the FA-RP.

            "It is worth noting that for the commercial FA-RP used in the present study, identification of Influenza A virus is limited to the H3, H1, and 2009-H1 subtypes, whereas for other subtypes, such as H7N9, the FA-RP can only provide the vague result of \u201cnot subtyped Influenza A.\u201d However, in mainland China, Influenza A virus H7N9 is one of the epidemic strains associated with UP,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] and indeed, this strain was particularly prevalent during the winter and spring of 2016-2017. Compared with other Influenza A infection, H7N9 patients tend to present with a more clinically severe manifestation and require more aggressive treatment. Thus, in these cases, further subtyping is necessary. In the study, we obtained test results of \u201cInfluenza A virus not subtyped\u201d in 13 cases, among which 11 were finally identified as H7N9 based on real-time PCR.

            "The rapid identification of pathogens causing respiratory tract infection has both essential clinical and public health values. In the present study, 15 of the enrolled patients were promptly isolated as soon as the diagnosis of Influenza virus infection had been established. In contrast, for the control group patients who did not receive precise diagnosis of causing agents, no comparable isolation measures were undertaken. Such a lack of an accurate diagnosis may lead to a delay in patient isolation and, consequently, the wider spread of viruses. Moreover, for these patients, we consciously sought to regularly analyze the viral nucleic acids in the patient's respiratory specimens using real-time PCR, and patients were discharged only after the nucleic acid test proved negative, thereby reducing the risk of the disease spreading.",
            "To further evaluate the clinical impact of the FA-RP, we compared the antibiotic use of adult UP patients in the FA-RP cohort and the historical control cohort, the latter of which were diagnosed only by using conventional methods. We found that compared with the control cohort, the intervention group had significantly lower antimicrobial DDDs, particularly with respect to the use of antibiotics and antifungal drugs. These results thus serve to highlight that given the benefit of an accurate diagnosis of the etiology, a more reasonable antibiotic usage could be achieved. These results are partially consistent with the findings of some previously published studies. For example, Rogers et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] evaluated the outcomes in pediatric patients (3 months to 21 years old) admitted to hospital with an acute respiratory illness, and, similar to the findings of the present study, found that the use of FA-RP facilitated a reduction in the duration of antibiotic use and the length of hospitalization. However, another randomized controlled trial discovered that use of the FA-RP was not associated with a reduction in the overall duration of antibiotic usage.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Nevertheless, a higher number of patients in the FA-RP group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics than those in the control group. Given these inconclusive findings, further studies are required concerning the impact of FA-RP on the clinical decisions regarding pneumonia.",
            "We compared the duration of hospital stay between the two groups. As a result, intervention group unexpectedly showed longer duration of hospital stay than the control group (12.1 vs 7.6 days, P = .001). One reasonable explanation is that subjects in the intervention group had more severe cases of pneumonia than those in the control group (higher PSI, Table 3), that is, a more severe condition may lead to a prolonged hospital stay. More importantly, stricter criteria of discharge were required for the intervention group. According to regulations sanctioned by the Chinese Ministry of Public Health in 2009, discharge of Influenza A H1N1 patients demands both a recovery of condition and two consecutive negative test results of viral nucleic acid in respiratory specimens. Therefore, intervention group patients positive for Influenza A took follow-up PCR tests. The patients could not be discharged from the hospital until they met the criteria. In contrast, for the control group, lacking precise diagnosis of causing agents, no such criteria were required. In our practice, application of FA-RP prolonged the length of stay; however, we believe additional benefits concerning public health and disease control were achieved.",
            "This present study is one of the several that have examined the application of FA-RP in Asia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] Compared with other published studies, our study focused on adults with more severe pneumonia conditions, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the only study that has covered two consecutive pandemic seasons. More importantly, it describes the positive clinical impacts of the FA-RP, particularly in terms of antibiotic use. Similarly, Duan et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] examined the use of the FA-RP in the management of lower respiratory tract infections in a larger population in Beijing. A shorter length of hospitalization and a reduction in antibiotic use were observed. Other studies, however, tended to focus on the performance of the FA-RP or merely a description of the detected pathogens.",
            "Our study does, however, have a few limitations. Notably, the sample size was limited, and the study was conducted only at a single location, which may thus limit the general applicability of the findings. In addition, the study included two cohorts from different time periods; hence, there may have been differences in factors that influenced clinician behavior between the two periods that were not accounted in our analysis. Furthermore, the incidence of various respiratory viruses may have varied across the two periods that may thus limit the validity of a direct comparison of clinical outcomes.",
            "In conclusion, the FA-RP is a rapid and sensitive NAAT method that can be used for the diagnosis of UP in adults. In the two recent years in Shanghai, the most common pathogen causing UP was identified as the Influenza virus. However, in this regard, it should be taken into consideration that the current version of the FA-RP is unable to directly detect H7N9. Nevertheless, the results obtained in this study show that the FA-RP may make a valuable contribution to clinical decision making and facilitate the reasonable use of antibiotics."
