            "Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus infection has shown the clinical epidemiological characteristics of rapid spread and the capability to infect a susceptible general population. The pathogen belongs to the \u03b2-type coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) (1-3). Its genetic characteristics are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (MERS coronavirus, MERS-CoV) (4,5). The main route of transmission is via respiratory droplets, and it can also be transmitted through contact. Additionally, current studies have suggested that 2019-nCoV may be transmitted through the fecal-oral route as well (6). Pregnant women have been found infected with 2019-nCoV, and the youngest child patient with positive 2019-nCoV test reported thus far is 36 hours old. As of now, two cases of neonates with positive 2019-nCoV tests have been reported and the route of vertical-transmission cannot be ruled out."

Thus, obstetrics and pediatrics must jointly evaluate the maternal and fetal conditions and choose the best time, mode, and place for delivery (14). For example, a special delivery room or operating room (a negative pressure room is recommended) can be prepared along with an isolation protection device, so as to minimize the damage to the mother and fetus.",

If the suspected or diagnosed mother and her breast milk test negative for 2019-nCoV, infants should be fed with breast milk. Donor milk can be considered for use after being screened for 2019-nCoV, because the virus may be excreted into the milk during the incubation period.",

Suspected and confirmed neonates should be treated in designated hospitals with effective isolation and protective equipment. Suspected newborns should be isolated and treated in a single room, and confirmed cases should be admitted into separate rooms from suspected ones.",
            "The neonatal department should be subdivided into transitional, quarantine, and general wards. Before neonates enter the department, doctors should determine which ward they should be assigned to base on the results of triage. Suspected or confirmed neonates are suggested to be placed in an incubator. Usage of an open rescue table should be prohibited in order to avoid cross transmission of the virus. Diagnosis and treatment items (stethoscope, thermometer, etc.) and nursing facilities should be kept for their particular use.

As a final measure (VII), a head cover should be placed on the suspected neonates who are using auxiliary ventilation. A negative pressure suction tube can be placed in the head cover, with the outlet end of the ventilator connected with a filter and then connected to a negative pressure suction device; a closed loop sputum suction tube can be affixed to the sputum suction with a resuscitation bag for the artificial ventilation connected with the filter device.",

Patients\u2019 non-disposable medical fabrics should be collected by the bedside and disinfected with chlorine-containing solution for more than 10 minutes (the concentration of disinfectant should also comply with local recommendations), and then be disposed of according to protocols of infectious medical fabric. The final disinfection of the patient's room should involve hydrogen peroxide atomization or gasification, or chlorine-containing solution spray disinfection.",

If the newborn is asymptomatic after birth and the suspected mother tests negative for 2019-nCoV, the newborn can be roomed with the mother; if the maternal testing is positive for 2019-nCoV, maternal quarantine is required, the neonate needs to be isolated, and a 2019-nCoV test should be conducted. If the test is negative, the newborn can be routinely cared for by the guardian; however, if the test is positive, the case should be managed in accordance with the management of diagnosed newborns. If the infants show clinical symptoms of suspected 2019-nCoV, they need to be admitted into the neonatal department for further diagnosis and treatment.",
            "Maternal separation may cause anxiety to parents and maternal depression (14), and thus psychological comfort should be offered, and the newborns should be fed with donor milk. All of the above situations should be communicated to and fully understood by parents. Social workers or supportive consultants can provide help to facilitate communication."
