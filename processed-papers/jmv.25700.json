        "abstract": "There is a rising global concern for the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019\u2010 nCoV). Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome. We confirm high sequence similarity (>99%) between all sequenced 2019\u2010 nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019\u2010nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019\u2010nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8\u2010encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti\u2010coronavirus approaches.",

The mutation in ORF8 resulting in one of its two variants, ORF8\u2010L and ORF8\u2010S, is predicted to be affecting the structural disorder of the protein. Specifically, the amino acidic region aa83\u2010aa[89] is more likely to be disordered in the ORF8\u2010S isoform."

            "We collected 53 full genomic 2019\u2010nCoV sequences from the Gisaid database (Table S1), plus the GenBank\u2010deposited sequence from the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101 (NC_045512.2) and two partial sequences from Italian isolates (EPI_ISL_406959 and EPI_ISL_406960). To compare 2019\u2010nCoVs with closely related viral species, we obtained six sequences from distinct human SARS genomes from GenBank (the reference NC_004718.3, plus the genomes AY274119.3, GU553363.1, DQ182595.1, AY297028.1, and AY515512.1). We also obtained six BCoV genomic sequences (DQ022305.2, DQ648857.1, JX993987.1, KJ473816.1, MG772934.1, EPI_ISL_402131). Finally, as more distantly related beta\u2010CoVs we analyzed also MERS genomes from GenBank entries JX869059.2 and KT368829.1.",
            "Similarly to a previous report with 10 virus specimens,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] we detected very high conservation between the 56 analyzed 2019\u2010nCoV genomes, with sequence identity above 99%. We found a bat CoV genome (Gisaid EPI_ISL_402131) with 96.2% sequence identity (and query coverage above 99%) to the 2019\u2010nCoV reference sequence (NC_045512.2), while the previously reported closest bat CoV (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45) has a sequence similarity of 88%.6 The reference human SARS genome (NC_004718.3) appears more distant from the reference 2019\u2010nCoV, with sequence identity of 80.26% and query coverage of 98%.",
            "Given the high homogeneity between 2019\u2010nCoV genomes, we developed a novel method to classify genomic sequences, based on CATPCA.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Briefly, this analysis finds the eigenvectors describing the highest variance within a categorical dataset, like ours. Our dataset derived from the MUSCLE MSA of 70 genomes and generated 32 206 positions: the categories in each coordinate could be A (Adenine), C (Cytosine), G (Guanine; T [Thymine], although being an single strand RNA virus, it would be more appropriate to use U [Uracil]), N (Nucleotide, uncertain location: very rare in this dataset, and accounting for only nine positions, or 0.0004% of all the data).",
            "Our analysis shows similar results for phylogenetic tree representations. In Figure 2A, we show the catPCA of the first components for all analyzed genomes. The MERS/non\u2010MERS grouping accounts for the largest variance, while SARS and SARS\u2010like BCoVs cluster together. While 2019\u2010nCoV constitute a tightly similar cluster, the two bat virus sequences MG772934.1 and EPI_ISL_402131 appear to be linking the human 2019\u2010nCoV to the Bat coronaviridae.",
            "A catPCA analysis on the sole 2019\u2010nCoV sequences highlights some internal variability (Figure 2B), with two likely outliers identified in the genome EPI_ISL_406862 (collected in Germany) and EPI_ISL_406592 (collected in Shenzhen, China).",
            "Although the variability within the 2019\u2010nCoV genomes is very low, we set out to discover possible hotspots of hypervariability within the viral population. We analyzed the approximately 30 000 nt of multiple",
            "For each position of the multialigned 54 2019\u2010nCoV, we calculated Shannon Entropy as a measure of the position variability.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Apart from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, likely nonprotein coding and less homogeneous, we identified two hotspots of hypervariability at positions 8789 and 28151 (Figure 3B,C).",
            "Position 8789 witnesses the presence of either T (U) or C, and it falls within the polyprotein gene. It causes a synonymous variation in the nucleotide triplet encoding for Serine 2839 (amino acid coordinates based on the reference genome NC_045512.2), so it is likely not to introduce phenotypical differences between the different strains.",
            "On the other hand, position 28151 falls within ORF8 and is characterized by the presence of either a C or a U. This causes a Ser/Leu change in amino acid (aa) 84, which can affect the conformation of the peptide, given that Serine is a polar amino acid, and Leucine is nonpolar. Aa84 appears to be nonconserved also across other coronaviridae (Figure 4A, black arrow).",
            "We analyzed the alternative isoforms of 2019\u2010nCoV ORF8\u2010aa[84] alternative isoforms, dubbed ORF8\u2010L (Leucine) and ORF8\u2010S (Serine). Unfortunately, no crystal structures of close homologs to the ORF8 protein are available for a reliable homology modeling to measure the structural impact of this amino acid substitution. The closest 3D model to 2019\u2010nCoV ORF8 available in Protein Data Bank[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] is a short",
            "22 amino acid stretch in the protein entry 6P65, with a nonsignificant E\u2010value of 0.848. We, therefore, employed de novo methods to infer the structural features of ORF8. One important effect we could detect is a significant effect of Serine in ORF8\u2010S in inducing structural disorder in the protein C\u2010terminal portion, which is not predicted to be present in the ORF8\u2010L (Figure 4B), using the Russell/Linding algorithm.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] Moreover, it did not escape our attention that the ORF8\u2010S could theoretically generate a novel phosphorylation target for the mammalian host Serine/Threonine kinases of the host organism. So, we searched for ORF8 homologous substrates in the Mammalia NCBI nr protein database, but could not find matches within the E\u2010value threshold of 1.",
