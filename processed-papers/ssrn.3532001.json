Total fourteen articles were downloaded from the net and read 10 to 20 times in depth and analyzed the situation and draw the conclusion. The result indicates that corona virus problem was raised in late December 2019 in Wuhan and Hubei provinces in China. The hub of the center was Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the source of the virus was bat soup. A team at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led by virologist Zheng-Li Shi isolated the virus from a 49-year-old woman, who developed symptoms on 23 December 2019 before becoming critically ill. Doctor, Li Wenliang on 31 December told that an unknown virus has been developed in the province of Wuhan and Hubei provinces as like SARS and MERS. The symptoms were found fever, throat sore and sneezing by woman in the hospital. The Doctor Li has shared the knowledge on E-Chat while police department has declared the rumors against the country and told to Dr.Li to delete the said statement from the E-Chat and keep the data in secrecy while latter on 20, January, 2020 it was announced by government media that Corona Virus has killed many people in the provinces of Wuhan and Hubei. Due to late coverage in the mean time the virus was spread to the whole world which has damaged majority people in their area and emergency was announced by China and world Health Organization. They have sealed majority airports and visas were cancelled by different countries in the world. Globally 4594 cases of the corona Virus was confirmed. China total confirmed cases number was 4537 while 6973 were suspected and 976 were found severe and 106 deaths were recorded. Similarly outside of China 57 cases were confirmed and 16 countries were declared affected. According to data Japan affected number was 6, Republic of Korea 4, Viet Nam 2 ,Singapore 7. Australia 5, Malaysia 4, Cambodia 1, Thailand 14, Nepal 1, Sri Lanka 1, United States of America 5, Canada 2, France 3, Germany 1 and Pakistan 1. World Health Organization has tried best for its controlling and the Director General did meeting with the President Xi Jiping for overcoming this problems in the emergency in china. World Pathologists\u2019 were informed for Vaccine preparation. Similarly world economy has been damaged and the economy of the China was highly affected by this virus and the new year program was halted on the spot The China has struggled best and its program was highly appreciated for this virus controlling. The review further shows that the people of the China are very patriotic and they made hospital in day night for treatment of the affected people by virus. The review further explains that through sneezing and human contact the virus were spread to whole community of the world. So for protection purpose Wuhan and Hubei provinces were sealed for further spreading this virus. Masks were prepared in for protection of community. On the basis of problems the following recommendations were suggested for its controlling in future. Mostly Halal food should be provided to China community in future. World wise Quarantines should be developed by each country for different germs protection; Good hospital and quality Doctors should be produced by each country; Give freedom to media for awareness of community to take action in time to protect the world from the epidemic disease; Safety net should be provided by WHO in the developing countries in time. More funds should be provided to health department in the world. Similarly research fund should be increased in all hospital of the world for conducting research on the medical background. Testing laboratories and food inspectors should be multiplied for protection of different diseases in the world.",
