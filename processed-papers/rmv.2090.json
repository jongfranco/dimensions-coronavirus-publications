The virus causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections mostly in young children and contributes to hospitalization of individuals with asthma,chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and cancer. Moreover, hMPV pauses a considerable socio\u2010economic impact creating a substantial disease burden wherever it has been studied, although hMPV testing is relatively new in many countries. We aimed to comprehensively analyze the epidemiological aspects including prevalence, disease burden and seasonality of hMPV infections in children in the world. We acquired published data extracted from PubMed and PubMed Central articles using the title and abstract (TIAB)search strategy for the major key words on hMPV infections from 9/54 African, 11/35 American, 20/50 Asian, 2/14 Australian/Oceanian and 20/51 European countries. According to the findings of this review, the prevalence of hMPV infection ranges from 1.1 to 86% in children of less than 5 years of age globally. Presence of many hMPV genotypes (A1, A2, B1, B2) and sub\u2010genotypes (A2a, A2b, A2c, B2a, B2b) suggests a rapid evolution of the virus with limited influence by time and geography. hMPV infection mostly affects children between 2 to 5 years of age. The virus is active throughout the year in the tropics and epidemics occur during the winter and spring in temperate climates, contributing to a substantial disease burden globally.",
