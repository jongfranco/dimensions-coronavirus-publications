            "FAO is providing forecasts, early warning and alerts on the timing, scale and location of invasions and breeding. The speed of the pest\u2019s spread and the size of the infestations are so far beyond the norm that they have stretched the capacities of local and national authorities to the limit.",
            "Given the scale of the current swarms, aerial control is the only effective means to reduce the locust numbers. Aerial operations need to be upscaled substantially and very quickly in Ethiopia and Kenya. In addition, \u201calongside pest control activities our response must include efforts to restore people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d said FAO\u2019s Director-General.",
            "Ethiopia\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture said efforts were underway to prevent the spread of the outbreak. According to Sani Redi, state minister of agriculture, further swarms are spreading to the southern, south-western and south-eastern parts of the country. Data from the Ministry of Agriculture show that between three and five swarms of locusts, each with a population of 40-80m, crosses into Ethiopia every day from neighbouring countries. The invasion could last until June in Ethiopia, Redi said.",
            "\u201cThere are 13m people in the affected countries who are severely food insecure now,\u201d said Mark Lowcock during a UN press conference. \u201cTen million of those people are in the places affected by locusts.\u201d",

            "According to Lowcock, the FAO estimated at the end of January that a locust control plan would cost $76m. \u201cWhat we have so far is just $20m,\u201d he said.",
            "Lowcock said the locust outbreak was \u201cthe worst for 70 years in Kenya, for 25 years in Ethiopia, Somalia,\u201d and that one of the reasons behind the swarms was climate change. An increased number of cyclones in the Indian Ocean has provided more pasturage in the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn for locusts to eat and consequently breed in record numbers, he explained.",
            "The FAO says the current invasion is known as an \u201cupsurge\u201d \u2013 when an entire region is affected \u2013 however, if it gets worse and cannot be contained, over a year or more, it would become what is known as a \u201cplague\u201d of locusts.",

The swarms are highly mobile; the terrain often difficult; the logistical challenges immense. But left unchecked \u2013 and with expected additional rains \u2013 locust numbers in East Africa could increase 500 times by June.",
            "The massive swarms entered Kenya in December and have torn through pastureland in the north and centre of the country. The Agriculture Ministry said it would take at least six months to control the locusts, highlighting a threat to food security as Kenya\u2019s breadbasket regions prepare for the main crop season starting in March. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya also cited a lack of an effective chemical in the local market, adding that the fight against the insect has been slowed down by long procurement and import bureaucracies. Munya said the situation had been worsened by the lapses in handling the locust threat when they were first spotted in northern Kenya.",
            "The Treasury has termed the invasion by desert locusts as a \u201csystemic risk\u201d that might prevent the Kenyan economy from attaining its medium-term growth target of 7%. However, some economists have played down the threat, saying it poses minimal impact on growth.",

Entitled Strengthening Domestic Revenue Mobilisation to Sustain Growth in a Fragile State, the report notes that the improved security situation is leading to brighter economic prospects, with the real GDP growth rate estimated at 4.8% for 2019. The authors indicate that although the country\u2019s growth rate has outpaced that of countries in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) and Sub-Saharan Africa, it continues to lag behind peer countries such as Burkina Faso, Malawi, Mali, Niger, and Uganda.",
            "\u201cCAR has not experienced sustained growth since gaining independence in 1960. With the signing of the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in February 2019, the economic outlook is, however, positive,\u201d states Wilfried A. Kouame, World Bank economist and lead author of the report. \u201cThe successful implementation of the peace agreement is critical for jumpstarting growth. By implementing this agreement in the run-up to the elections, we are expecting growth of around 5% in the medium term.\u201d",
            "The report also reveals that while CAR is still at high risk for debt distress, its efforts to streamline public expenditure and clear domestic arrears are driving down the public debt level to below CEMAC and Sub-Saharan Africa averages and bringing it closer to the debt levels of its peers.",
            "The report presents a number of options to address the growing needs of Central Africans: i) Strengthen the social contract: The social contract between the state and its citizens, which is vital to mobilising tax revenue, was undermined by the recent crisis. To strengthen the social contract, the state must undertake to improve the efficiency and quality of goods and social services, while restoring the trust of taxpayers to encourage them to move out of the informal sector and pay their taxes.",
            "ii) Broaden the tax base: CAR\u2019s tax revenue currently accounts for approximately 8% of GDP, which is below its potential and among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. CAR could consider increasing the tax rates on alcohol and tobacco products in the short term and reducing the number of tax brackets that hinder business creation and development in the long term.",
            "iii) Improve property tax collection: Legislation on property taxation has not been updated to reflect recent economic developments. Current revenue collection is inefficient and is based on a declarative system that narrows the tax base. New legislation could generate close to CFA francs 12bn (roughly US$22m).",
            "iv) Limit tax exemptions: In 2016, tax exemptions were a major source of lost tax revenue for the country (almost CFAF 2.4bn or roughly $4m). A significant share of these exemptions was granted to the private sector and related primarily to VAT. The adoption of the new investment charter in 2017 and the implementation of reforms aimed at curbing tax exemptions and improving the business environment to attract private investment require the firm commitment of the authorities and a formal legal system to institute legal proceedings in the event of abuse.",
            "v) Modernise the tax system: Strengthening tax administration capacity is critical to improving the tax system. This requires heavy investment in the computerisation of public administrations and the purchase of the equipment and software needed to improve revenue collection. Computerisation will help curb abuse and corruption, trace transactions related to taxes and duties, facilitate the sharing of information between tax and customs authorities, and enhance the efficiency of financial boards.

According to the Mozambique Economic Update (MEU), growth is expected to have fallen to 2.3% in 2019, from 3.3% in 2018, as lower coal production and the impact of the cyclones, particularly on agriculture, affected overall output. With economic output growing at a slower pace than the population (2.8%), this translates into a decline in the standards of living in a context where poverty has been further aggravated by the cyclones.",
            "The report also warns that Mozambique is entering a period of widening current account deficits as it heads towards the early stages of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) investment cycle. It enters this cycle with an improved external reserve position. But lacklustre non-extractive export performance, lower growth in key trading partners and commodity price movements continue to be important sources of external risk.",
            "The MEU presents a positive growth outlook provided a post-cyclone recovery in agriculture, easing in credit conditions and progress in LNG developments are materialised. But the report highlights the need for a renewed focus on structural reforms for more sustainable and inclusive growth, including progress in strengthening the business environment, increasing the supply of skilled labour to the economy, reducing corruption and improving connectivity. Building resilience to climate shocks is also increasingly critical given Mozambique\u2019s heightened exposure to such events.",
            "The report also notes that having made progress in consolidating public finances up to 2018, the costs of the cyclone response, the electoral cycle and a still growing civil service wage bill forced the departure from this trend in 2019. And although debt levels have declined since 2016, the debt burden is still elevated. Thus, the outlook points to a tight fiscal setting and requires near term measures to reduce the deficit whilst maintaining a persistent focus on improving expenditure efficiency. The MEU also acknowledges the significant progress made in strengthening fiscal management in recent years and calls for additional efforts to control growth in civil service remuneration and to restructure underperforming State-Owned Enterprises (SOE).",
            "The special focus section in this economic update calls on policy makers to be mindful of the growing rural investment gap. The report finds that overall, the gap has been growing between rural and urban areas, especially in the rural parts of Mozambique\u2019s central and northern provinces \u2013 which are the poorest. It also shows that Mozambique\u2019s public investment programme made limited progress in reducing access disparities during the 2008-2015 investment boom years.",
            "Lower investment levels in underserved areas contributed to increased gaps in access. Spending inefficiencies also played a role: the analysis notes that only 42% of the investment budget went to capital expenditure on basic infrastructure for service delivery between 2009 and 2015, with the remainder going towards non-capital outlays such as administrative and overhead costs. But since 2016, investment budget cuts helped improve the composition of investments as allocations to administrative spending fell.",
