        "abstract": "Background: Bovine orthopneumovirus, formerly known as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), is frequently associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Aim: To perform the molecular characterization of the G and F proteins of Brazilian wildtype BRSV strains derived from bovine respiratory infections in both beef and dairy cattle. Materials and Methods: Ten BRSV strains derived from a dairy heifer rearing unit (n 1\u20444 3) in 2011 and steers of three other feedlots (n 1\u20444 7) in 2014 and 2015 were analyzed. For the BRSV G and F partial gene amplifications, RT-nested-PCR assays were performed with sequencing in both directions with forward and reverse primers used. Results: The G gene-based analysis revealed that two strains were highly similar to the BRSV sequences representative of subgroup III, including the Bayovac vaccine strain. However, the remaining seven Brazilian BRSV strains were diverse when compared with strains representative of the BRSV I to VIII subgroups. The central hydrophobic region of the Brazilian BRSV G gene showed the replacement of conserved cysteines and other residues of importance to antibody reactivity. The deduced F gene amino acid sequences from the Brazilian BRSV strains showed changes that were absent in the representative sequences of the known subgroups. Viral isolation on the nasopharyngeal swab suspensions failed to isolate BRSV. Conclusion: Results suggest that these strains represent a putative new subgroup of BRSV with mutations observed in the immunodominant region of the G protein. However, further studies on these Brazilian BRSV strains should be performed to establish their pathogenic potential.\nARTICLE HISTORY  ",

            "In summary, Brazilian BRSV sequences from both F and G genes showed unique aa changes, including within the immunodominant region of the G protein.",
            "In conclusion, considering the genetic variability of BRSV, molecular and epidemiological studies are needed to assess the practical implications of this diversity regarding both the pathogenicity of virus strains and the immunoprophylactic aspects of infection. Changes in the BRSV G protein may even confer cross-protective immunity in animals infected with heterologous strains; however, some aspects such as the degree of protection, scope, and duration of immunity conferred by different subgroups are not yet fully known. The identification and characterization of genetically different BRSV subgroups circulating in beef and dairy cattle herds and further studies on their antigenic properties are critical to the adoption of effective strategies for the control and prophylaxis of BRD and to minimize economic losses. Only with the knowledge of classical and molecular epidemiology of BRSV in a region and/or in a country and the temporal distribution is it possible to implement and evaluate the efficiency of immunoprophylactic programs against BRSV infection in cattle herds around the world."

A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories [\u00feG, parameter 1\u20444 0.9582]). The analysis involved 102 nucleotide sequences. Bootstrap values higher than 60% are shown. Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying the Neighbor-joining and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach and then selecting the topology with a superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site.

Aim: To perform the molecular characterization of the G and F proteins of Brazilian wildtype BRSV strains derived from bovine respiratory infections in both beef and dairy cattle. Materials and Methods: Ten BRSV strains derived from a dairy heifer rearing unit (n 1\u20444 3) in 2011 and steers of three other feedlots (n 1\u20444 7) in 2014 and 2015 were analyzed. For the BRSV G and F partial gene amplifications, RT-nested-PCR assays were performed with sequencing in both directions with forward and reverse primers used. Results: The G gene-based analysis revealed that two strains were highly similar to the BRSV sequences representative of subgroup III, including the Bayovac vaccine strain. However, the remaining seven Brazilian BRSV strains were diverse when compared with strains representative of the BRSV I to VIII subgroups. The central hydrophobic region of the Brazilian BRSV G gene showed the replacement of conserved cysteines and other residues of importance to antibody reactivity. The deduced F gene amino acid sequences from the Brazilian BRSV strains showed changes that were absent in the representative sequences of the known subgroups.

This study aimed to molecularly characterize BRSV strains identified in BRD-affected dairy heifers and steers in feedlots. Brazilian BRSV sequences of both the F and G genes showed unique aa changes, including within the immunodominant region of the G protein. The exceptions were the strains UEL02-Me/2011 and 04-RP/2014, which were classified as belonging to subgroup III, with high similarity to the Bayovac vaccine strain. Since these strains are highly conserved, they will not be discussed in depth.<br/><br/>The partial F gene analysis showed slight differences among the Brazilian strains (as much as 2.4% higher and 1.3% higher at the nt and aa levels, respectively) and among the strains representative of each known subgroup (4.5% and 2.5% at the nt and aa levels, respectively). However, we could not perform in-depth analysis of the F gene in this study since the partial amplified sequences were not targeted to important domains of this gene, such as glycosylation sites and/or hydrophobic motifs. Although highly conserved, the detailed comparison of the sequences from the partial F gene of the BRSV strains in this study showed exclusive aa changes in relation to the prototype strains. Interestingly, the comparison of the BRSV strains with another previously described Brazilian strain revealed higher divergences (10.9% and 16.7% at the nt and aa levels, respectively). These results reveal the genetic diversity of the Brazilian BRSV strains, even from a conserved genomic region within the F gene of the virus."

Although cut-off values at both the nt and aa levels are not currently established and considering that the nt differences observed in the BRSV prototype strains among each other vary from 5% to 16% (Sarmiento-Silva et al 2012), it is highly likely that the Brazilian strains in this study represent a putative new subgroup of BRSV.

These findings suggest that there are different lineages of BRSV circulating in Parana state and even in a single herd at the same time.",
            "All Brazilian BRSV strains in this study showed aa changes within the ectodomain region of the G gene, including in the G-central conserved region between aas 158-189. We expected to find a conserved hydrophobic domain between residues 173186; however, substitutions of cysteines and other residues that have a great influence on immunological activity were observed. Additionally, the Brazilian BRSV strains lacked both the Asn179 and Leu183 residues, which were replaced by Lys and Ser, respectively. Cysteine residues are important factors for the intramolecular disulfide bond and steric structure of the protein. Cys173-Cys186 and Cys176\u2013Cys182 constitute the outer and inner disulfide bridges, respectively, while Asn179 is involved in three hydrogen bonds that link the two helices of the Cys176-disulfide bridge via backbone oxygen with the Leu183 amide in the second helix (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDoreleijers_et+al_1996_a\" href=\"#rDoreleijers_et+al_1996_a\">Doreleijers et al 1996</a>). In addition, although the cysteine noose was shown to be unnecessary for effective virus infection both in vitro and in vivo (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTeng_2002_a\" href=\"#rTeng_2002_a\">Teng and Collins 2002</a>), it was considered necessary for binding the virus to the cell (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAkerlind-Stopner_et+al_1990_a\" href=\"#rAkerlind-Stopner_et+al_1990_a\">Akerlind-Stopner et al 1990</a>, Valentova et al 2012). Therefore, it is likely that the lack of the three cysteines that were replaced by Leu, Tyr, and/or Arg and other residue mutations at positions 179 and 183 observed in the Brazilian BRSV strains in this study represent a loss of disulfide bridges and structural changes in the G protein.",
            "Conversely, the replacement of all Cys residues with Arg, resulting in changes in the structure of the central conserved region and the disturbance of the a helix Cys173-Cys176, was previously reported in BRSV strains isolated from diseased animals (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cValarcher_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rValarcher_et+al_2000_a\">Valarcher et al 2000</a>). This demonstrated that natural in vivo infections with mutants lacking the four cysteines involved in the two disulfide bridges are possible. In contrast to previous Brazilian studies (Baptista et al 2017, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHeadley_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rHeadley_et+al_2017_a\">Headley et al 2017</a>, 2018), the nasopharyngeal swabs from which these BRSV strains were obtained were negative for other respiratory tract pathogens, suggesting that these Brazilian BRSV strains might have induced the disease. Additionally, BRSV strains in this study were not isolated in cell culture, suggesting that these may be attenuated strains of the virus. Despite the disulfide bridge loss and structural changes in the G protein, it is likely that the pathogenic potential of these BRSV strains was not affected regardless of whether the strains were attenuated. Although studies have shown that the F protein alone is sufficient to mediate attachment and fusion in the absence of G protein (Valarcher et al 2007), further studies on these Brazilian BRSV strains should be performed to establish their pathogenic potential.",
            "In this regard, we presume that the potential pathogenic role of some of the Brazilian strains may also have been impacted by mutations at residue 171. A characteristic hydrophobic pocket was previously reported from this genomic region, lined only by the conserved residues Val171-Pro172, Cys173, Cys176 and Cys182, and Leu185-Cys186, suggesting that there may be a hydrophobic interaction between the conserved pocket and receptor site that is common to all RSV-G cell receptors (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDoreleijers_et+al_1996_a\" href=\"#rDoreleijers_et+al_1996_a\">Doreleijers et al 1996</a>). In this study, along with cysteines, three of the Brazilian BRSV strains were also found with substitutions of the residue Val171!Ala171, likely influencing the previously mentioned interaction.",
            "Furthermore, studies have reported that residues at positions 174-185 of the central conserved region are immunodominant, and one-point substitutions in this region, especially residues 180, 183, and 184, substantially influence the antibody reactivity of some BRSV strains (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFurze_et+al_1997_a\" href=\"#rFurze_et+al_1997_a\">Furze et al 1997</a>, Langedijk et al 1997). According to linear epitopes, the point mutations that determine BRSV subgroups are Leu180 for subgroups A and intermediate and Pro180, Ser183, and Pro184 for subgroup B (Langedijk et al 1997). Substitutions of these residues with Leu180!Pro180, Leu183!Ser183, and/or Ser184!Leu184 were found in the Brazilian BRSV strains in this study. Moreover, an additional mutation, Ala181!Thr181, was also observed in three of these strains. When combined, the expected motifs LACLS (subgroup A), PACSP (subgroup B), and LACSS (intermediate subgroup) at position 180-184 were replaced by different residue combinations, such as PACSL, PARSS, PACSS, PTRSS, and PARSS. Although the antigenic reactivity of the Brazilian BRSV strains in this study has not been analyzed, we presume that these strains present changes in antigenic epitopes that also may influence antibody reactivity and binding. Additional studies based on antigenic properties of these Brazilian BRSV strains should be performed to confirm these hypotheses.",
            "A feature of BRSV is its ability to infect a host even in the presence of virus-neutralizing antibodies and to induce reinfections throughout the life of a host (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cValentova_2012_a\" href=\"#rValentova_2012_a\">Valentova 2012</a>). Massive vaccination of herds or constant reinfection of animals that already have antibodies against BRSV, as reported in infections by HRSV, were assumed to be important immunologic pressure factors that lead to the expression of virus evolution (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMartinez_et+al_1997_a\" href=\"#rMartinez_et+al_1997_a\">Martinez et al 1997</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cProzzi_et+al_1997_a\" href=\"#rProzzi_et+al_1997_a\">Prozzi et al 1997</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cValarcher_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rValarcher_et+al_2000_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cValarcher_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rValarcher_et+al_2000_a\">Valarcher et al 2000</a></a>). In this study, the sampled Brazilian cattle herds were not subjected to any direct vaccine selective pressure, and the nt and aa sequences were obtained directly from biological samples of BRD-affected animals, representing wildtype Brazilian BRSV strains with no previous adaption and passages in cell culture. Although BRSV vaccination has been more widely used in Brazil, such vaccination prevents the disease but does not suppress virus circulation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cValarcher_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rValarcher_et+al_2000_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cValarcher_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rValarcher_et+al_2000_a\">Valarcher et al 2000</a></a>). Therefore, the possibility that an indirect vaccination pressure or constant BRSV reinfection has driven mutations in the BRSV strains analyzed in this study cannot be ruled out.",
            "In summary, Brazilian BRSV sequences from both F and G genes showed unique aa changes, including within the immunodominant region of the G protein.",
            "Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Brazilian BRSV strains grouped into distinct branches for both genes analyzed, revealing that these represent a putative new subgroup of BRSV. The mutations observed in the Brazilian BRSV strains suggest changes in the structure of the G protein. Considering that these BRSV strains were obtained from BRD-affected animals and based on i) the circulation of distinct lineages of BRSV strains in a single herd at the same time, ii) the changes in the immunodominant region of G protein, and iii) the negative results for the other respiratory tract pathogens, we presume that infection with related but distinct BRSV strains may favor immune evasion by the virus, establishment of infection, and eventually, disease induction, even if these strains are or are not attenuated strains.",
            "In conclusion, considering the genetic variability of BRSV, molecular and epidemiological studies are needed to assess the practical implications of this diversity regarding both the pathogenicity of virus strains and the immunoprophylactic aspects of infection. Changes in the BRSV G protein may even confer cross-protective immunity in animals infected with heterologous strains; however, some aspects such as the degree of protection, scope, and duration of immunity conferred by different subgroups are not yet fully known. The identification and characterization of genetically different BRSV subgroups circulating in beef and dairy cattle herds and further studies on their antigenic properties are critical to the adoption of effective strategies for the control and prophylaxis of BRD and to minimize economic losses. Only with the knowledge of classical and molecular epidemiology of BRSV in a region and/or in a country and the temporal distribution is it possible to implement and evaluate the efficiency of immunoprophylactic programs against BRSV infection in cattle herds around the world."
