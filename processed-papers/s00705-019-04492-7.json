        "abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) targets the intestinal mucosa in pigs. To protect against PEDV invasion, a mucosal vaccine is utilized effectively. In this study, we generated a recombinant adenovirus vaccine encoding the heat-labile enterotoxin B (LTB) and the core neutralizing epitope (COE) of PEDV (rAd-LTB-COE). The fusion protein LTB-COE was successfully expressed by the recombinant adenovirus in HEK293 cells, and the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate was assessed in BALB/c mice and piglets. Three intramuscular or oral vaccinations with rAd-LTB-COE at two-week intervals induced robust humoral and mucosal immune responses. Moreover, a cell-mediated immune response was promoted in immunized mice, and the neutralizing antibody inhibited both the vaccine strain and the emerging PEDV isolate. Immunization experiments in piglets revealed that rAd-LTB-COE was immunogenic and induced good immune responses in piglets. Further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of rAd-LTB-COE against a highly virulent PEDV challenge.",

            "The first reported outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) was in England in 1971. PED is characterized by acute enteritis, watery diarrhea, weight loss, dehydration, and high mortality in neonatal piglets [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Since PED virus (PEDV) was first identified in Belgium in 1976, it has spread widely to many Asian countries, including Japan, China, South Korea, and Thailand [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], and also to North America [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].<br/><br/>PEDV is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. The genome contains<br/><br/>Handling Editor: Sheela Ramamoorthy.<br/><br/>two large open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, encoding replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. Four other ORFs encode a spike protein, an envelope protein, a membrane protein, and a nucleocapsid protein, and ORF3 is an accessory gene.

Human adenovirus type 5 was used to express the full-length S gene of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), and neutralizing antibodies were produced that partially protected against a PRCV challenge [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>].",
            "LTB has been used as an adjuvant for vaccines to support host immune responses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. Hashigucci et al showed that higher hemagglutination inhibition and sIgA antibody titers could be observed in the respiratory tract of volunteers who were immunized with a combination of the inactivated influenza virus and LTB than in people immunized with the inactivated influenza vaccine alone [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Ge et al generated Lactobacillus casei (Lc) expressing COE or LTB-COE and immunized mice orogastrically. LcCOE or Lc-LTB-COE immunization resulted in the production of IgG and sIgA and could neutralize PEDV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. To our knowledge, the immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus containing both LTB and PEDV protein has not been reported. Therefore, we generated a recombinant adenovirus carrying the LTB and PEDV COE (amino acids 490\u2013790) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The LTB-COE fusion protein (63",
            "SM98 (a) and HID9051 (b) at 35 and 42 dpi. Bars represent the mean \u00b1 SE in each group. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001",
            "Next, we evaluated the immunogenicity of the rAd-LTBCOE candidate vaccine (intramuscular and oral immunization) in BALB/c mice. Interestingly, our vaccine strategy showed a significant increase in antigen-specific antibody levels. The rAd-LTB-COE vaccine elicited a robust humoral immune response at 14 dpi, and high antibody levels were maintained throughout the experiment. In a previous study, Tuboly et al constructed a recombinant adenovirus type 5 carrying the full-length S gene of TGEV, which induced high levels of antigen-specific IgG in the sera of immunized pigs with a mean of 7 l\u00adog2 at 21 dpi [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Higher titers of specific IgG with a mean of 8 l\u00adog2 in sera of mice immunized with rAd-LTB-COE at 42 dpi were observed in this study. Furthermore, rAd-LTB-COE induced significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 in immunized mice at 28, 35, and 42 dpi than were found in the K vaccine group. In a study by Wang et al, mice were orally immunized with Lc expressing a fused protein of a dendritic-cell-targeting peptide and COE that induced up to 1.7 pg of IFN-\u03b3 per ml [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. Our candidate vaccine induced significantly higher amounts of IFN-\u03b3 (~ 100 pg/ml) in the supernatant of splenocyte cultures.",
            "Therefore, our vaccine strategy is successful in inducing both humoral and cellular immunity against PEDV.",
            "Some researchers have tried to enhance the mucosal immunity and produce protective mucosal antibodies against PEDV, but effective vaccines have not been commercialized yet. Ideal mucosal vaccines against PEDV need to be designed to promote both mucosal and systemic immunity. Primary protection is achieved through sIgA antibodies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. sIgA is more resistant to the proteolysis in the intestinal tract and neutralizes PEDV infections better than IgG or IgM [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. In this study, rAd-LTB-COE induced significant titers of specific sIgA in the feces of immunized mice. The levels of specific sIgA in the feces of mice intramuscularly or orally immunized with rAd-LTB-COE were significantly higher than those in the K vaccine group. Our results are consistent with a previous study in which a fusion protein of LTB and COE could induce high levels of specific sIgA in the mucosal tract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. In addition, the rAd-LTB-COE oral group showed higher sIgA titers than the intramuscular group, which could be explained by enhanced mucosal immunity in the oral cavity and the digestive tract, as described by Song et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. These results suggest that the recombinant adenovirus expressing the LTB-COE fused protein is a novel vaccine strategy for protection against PEDV.",
            "Neutralizing antibodies critically protect against viral infections, but the cross-protection of current PEDV vaccines against new field viruses has been shown to be weak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Sows immunized twice with a DR13-based vaccine produced neutralizing antibody titers in the sera with means of 5 l\u00adog2 against homologous PEDV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. Immunization with Lc expressing a fused protein of a dendriticcell-targeting peptide and COE in BALB/c mice could raise neutralizing antibody titers against PEDV to a mean of 4.6 \u00adlog2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. A study by Lin et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] showed that commercial vaccines based on the PEDV strain CV777 or DR13 failed to protect piglets against challenge with a field strain. In our study, neutralizing antibodies induced by rAd-LTB-COE in BALB/c mice neutralized both the PEDV genogroup I SM98 and the emerging genogroup II HID9051, with mean titers of 5 l\u00adog2 and 3.6 l\u00adog2, respectively. This indicates that the neutralizing epitope sequence (amino acids 490\u2013790) of the S protein and high levels of the anti-S antibodies provide better protection against PEDV infection. In summary, rAd-LTBCOE induces strong humoral, mucosal, and cell-mediated immune responses in BALB/c mice.",
            "To determine how rAd-LTB-COE induces immune responses in piglets, we vaccinated piglets twice with the candidate vaccine or the H vaccine. The results showed that rAd-LTB-COE could induce humoral as well as cellmediated immune responses in piglets. rAd-LTB-COE vaccination also produced higher titers of IgA in the serum than the H vaccine. Furthermore, rAd-LTB-COE induced the production of neutralizing antibodies against PEDV SM98 and HID9051 at levels similar to those induced by the H vaccine. This could be explained by the similarity in the amino acid sequences of their S proteins, which play a critical role in the production of neutralizing antibodies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. These results illustrate that rAd-LTB-COE has good immunogenicity not only in BALB/c mice but also in piglets. Further studies in neonatal piglets farrowed from the sows vaccinated with rAd-LTB-COE are needed to assess the effect of maternal immunity and to evaluate the protection against PEDV infection in challenge experiments.",
            "To our knowledge, this is the first study on the immunogenicity of the recombinant adenovirus expressing the fusion protein LTB-COE. Our results indicate that rAdLTB-COE can be used as a novel mucosal vaccine and is a strong candidate for the next generation of PED vaccination strategies that will generate broad-range protection against multiple PEDV strains."
