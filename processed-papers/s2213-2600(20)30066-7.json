A patient who travelled from Shanghai to attend a meeting in Germany was subclinical until on the flight back to China. However, two of this patient\u2019s close contacts and another two patients attending the meeting without close contact were found to be infected with COVID-19.5 This recent case shows that not only can subclinical patients transmit the virus effectively but patients can also shed high amounts of the virus and infect others even after recovery from the acute illness. These findings warrant aggressive measures (such as N95 masks, goggles, and protective gowns) to ensure the safety of healthcare workers during this COVID-19 outbreak, as well as future outbreaks, especially in the initial stages where limited information about the transmission and infective potency of the virus is available.",
