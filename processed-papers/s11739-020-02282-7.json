        "abstract": "Although bacteria are a primary cause of CAP, more than 100 microbes including atypical bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, can also cause CAP. The true prevalence of the various etiologic agents remains uncertain, varying from region to region and depending on the laboratory diagnostic capability. CAP epidemiology is changing as a consequence of the widespread introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal vaccines, and the growing role of viruses as cause of CAP is currently a matter of debate [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Since neither clinical nor radiological characteristics allow a precise diagnosis, differentiating viral from bacterial pneumonia is challenging and relies upon diagnostic microbiology [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
