        "abstract": "Introduction. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. Therefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. The nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. Methods. It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. Results. Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. These confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD\u2009\u00b1\u200922.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. The study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. Conclusion. The study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of Saudi Arabia as well and explore potential preventable risk factors.",

            "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was first recognized in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia. e clinical presentations of MERS and non-MERS SARI are often similar. erefore, the identification of suspected cases that may have higher chances of being diagnosed as cases of MERS-CoV is essential. However, the real challenge is to flag these patients through some demographic markers. e nature of these markers has not previously been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and hence, this study aims to identify them. Methods. It was a surveillance system-based study, for which data from a total of 23,646 suspected patients in Riyadh and Al Qassim regions were analyzed from January 2017 until December 2017 to estimate the prevalence of MERS-CoV among suspected cases and to determine potential demographic risk factors related to the confirmation of the diagnosis. Results. Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. ese confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD \u00b1 22.8). Around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. e study identified three significant and independent predictors for confirmation of the disease: an age between 41 and 60 years, male gender, and summer season admission. Conclusion. e study provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in the subject regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for the prevention and management of such a contagious disease. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions of Saudi Arabia as well and explore potential preventable risk factors.",

Very limited evidence is available for exploring the epidemiology of this virus among the pediatric population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. e literature shows that MERS-CoV infects males more than females [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. e casefatality rate of men (52%) is higher than that of women (23%) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Males with a history of serious medical conditions are highly susceptible to this infection. Moreover, the mean age of infection in adults is 60 years [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",
            "e mode of transmission is not entirely understood yet [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]; however, human-to-human [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] and zoonotic sources of transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] have been documented in many studies. Dromedary camels are the major animal source of MERSCoV transmission to humans. Interhuman transmission of the virus did not occur easily, but it is seen mainly in patients\u2019 families and healthcare settings [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Clinical pictures of this infection varied from asymptomatic to mild respiratory symptoms to severe respiratory distress and death [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Severe ailment can often cause respiratory catastrophes that need mechanical ventilation and support in ICUs across different healthcare settings [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].

At present, no vaccine exists for preventing the infections of MERS-CoV. e CDC indicated that preventative actions should be taken for any type of respiratory illness [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Such actions include washing hands with water and soap for around 20 seconds or using hand sanitizers with alcohol if no water is available. One must cover their nose and mouth during instances of sneezing and coughing with a tissue and avoid touching the mouth, nose, or eyes with their hands until washed properly. Repeatedly touched surfaces, such as door knobs, should be disinfected and cleaned regularly. Intimate personal contact, e.g., kissing, and sharing cups or eating utensils must also be avoided [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "Many studies have been conducted in recent years in Saudi Arabia to combat this deadly disease. A large multicentre study showed that it is nearly impossible to differentiate between patients of MERS-CoV and non-MERSCoV just on the basis of clinical presentation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Another cohort study, which was hospital-based (17 cases vs. 82 controls), found that there were statistically significant differences in terms of gender, clinical, and radiographic presentations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Similarly, two more single-centre case control studies reported that the presenting symptoms of MERS-CoV infection were not specific [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].",

Mild symptomatic cases, which result in a positive PCR, may be isolated at home. Severe to moderate cases should be admitted to and isolated in a hospital until they improve and then be discharged for isolation at home for an extended period.

            "3.2. Demographics of Confirmed Cases. Of 119 confirmed cases of the MERS-CoV, the male-female ratio was approximately 2 : 1 (67% male and 33% female). e highest prevalence of MERS-CoV infected cases (41.2%) was seen in the age group 41\u201360 years, and most of the confirmed cases were recorded during summer. e majority consisted of non-healthcare workers (74.8%), and most were Saudi nationals (54.6%). Around 25.2% of such cases eventually died due to MERS-CoV. Table 3 shows the sample characteristics of confirmed cases.",

A total of 23,646 suspected cases were included in the results. Of the total suspected cases, 119 cases had been confirmed via laboratory results. All the confirmed cases are reported to MOH through HESN (health electronic surveillance networks) and to the World Health Organization (WHO) through the International Health Regulations (IHR), National Focal Point of Saudi Arabia. We found that MERSCoV infection was found significantly in people aged between 41 and 60 years and was reported most commonly during the summer season. e odds of infection among males were found to be twice as high as that of females with suspected cases.",
            "During the study period, i.e., the year 2017, only 119 confirmed cases were reported, which means that the number of MERS-CoV infection cases has decreased in Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions in comparison to that of the last three years. From 2015 to 2016, there was a 25.4% decrease, whereas from 2016 to 2017, it decreased by 48.7%, which translates into a 50% decrease between the two periods. is also complements the findings reported by of Da\u2019ar and Ahmed in their paper [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. e predominance of infection in males was also observed in another study pwefromed in KSA (2015), which reported the percentage of confirmed cases among males to be 66%, compared with 34% among females [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>].",
            "It is worth mentioning that Saudi Arabia defines age categories differently from the WHO (children: 0\u201314, adult: otherwise) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. However, unlike the classification used in Saudi Arabia, we have followed the WHO categorization of age to differentiate between children/adolescents (0 to 19 years) and adults (20 years and older) as indicated in WHO reports for age-standardized population and in infectious diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. is categorization was also followed by Aly and his collaborators in their recent paper published in 2017 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Adults were further subcategorized into three groups according to the age distribution of the study population using the following two cutoff points (age of 41 and age of 60) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "ese data agreed with a previous surveillance study, which stated that the majority of confirmed cases of MERSCoV were reported among people aged 40 and above [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. In 2016, only 9 of 552 cases (1.6%) of MERS-CoV infection were found among pediatric patients. Moreover, the study which was conducted in King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh (KFMC) between January 2012 and December 2013 did not report any MERS-CoV cases among children [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. e study which was conducted across the Gulf countries for four years by Mahmoud Aly et al between 2012 and 2016 suggests that the prevalence and distribution of MERS-CoV were the highest-risk in elderly aged 60 years or above [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Similar to our results, this study also reported the highest number of confirmed cases during the summer season [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "Among confirmed cases, only 25.2% were healthcare workers, whereas around 75% were non-healthcare workers.",
            "is is in agreement with the study done by Ahmad to estimate the survival rate in MERS-CoV globally prior to 26 January 2017; 86.9% were not health-care workers compared with 13.1% confirmed cases of healthcare workers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Similarly, other studies also reported a lower prevalence in healthcare workers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>].",
            "Our data reported a higher prevalence of infection among Saudi nationals as compared with non-Saudi. Another study also showed similar results but with a much higher percentage among Saudis, which may be due to the fact that it included Saudis from all regions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. ere is no finding basis for comparison as such, because our study was focused on the Riyadh and Al Qassim regions only.",
            "In our study, we detected a low prevalence (0.5%). e low positive predictive value of our lab results is not related to the low sensitivity and specificity of the lab assay. e estimated analytical sensitivity and specificity of the Real Star kit from Altona was reported to be 100% with no cross reactivity with other respiratory pathogens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Moreover, this low predictive value in the lab results is related to the high burden of false positive cases referred to the lab. In fact, this research is just the starting point to shed the light on more factors that might help in putting more descriptive criteria to lower the financial and human resources burden.",
            "To the best of our knowledge, no one has developed a logistic regression that focuses on demographic risk factors such as sex, age, and seasons prior to our study. However, it is worth mentioning that Ahmed et al developed a risk prediction model that encompasses risk factors such as chest pain, leukopenia, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. However, further investigations are needed to confirm our findings.",
            "One of the major strengths of our study is that it is a comprehensive regional study which included all the suspected cases of MERS-CoV in the Riyadh and Al-Qassim regions. Secondly, the external validity of our study is also expected to be high, as it covers the two regions completely, meaning that the records of all suspected cases in these two main regions in Saudi Arabia were included. irdly, the quality of the data is considered to be high, given that the contagious and life-threatening nature of this disease has led to strict obedience to rules which are enforced in a timely manner, thus ensuring accurate reporting of suspected cases. In addition to this, quality assurance policies are implemented at HESN in order to maintain the highest level of validity and reliability of the data collection process. e variables available for suspected cases were limited to demographics, which limited the scope of our research, but they provided valuable information to form a basis for future studies of a broader scope. Variables such as primary/secondary infections are vital pieces of information, but due the limitation of the data available, we could not determine their effects.",
            "According to our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that have specifically investigated MERS-CoV risk factors in the Riyadh and Al-Qassim areas (two major regions in KSA). Given that all suspected and confirmed cases were included in this study, we assume that our results are generalizable for both the regions with confidence. It must be noted that the comparative group of this study is different from that of the previous ones, as we compared those with confirmed MERS-CoV with those with suspected MERSCoV who have passed all stages of screening at the hospital, whereas other studies were hospital but not lab-based with an aim of identifying factors that help in suspecting rather than confirming cases. is might be the reason why we have found some significant demographic factors unlike other reports."
        ],
        "5. Conclusion": [
            "In conclusion, this research is about predictors for the confirmation of diagnosis among suspected cases only, meaning that the factors we found can help in identifying suspected cases that may have a higher chance of testing positive. is will help primary healthcare professionals to develop a better screening tool for suspected cases, as currently only a small minority of suspected cases are confirmed positive via lab results, consequently resulting in a lot of resources being spent to test thousands of samples, just for the identification of a few cases. e three factors we identified are important because, for example, a female, aged 18, presenting in winter will be less likely to be diagnosed than a male, aged 45, presenting in the summer, or, to give another example, a 60-year-old male who is presenting MERS-CoV signs with a negative lab result may need retesting.",
            "Our study covered two main regions in Saudi Arabia and provides evidence that the MERS-CoV epidemic in these two regions has specific characteristics that might help future plans for prevention and management of such contagious diseases. Our results showed that only a minority of suspected cases are actually diagnosed with the disease, meaning that the procedures being implemented seemed to be highly sensitive but not highly specific. e majority of confirmed cases were male, aged 41 to 60 years, and presented to healthcare facilities in the summer. Future studies should aim to confirm such findings in other regions in Saudi Arabia, to explore potential preventable risk factors and go deeper to know the underlying factors that make male aged 41\u201360 more susceptible than others.",
