The number of people diagnosed with the virus has shown a sharp rise. On January 30, 2020, China reported a total of 7,736 confirmed cases, 170 deaths, 9,267 suspected cases, and 124 discharged patients. Chinese health authorities did an immediate investigation to characterize and control the disease, including isolation of people suspected to have the disease, close monitoring of contacts, epidemiological and clinical data collection from patients, and development of diagnostic and treatment procedures. By January 7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus (nCoV) from patients in Wuhan.
