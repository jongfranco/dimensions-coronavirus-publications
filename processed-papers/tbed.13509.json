            "At the end of December 2019, local health officials in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province reported a cluster of 27 cases of \u2018pneumonia of unknown cause\u2019. The clinical symptoms of cases included fever, headache, difficulty breathing and pneumonia, with lung invasive lesions on chest radiography (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2020_a\">Wang, Horby, Hayden, & Gao, 2020</a>). In an initial case series of patients admitted to hospital in Wuhan, 6 of 41 (15%) died (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2020_a\">Huang et al, 2020</a>). Reported cases were epidemiologically linked to a wholesale seafood and animal market in the city. In January, the first death was reported, and the aetiology was identified as a new coronavirus, \u20182019-nCoV\u2019 (also called \u2018Wuhan coronavirus\u2019). It has been retrospectively concluded that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission as early as mid-December (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2020_a\">Li et al, 2020</a></a></a></a></a>), and based on modelling studies, it has been estimated that 75,815 individuals (95% credible interval 37,304\u2013130,330) had already been infected in Wuhan as of 25 January (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2020_a\">Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020</a>).",
