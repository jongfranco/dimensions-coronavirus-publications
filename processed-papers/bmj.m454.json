            "On the day the strike started, the government announced further closures of border crossings, leaving only Hong Kong International Airport, the Shenzhen Bay joint checkpoint, and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge open for passengers arriving by land or sea. By funnelling all traffic through two points as well as the airport, the inconvenience would deter many travellers, Lam said at a press conference. \u201cWe can also concentrate the staff [and] release about 1000 civil servants from the other control points . . . so they can do much better medical surveillance,\u201d she said.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]",

Moreover, not all cases are symptomatic during the incubation period and are undetectable with surveillance measures such as temperature checks.",
            "\u201cA semi-blockage is just as good as none,\u201d Yu said. \u201cIn fact, the last time Carrie Lam closed a few of the control points, the passenger flow from mainland China to Hong Kong only slightly decreased. Her measures are not going to stop the disease from being introduced to Hong Kong.\u201d",
            "A survey conducted by the Public Opinion Research Institute released on 31 January found that 61% of respondents backed the healthcare workers\u2019 strike.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]",
            "\u201cAlso, the amount of support shown on our Facebook page and email is tremendous,\u201d said Yu. \u201cWe even received messages from patients who told us that their medical care could be affected by our strike, yet they are still in full support of our actions. So yes, I do believe we have the support of Hong Kong citizens.\u201d",
