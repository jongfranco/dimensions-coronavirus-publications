The volume is written as a scholarly text to demonstrate that women compete successfully in the field, dating back to 1873. Each authors\u2019 chapter includes a section on her contribution to the field and a biography written for a general audience. This volume also includes a significant representation of early women\u2019s contributions, highlighting their rich history in the profession. The book covers topics such as drinking water and health, biologically-active compounds, wastewater management, and biofilms. This volume should be of interest to academics, researchers, consulting engineering offices, and engineering societies while also inspiring young women to persist in STEM studies and aspire to academic careers."
