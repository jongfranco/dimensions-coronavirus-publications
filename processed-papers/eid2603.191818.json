In their article, the authors note their assessed risk as \u201c4 to 7\u201d times higher than our risk estimate and suggest this relates to differences in case-finding methodology. Our study reported incidence density (cases per 10,000 person-years) to account for the differing lengths of postoperative follow-up in each successive annual cohort of surgical patients. In contrast, Sommerstein et al. calculated crude risk based on annual procedure numbers. Since our published assessment was undertaken some years before the authors\u2019 assessment, additional cases have been diagnosed, in keeping with the long incubation period for these infections, a median of 15 months but up to 5 years (3). Recalculation of risk and 95% (binomial) CIs, limited to 2008\u20132014 to match the authors\u2019 assessment, would yield a crude risk estimate of 0.24 (0.15\u20130.35) per 1,000 procedures (24/102,234); the risk in Switzerland (11/14,054) would be estimated at 0.78 (0.39\u20131.40), just over 3 times higher.",

            "Whether the observed differences between the United Kingdom and Switzerland represent a true difference in M. chimaera risk in patients undergoing heart valve surgery is subject to debate. Both countries based case finding on results from routine diagnostic investigation; however, awareness of the risk in Switzerland predates that in other countries, potentially increasing the likelihood of investigation for mycobacterial infection. We have observed considerable variation in risk between cardiac centers, from 0 cases rising to 1 per 100 patients for 1 center in their year of highest estimated risk (4). Our pooled estimate covering 33 centers may encompass a wider selection of risk profiles, compared with the smaller number of centers in Switzerland."

            "Seeing a several-centimeters-long worm traversing the conjunctiva of an eye is often the moment when many people realize they are infected with Loa loa, commonly called the African eyeworm, a parasitic nematode that migrates throughout the subcutaneous and connective tissues of infected persons. Infection with this worm is called loiasis and is typically diagnosed either by the worm\u2019s appearance in the eye or by a history of localized Calabar swellings, named for the coastal Nigerian town where that symptom was initially observed among infected persons. Endemic to a large region of the western and central African rainforests, the Loa loa microfilariae are passed to humans primarily from bites by flies from two species of the genus Chrysops, C. silacea and C. dimidiate. The more than 29 million people who live in affected areas of Central and West Africa are potentially at risk of loiasis.",

(1) for including additional cases from the period of 2008\u20132014 and for recalculating the UK cumulative incidence risk by matching our assessment. We agree that the observed 3 times higher risk in Switzerland of Mycobacterium chimaera infection for a patient undergoing heart valve surgery cannot be explained unambiguously. The most likely explanation is indeed increased awareness of the risk in Switzerland compared with other countries, potentially improving likelihood of investigation for mycobacterial infection. We think that the early formation of a national and interdisciplinary working group (M. chimaera Task Force), which included representatives of the involved (para-)medical disciplines, authorities, and professional associations, has contributed greatly to raising this awareness.",
