Current evidence confirms the role of dromedaries in primary human infections but does not explain the sporadic community cases.

Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1\u20130.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays.

Seropositivity of individuals from different nationalities underscores the potential MERS exportation outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warranted."
