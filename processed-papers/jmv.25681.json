        "abstract": "The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV), which is causing an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in patients in Wuhan, a central city in China, is another warning of the risk of CoVs posed to public health. In this minireview, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of CoVs and describe diseases caused by different CoVs in humans and animals. This review will help understand the biology and potential risk of CoVs that exist in richness in wildlife such as bats.",

            "nCoV). The sporadic emergence and outbreaks of new types of CoVs remind us that CoVs are a severe global health threat. It is highly likely that new CoV outbreaks are unavoidable in the future due to changes of the climate and ecology, and the increased interactions of human with animals. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies and vaccines against CoVs.",
            "CoVs belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, and this subfamily includes four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Figure 1A). The genome of CoVs is a single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA (+ssRNA) (~30 kb) with 5\u2032\u2010cap structure and 3\u2032\u2010poly\u2010A tail. The genomic RNA is used as template to directly translate polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab), which encodes nonstructural proteins (nsps) to form the replication\u2010transcription complex",

            "The genome and subgenomes of a typical CoV contain at least six ORFs. The first ORFs (ORF1a/b), about two\u2010thirds of the whole genome length, encode 16 nsps (nsp1\u201016), except Gammacoronavirus that lacks nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. There is a \u22121 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b, leading to production of two polypeptides: pp1a and pp1ab. These polypeptides are processed by virally encoded chymotrypsin\u2010like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro) and one or two papain\u2010like protease into 16 nsps.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Other ORFs on the one\u2010third of the genome near the 3\u2032\u2010 terminus encodes at least four main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Besides these four main structural proteins, different CoVs encode special structural and accessory proteins, such as HE protein, 3a/b protein, and 4a/b protein (Figure 1B, lower panel). All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]",
            "The genome sequence alignment of CoVs shows 58% identity on the nsp\u2010coding region and 43% identity on the structural protein\u2010coding region among different CoVs, with 54% at the whole genome level (Figure 1B, upper panel), suggesting the nsps are more conserved and the structural proteins are more diverse in need of adaptation to new hosts. Since the mutation rates in the replication of RNA viruses are much higher than that of DNA viruses, the genomes of RNA viruses are usually less than 10 kb in length. However, the CoV genome is much larger, with roughly 30 kb in length, the largest known RNA viruses. The maintenance of such a large genome of CoVs may be related to the special features of the CoV RTC, which contains several RNA processing enzymes such as the 3\u2032\u20105\u2032 exoribonuclease of nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The 3\u2032\u20105\u2032 exoribonuclease is unique to CoVs among all RNA viruses, probably providing a proofreading function of the RTC.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Sequence analysis shows that the 2019\u2010nCoV possesses a typical genome structure of CoV and belongs to the cluster of betacoronaviruses that includes Bat\u2010 SARS\u2010like (SL)\u2010ZC45, Bat\u2010SL ZXC21, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV. Based on the phylogenetic tree of CoVs, 2019\u2010nCoV is more closely related to bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV ZC45 and bat\u2010SL\u2010CoV ZXC21 and more distantly related to SARS\u2010CoV (Figure 1A).",

Up to 20 January 2020, 291 cases in total have been confirmed in China by sequence analysis, clinical diagnosis and epidemiological examination, including 270 cases in Wuhan and 21 cases in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yjb/new_index.shtml). In addition, four cases were confirmed in three other countries, including two cases in Thailand, one case in Japan, and one case in South Korea; all these patients had stayed in or visited Wuhan 2 weeks before the onset of the symptoms. Six deaths and 63 patients with severe symptoms were reported in Wuhan (http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/). Among the six death cases, four patients with published information are elder people of over 60 years old and have other illnesses before the infection, such as abdominal tumor and chronic liver disease, myocarditis and renal dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease.",

However, transmission of 2019\u2010nCoV from fish to human is unlikely. The 2019\u2010nCoV and fish CoVs such as Beluga Whale CoV/SW1 belong to different genera and apparently have different host ranges. As the Wuhan seafood market also sells other animals, the natural host of 2019\u2010 nCoV awaits to be identified. Due to the possibility of transmission from animal to human, CoVs in livestock and other animals including bats and wild animals sold in the market should be constantly monitored. In addition, more and more evidence indicate the new virus 2019\u2010nCoV is spread via the route of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission because there are infections of people who did not visit Wuhan but had close contact with family members who had visited Wuhan and got infected (http://www.cctv.com/).",
