        "abstract": "The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 24,500 confirmed cases, including 492 deaths, as of 5 February 2020. The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]). However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.012 (credible interval [0, 0.099]). This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a global pandemic.",

We fit an exponential distribution to these data, accounting for uncertainty due to the limited numbers of patients from whom data were available. Assuming that this distribution characterises the time spent by infected hosts generating new transmissions in the community, it is then possible to infer the probability that a case arriving in a new location is followed by an outbreak driven by sustained human-to-human transmission. We estimate this probability under the assumption that the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and then go on to consider the effect of shortening the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation.

In this branching process, the effective reproduction number (accounting for control interventions, other than intensified surveillance which we model explicitly) of the 2019-nCoV when the virus arrives in a new location is denoted by R = \u03b2/\u03b3, where the parameter \u03b2 represents pathogen transmissibility [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. We assumed that the transmissibility of the virus is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, i.e., \u03b2 = RSARS\u03b3SARS, where RSARS = 3 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] and the mean infection duration for SARS is 1/\u03b3SARS = 3.8 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. However, we adjusted the infectious period to account for the data describing the times between symptom onset and hospitalisation in the current outbreak.

            "There are concerns that the ongoing outbreak driven by the 2019-nCoV could spread globally [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] with sustained transmission in countries around the world. Periods of high travel rates, such as the recent Chinese New Year holiday, present a significant challenge since they pose an elevated risk of importations of the virus to new locations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In an effort to prevent a surge in travel, the Chinese government extended the national New Year holiday in January 2020.",
            "Here, we have estimated the potential for cases arriving in new locations to lead to sustained transmission. According to the basic model that we have constructed, if surveillance levels are similar to those in China at the beginning of the current outbreak, and if this virus is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus that spread globally in 2002\u20132003, then the probability that each imported infected case generates an outbreak due to sustained transmission is approximately 0.41 (CrI [0.27, 0.55]; Figure 1C). However, under a higher level of surveillance, the risk of sustained outbreaks is substantially lower (Figure 1D). This result is particularly striking when multiple independent cases travel to a new location, either simultaneously or in sequence (Figure 2). In that scenario, intensified surveillance is particularly important.",
            "Our study involves the simplest possible model that permits the risk of sustained transmission to be estimated from the very limited data that have been collected in this outbreak until now. As additional information becomes available, it will be possible to estimate the risk of outbreaks in new locations with more precision. We made the assumption that symptom appearance coincides with the onset of infectiousness. One of the features of the SARS outbreak in 2002\u20132003 that allowed it to eventually be brought under control was the low proportion of onward transmissions occurring either prior to symptoms or from asymptomatic infectious hosts [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. It might be hoped that infections due to the 2019-nCoV share this characteristic. Some reports have suggested that this may not be the case, although the extent of presymptomatic transmission is disputed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. We are working on an updated version of our analyses that includes the possibility of transmission from presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic hosts (based on the \u201cSEAIR\u201d compartmental model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]).",
            "Since our results were obtained using patient data from early in the ongoing outbreak, surveillance systems may not have been fully established when these data were collected, and patients may not have been primed to respond quickly to early symptoms. Our results might therefore be viewed as an upper bound on the risk posed by the 2019-nCoV. As the outbreak continues, it might be expected that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation or isolation will decrease, leading to lower risks of sustained transmission, as has been observed for outbreaks of other diseases (e.g., the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Initial indications suggest that such a decrease is occurring in China for this outbreak. In contrast, there may be some individuals that developed symptoms, but had not yet reported their infection by the time our analysis was conducted. \u201cRight censoring\u201d in this way favours lower reporting times, and so falsely reduces estimates of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>].",
            "Going forwards, it will be possible to include additional realism in the model. One example might be to consider spatial variation in host population densities and surveillance levels, leading to spatially inhomogeneous outbreak risks. Another possibility might be to account more explicitly for heterogeneities between different infectors, either by incorporating \u201csuperspreaders\u201d [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] in the model or by differentiating between individuals that report disease at different rates. Such heterogeneity might be expected to reduce the risk of sustained transmission (for a preliminary analysis, in which individuals can either be \u201cfast reporters\u201d or \u201cslow reporters\u201d, see the Supplementary Text). It would also be possible to differentiate between mild and severe cases in the model. On the one hand, a mild case might be more likely to go unnoticed than a severe case, potentially leading to a higher outbreak risk. On the other hand, mild infections may generate fewer secondary cases than severe infections, thereby decreasing the outbreak risk. Complex interactions may therefore affect the risk of sustained transmission in an unpredictable fashion.",
            "Despite the necessary simplifications made in this study, our analyses are sufficient to demonstrate the key principle that rigorous surveillance is important to minimise the risk of the 2019-nCoV generating large outbreaks in countries worldwide. We therefore support the ongoing work of the World Health Organization and policy makers from around the world, who are working with researchers and public health experts to manage this outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. We also appreciate efforts to make data publicly available [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Careful analysis of the outbreak, as well as minimisation of transmission risk as much as possible, is of clear public health importance."
