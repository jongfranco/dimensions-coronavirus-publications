Data on domestic cases in this report were collected from National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and state and territory case investigation reports. The Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) developed the case definition for suspected and confirmed cases, which was modified at different time points in the epidemic (23 January and 27 January 2020) (Table 3). CDNA developed national guidance on investigating suspected and confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV. Based on this guidance, state and territory health department investigators conhealth.gov.au/cdi ducted interviews of suspected cases to collect core and enhanced data for inclusion in NNDSS. Data were analysed using Stata to describe the epidemiology of infections in Australia and the progress of the epidemic."
