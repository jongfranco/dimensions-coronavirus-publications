            "The quality of training we received abroad gave us the confidence and expertise to work with leading scientists on COVID-19.\u201d",
            "Nnaemeka Ndodo is chief molecular bioengineer at the National Reference Laboratory for Nigeria\u2019s Centre for Disease Control in Abuja. nnaemeka.ndodo@ ncdc.gov.ng of these immigrants were Nigerian.

The United Nations estimated that some 1.24 million people made up the Nigerian diaspora in 2017, with the United States attracting the vast majority of emigrants, and numbers were growing.",
            "These people have boosted prosperity in the countries that received them. Nigerians form one of the most educated immigrant communities in the United States and paid more than U$4 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2018. They are an asset, not a liability. Whatever the rationale for the baffling expansions to the ban, the consensus is that it will disconnect Nigerians in the United States from their families and make for a more hostile environment.",
            "Even without such moves, travelling can be difficult. Just the sight of my country\u2019s green passport can bring excessive scrutiny. On my very first international trip, airport officials in a major European city searched my luggage. When they found an anatomy book, they decided I must be concealing drugs in my body. So they forced me to sign a document at gunpoint, took me from the airport without a coat (I had never experienced such cold) and performed X-rays (another first) that found no contraband. When I demanded an apology, they said I should blame my maltreatment on compatriots selling narcotics. I was ready to return to Nigeria immediately to avoid future ill treatment. I am glad now that a colleague convinced me otherwise, and I continued my journey to train in molecular bioengineering.",
            "Already, many young Nigerian scientists wishing to study in the United States are repeatedly denied the sorts of training opportunity that I had, their visas being turned down for one reason after another. This is so short-sighted: if a new human or crop pathogen arises here, we need top molecular biologists to detect it. For that, Nigerian scientists need to be in contact with their colleagues in other countries. The quality of training we received abroad gave us the confidence and expertise to work with leading scientists on COVID-19, to understand its genetic-sequence data and to use World Health Organization-approved target sequences (DNA primers and probes for amplifying any viral material) to set up early-detection capacity in our country.",
            "I am not saying that the ability to travel freely will on its own result in world-class institutions in Nigeria. My country\u2019s government needs to do more to build science here, for instance, by providing more (and more reliable) funding, and establishing a dependable power grid.",
            "The visa ban, no matter its justification, will worsen an already bad situation. It can only have a damaging effect on the Nigerian economy and on Nigerian scientists. And that \u2014 in an increasingly connected world \u2014 will hurt all of us.",
