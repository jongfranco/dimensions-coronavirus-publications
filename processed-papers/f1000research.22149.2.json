        "abstract": "A novel coronavirus recently identified in Wuhan, China (2019-nCoV) has expanded the number of highly pathogenic coronaviruses affecting humans. The 2019-nCoV represents a potential epidemic or pandemic threat, which requires a quick response for preparedness against this infection. The present report uses the informational spectrum methodology to identify the possible origin and natural host of the new virus, as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targets. The performed in silico analysis indicates that the newly emerging 2019-nCoV is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and, to a lesser degree, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Moreover, the well-known SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well. Actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of 2019-nCoV; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection. Additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the 2019-nCoV, and that domain 288-330 of S1 protein from the 2019-nCoV represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target.",

Figure 1a shows the CS of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These CS contain only one dominant peak corresponding to the frequency F(0.257).

This suggests that biological properties of 2019-nCoV are apparently more similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV than to Bat SARS-like CoV.",
            "To confirm this conclusion, the ISM-base phylogenetic tree for S1 proteins was calculated (Figure 2). In this calculation the amplitude on the frequency F(0.257) was used as the distance measure. As observed in Figure 2, all analyzed",
            "2019-nCoV S1 amino acid sequences are grouped with SARSCoV and MERS-CoV and separated from Bat SARS-like CoV. This indicates that 2019-nCoV are more phylogenetically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV than to Bat SARS-like CoV. This result differs from those obtained with the homologybased phylogenetic analysis, which showed that 2019-CoV are closely related to Bat SARS-like CoV (https://platform.gisaid.org/ epi3/frontend#lightbox1296857287).",
            "It has been previously shown that the dominant frequency in the informational spectrum of viral envelope proteins corresponds to interaction between the virus and its receptor[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. The ISM analysis showed that the frequency component F(0.257) is present in the CS of S1 SARS-CoV and its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], but not in the CS of S1 MERS-CoV and its main receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Of note is that both receptors ACE2 and DPP4 are expressed in airway epithelia.

The dominant peak on the frequency F(0.257) in the CS of S1 from",
            "SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and ACE2 supports this possibility (Figure 3), although this has not been formally proved for MERS-CoV11.",
            "As it is shown in Figure 1a, the frequency F(0.257) is also present in the informational spectrum of the 2019-nCoV, suggesting that ACE2 might be the receptor for this novel coronavirus too. Calculation of the CS for S1 protein from the 2019-nCoV and all ACE2 sequences available at the UniProt database revealed that the highest amplitudes on the frequency F(0.257) correspond to ACE2 from civet and chicken. This result indicates that these species can be included as potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the 2019-nCoV. However, it is possible that 2019-nCoV viruses use very different receptors in the natural host(s) and not only the ACE2 as it is the putative case in humans.",
            "Finally, the S1 amino acid sequence from the 2019-nCoV was scanned to look for the domain that gives the highest contribution to the information represented by the frequency F(0.257) (Figure 4a). This analysis revealed domain 266\u2013330",

            "To identify the host proteins involved in the attachment and/ or internalization of the 2019-nCoV, the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org) was screened by ISM for human proteins with the dominant peak on the frequency F(0.478). The list of human proteins that have a dominant peak in IS at the frequency F(0.478) are given in Table 3. According to the IS criterion, these proteins are potential candidate interactors with the 2019-nCoV S1 protein. Further, literature data mining was performed to identify which proteins presented in Table 3 might be involved in the processes of infection with human coronaviruses. This analysis revealed that the actin protein plays an important role in the early entry events during human coronavirus infections[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Actin proteins were selected as the best candidate interactors for the 2019-nCoV among the host proteins that are characterized with frequency F(0.478). Figure 5c shows that CS of actins from different mammalian species (Table 4) contains the dominant peak on F(0.478), suggesting that these proteins probably encode",
            "the conserved information important for their biological function.",
            "The data mining of the PubMed database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/pubmed/) also showed that actin protein plays an important role in the rapid virus cell-to-cell spread and dissemination of infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Additionally, the actin filament reorganization is a key step in lung inflammation induced by systemic inflammatory responses caused by infectious agents[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. These findings indicate that interaction between actin proteins and the S1 could be involved in the infection and pathogenesis of 2019-nCoV. In consequence, the possibility to interfere on this interaction might represent a valid hypothesis for development of promising prevention and therapeutic strategies.",
            "Interestingly, further data mining revealed that ibuprofen (FDA approved drug with excellent safety record) attenuates interleukin-1\u03b2-induced inflammation as well as actin reorganization[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Actin was also found to be the primary component by which ibuprofen can bind to the tissue in different organs[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. This suggests that ibuprofen might impact the 2019-nCoV-induced disease by indirect interaction with actin proteins. Previously, ibuprofen was predicted as a candidate entry inhibitor for Ebola virus using the same in silico approach[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], and this prediction was confirmed experimentally at a later time point[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. These results prompt the possibility to experimentally test the effects of ibuprofen on 2019-nCoV infection under in vitro and in vivo conditions.",
            "In silico methods are considered very important tools to generate first hypotheses and identify first drug candidates against newly discovered agents, like in the case of 2019-nCoV, especially in the short-term. ISM, a technology based on electronic biology, allowed identifying potential importance of human actin proteins for viral infection/dissemination as well as one FDA approved drug that may have an indirect antiviral activity within weeks of the initial outbreak. However, additional experiments are required to confirm our initial findings.",
            "In conclusion, results of the presented in silico analysis suggest the following: (i) the newly emerging 2019-nCoV is highly related to SARS-CoV and, to a lesser degree, Table 3.
