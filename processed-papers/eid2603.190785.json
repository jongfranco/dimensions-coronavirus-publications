            "In conclusion, the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in NYC reflects the diverse population of this city. The consistently elevated burden in men probably related to sexual transmission among MSM warrants outreach to this community and their providers to increase awareness. Furthermore, messaging related to prevention and treatment for cryptosporidiosis should be targeted to international travelers, particularly parents of children in NYC who travel to the Dominican Republic during the summer months. We anticipate the reported incidence of cryptosporidiosis to continue to increase with the increasing use of syndromic multiplex panels and that the demographic profiles of the patients might also change as these new diagnostics are adopted more widely. These observed patterns of disease might also be present in other urban, diverse jurisdictions, both nationally and internationally."

        "discussion": [
            "An analysis of cryptosporidiosis surveillance data collected in NYC during 1995\u20132018 suggests that the epidemiology of the parasitic enteric infection in this large, urban, international setting is multifaceted. Although the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in NYC decreased dramatically after the introduction of HAART in the mid-1990s, incidence remained consistently higher among men in NYC, probably reflecting an enduring burden of disease in men who have sex with men (MSM). We also found that cryptosporidiosis was common in children in NYC, probably driven by summertime international travel to disease-endemic areas. Finally, the recent introduction of syndromic multiplex diagnostic panels has led to not only a major increase in the reported incidence of cryptosporidiosis but also to a shift in the demographic makeup of reported cryptosporidiosis patients in NYC.<br/><br/>Our data show that the burden of cryptosporidiosis has been consistently elevated among adult men 20\u201359 years of age in NYC, probably driven by personto-person sexual transmission among MSM. Although we did not have reliable data on patient MSM status, high rates of cryptosporidiosis among men were consistently identified in areas known to have an aboveaverage proportion of residents who are MSM, such as Chelsea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Patients in this age/sex group were more likely to report sexual practices with increased risk for fecal contact during the incubation period than were those in any other age/sex group in NYC. MSM are historically at greater risk for cryptosporidiosis, not only because of a higher prevalence of AIDS in this population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] but also because of sexual practices, such as anilingus, that entail a low risk for HIV transmission but increase the risk for fecal contact [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]."

        ],
        "limitations": [
            "Our study has several limitations. Interviewed patients tended to be of higher socioeconomic status than those who were not interviewed, which might bias our results because wealthier patients might have different risk exposures than patients who live in neighborhoods of high poverty. Furthermore, the period of interest for risk factor exposure decreased during 2010, which might have reduced the proportion of persons reporting risk factors over time. Finally, some race and ethnicity data were not collected by self-report and therefore might not accurately capture self-identified race and ethnicity of patients. Notwithstanding these limitations, the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis merits continued attention because the incidence will probably continue to increase in NYC, as well as in other jurisdictions across the United States [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], given the cost-effectiveness of syndromic multiplex panels [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. Public health surveillance activities will need to take the improved case detection and increases in hospital/laboratory-specific catchment areas into account when guiding public health action [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]."

        "Discussion": [
            "An analysis of cryptosporidiosis surveillance data collected in NYC during 1995\u20132018 suggests that the epidemiology of the parasitic enteric infection in this large, urban, international setting is multifaceted. Although the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in NYC decreased dramatically after the introduction of HAART in the mid-1990s, incidence remained consistently higher among men in NYC, probably reflecting an enduring burden of disease in men who have sex with men (MSM). We also found that cryptosporidiosis",
            "was common in children in NYC, probably driven by summertime international travel to disease-endemic areas. Finally, the recent introduction of syndromic multiplex diagnostic panels has led to not only a major increase in the reported incidence of cryptosporidiosis but also to a shift in the demographic makeup of reported cryptosporidiosis patients in NYC.",
            "Our data show that the burden of cryptosporidiosis has been consistently elevated among adult men 20\u201359 years of age in NYC, probably driven by personto-person sexual transmission among MSM. Although we did not have reliable data on patient MSM status, high rates of cryptosporidiosis among men were consistently identified in areas known to have an aboveaverage proportion of residents who are MSM, such as Chelsea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Patients in this age/sex group were more likely to report sexual practices with increased risk for fecal contact during the incubation period than were those in any other age/sex group in NYC. MSM are historically at greater risk for cryptosporidiosis, not only because of a higher prevalence of AIDS in this population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] but also because of sexual practices, such as anilingus, that entail a low risk for HIV transmission but increase the risk for fecal contact [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
            "The dramatic decrease in citywide cryptosporidiosis incidence observed during 1995\u20132000 is consistent with the uptake of HAART among PLWHA in NYC. Cryptosporidiosis is a well-known opportunistic infection among PLWHA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>], and restoration of immune function is the recommended therapy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. The number of deaths from all causes among persons who have AIDS peaked in 1994 in NYC and decreased substantially after the introduction of HAART [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Although cryptosporidiosis rates remain high for PLWHA in NYC, patients without HIV/AIDS now represent most reported patients. This finding is likely not only because of high HAART coverage among patients with HIV/AIDS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] but also because of increased case finding in the general population after introduction of syndromic multiplex diagnostics. Before introduction of these new diagnostics, physicians needed to specifically request cryptosporidiosis testing as part of the traditional ova and parasite testing. Given the dramatic consequences of cryptosporidiosis",
            "among PLWHA, clinicians treating cryptosporidiosis in this population would have likely been more aware of the need to specifically request testing for this parasite before presyndromic multiplex panels were introduced.",
            "In addition to patients who were HIV negative, the introduction of syndromic multiplex testing led to an increase in reported cases among persons who were non-Hispanic white. This finding might reflect the populations residing in the specific catchment areas of the laboratories that use syndromic multiplex panels, as well as disparities in healthcare access by race/ethnicity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. We also identified a higher and increasing burden of cryptosporidiosis among children in NYC, especially after introduction of syndromic multiplex panels. Because children with diarrhea are more likely to be taken to a healthcare facility than adults [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>], the increasing incidence of cryptosporidiosis in the younger age group probably reflects healthcare-seeking behavior along with the improved diagnostic sensitivity of syndromic multiplex panels.",
            "report recreational water contact and international travel, particularly to the Dominican Republic, where they might be in contact with contaminated food or water [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Although recreational water contact is a known risk factor for cryptosporidiosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], no large pool-related outbreaks have been detected in NYC. In addition, most cryptosporidiosis patients reported drinking NYC municipal tap water and using it for household needs. Extensive surveillance is in place to monitor for citywide waterborne cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis outbreaks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. To date, there have been no outbreaks of waterborne disease related to the NYC municipal tap water.",
            "Our study has several limitations. Interviewed patients tended to be of higher socioeconomic status than those who were not interviewed, which might bias our results because wealthier patients might have different risk exposures than patients who live in neighborhoods of high poverty. Furthermore, the period of interest for risk factor exposure decreased during 2010, which might have reduced the proportion of persons reporting risk factors over time. Finally, some race and ethnicity data were not collected by self-report and therefore might not accurately capture self-identified race and ethnicity of patients. Notwithstanding these limitations, the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis merits continued attention because the incidence will probably continue to increase in NYC, as well as in other jurisdictions across the United States [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], given the cost-effectiveness of syndromic multiplex panels [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. Public health surveillance activities will need to take the improved case detection and increases in hospital/laboratory-specific catchment areas into account when guiding public health action [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>].",
            "In conclusion, the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in NYC reflects the diverse population of this city. The consistently elevated burden in men probably related to sexual transmission among MSM warrants outreach to this community and their providers to increase awareness. Furthermore, messaging related to prevention and treatment for cryptosporidiosis should be targeted to international travelers, particularly parents of children in NYC who travel to the Dominican Republic during the summer months. We anticipate the reported incidence of cryptosporidiosis to continue to increase with the increasing use of syndromic multiplex panels and that the demographic profiles of the patients might also change as these new diagnostics are adopted more widely. These observed patterns of disease might also be present in other urban, diverse jurisdictions, both nationally and internationally."

            "An analysis of cryptosporidiosis surveillance data collected in NYC during 1995\u20132018 suggests that the epidemiology of the parasitic enteric infection in this large, urban, international setting is multifaceted.",
            "The authors did not have reliable data on patient MSM status, high rates of cryptosporidiosis among men were consistently identified in areas known to have an aboveaverage proportion of residents who are MSM, such as Chelsea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]",
            "Patients in this age/sex group were more likely to report sexual practices with increased risk for fecal contact during the incubation period than were those in any other age/sex group in NYC.",
            "MSM are historically at greater risk for cryptosporidiosis, not only because of a higher prevalence of AIDS in this population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] but because of sexual practices, such as anilingus, that entail a low risk for HIV transmission but increase the risk for fecal contact [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]"
