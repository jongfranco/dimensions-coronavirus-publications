Inconclusive clinical evidence should not be a reason for abandoning corticosteroid use in 2019-nCoV pneumonia.",
            "Moreover, there are studies sup\u00ad porting the use of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate dose in patients with coronavirus infection. For example, in a retrospective study of 401 patients with SARS,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] proper use of corticosteroids was found to reduce mortality and shorten the length of stay in hospital for critically ill patients with SARS without causing secondary infection and other complications. Relevant research has also been done for other virus-associated respiratory diseases, such as influenzaassociated pneumonia. For example, in a prospective cohort study enrolling 2141 patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm[09] viral pneumonia from 407 hospitals in China,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] low-tomoderate dose of corticosteroids (25\u2013150 mg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) reduced mortality in patients with oxygen index lower than 300 mm Hg. Besides, a systematic review[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] suggested corticosteroids could reduce mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia.",
            "Because of methodological limita\u00ad tions in the available evidence, the use of corticosteroids remains controversial. We acknowledge the potential risks associated with highdose corticosteroids in treating 2019-nCoV pneumonia, such as secondary infec\u00adtions, long-term complications, and prolonged virus shedding. However, in critically ill patients, the overwhelming inflam\u00ad mation and cytokine-related lung injury might cause rapidly progressive pneumonia. Given the inconclusive evidence and urgent clinical demand, physicians from the Chinese Thoracic Society have developed an expert consensus statement on the use of corticosteroids in 2019-nCoV pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] All members of the expert panel participated in treating patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The expert consensus statement is based both on the available published scientific literature and relevant research by panel members, and it was brought together through e-mail correspondence and online meetings.",
            "According to the expert consensus statement, the following basic principles should be followed when using corticosteroids: (1) the benefits and harms should be carefully weighed before using cortico\u00adsteroids; (2) cortico\u00ad steroids should be used prudently in critically ill patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia; (3) for patients with hyp\u00ad oxaemia due to underlying diseases or who regularly use corticosteroids for chronic diseases, further use of corticosteroids should be cautious; and (4) the dosage should be lowto-moderate (\u22640\u00b75\u20131 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone or equival\u00adent) and the duration should be short (\u22647 days).",
            "Corticosteroid treatment is a doubleedged sword. In line with the expert consen\u00adsus, we oppose liberal use of corticosteroids and recommend short courses of corticosteroids at low-tomoderate dose, used prudently, for critically ill patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Existing evidence is inconclusive, and even systematic reviews and meta analyses on this topic reach differing conclusions. Therefore, in line with Russell and colleagues,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] we believe that there is a need for well designed randomised controlled trials in the future to promote a more solid foundation for treatment recommendations.",

            "The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19; previously known as 2019-nCoV) outbreak that originated from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, at the end of 2019 was declared a public health emergency of international concern on Jan 30, 2020, by WHO.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] As a newly appearing infectious disease, COVID-19 garnered great research interest. According to a recent report in Nature,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] at least 54 academic papers about COVID-19 were published in English-language journals by Jan 30, 2020.",
            "We searched major Chinese data\u00ad bases including the China National Knowledge Internet and WANFANG Data. As of Feb 3, 2020, just 23 Chineselanguage papers on COVID-19 were published. These publications mainly focused on epidemiology, clinical fea\u00ad tures of COVID-19, and the structure or genetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",
            "Many of the research papers about COVID-19 in international journals were written by researchers in China, which led to great concerns because these findings cannot directly benefit frontline health professionals and policy makers because of the language barrier. It is critical for health science to be published in English-language journals to facilitate communication and enable global coordination and timely epidemic response. However, some media were concerned that Chinese researchers within academic organisations concentrated on publishing papers in prestigious international journals but paid inadequate attention to epidemic prevention of COVID-19 and neglected to disseminate their findings within Chinese-language journals.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] A recent statement by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China also encouraged researchers to focus their efforts on epidemic prevention and to publish their results in Chinese.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]",
            "The emphasis on publishing clinical research in English helps to facilitate knowledge exchange between Chinese scientists and the rest of the world. We hope the research community will make efforts to disseminate all findings relevant to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Chinese in addition to English publishing outlets.",
            "For example, clinical research papers about COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 in any Lancet journal were translated into Chinese, and these translated Articles were provided rapidly to the public in China free of charge.",
            "Broad dissemination in both Chinese and English will accomplish the goals of communicating timely and crucial findings to the international scientific community, while also disseminating this information to health-care workers on the frontline who need to under\u00ad stand the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19. This strategy will improve effective control strategies to ultimately contain the virus and protect the health of the public.",
