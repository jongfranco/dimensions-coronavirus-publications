        "abstract": "Delineation of the intricacies of protein function from macromolecular structure constitutes a continual obstacle in the study of cell and pathogen biology. Structure-based phylogenetic analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing this challenge, allowing the detection and quantification of conserved architectural properties between proteins, including those with low or no detectable sequence homology. With a focus on viral protein structure, we highlight how a number of investigations have utilized this powerful method to infer common functionality and ancestry.",

            "In light of the expansive genomic diversity revealed by viral surveillance initiatives (Li et al 2015; Shi et al 2018), SBPA has proven to complement sequence analysis tools as a tour de force method for gleaning evolutionary relationships between genetically distinct viruses. In our review, we have highlighted many instances of how this has been achieved. For example, we discuss how this method has been previously used to show the way the double jelly roll fold, which is found in many viral coat proteins, has evolved to facilitate the assembly of genetically distinct viruses (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRavantti_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rRavantti_et+al_2013_a\">Ravantti, Bamford, and Stuart 2013</a>; Laanto et al 2017). Moreover, we have demonstrated how SBPA provides a blueprint for understanding the means by which bacteriophage endosialidase scaffolds may have evolved from six-bladed b-propeller proteins of non-viral origin (Fig. 2A). Importantly, however, we note that the presented case-studies are not exhaustive and that there are other biological systems amenable to investigation by this powerful method. For instance, a series of SBPA-based studies focused on the structurally conserved common core of right-handed RNA and DNA polymerases have successfully recapitulated the relationships of the six established right-handed polymerase families in a single phylogeny (Cerny et al 2014; Monttinen et al 2014; Cerny et al 2015; Jacome et al 2015)."

Over the past decades, numerous tools have been developed to determine similarities between three-dimensional protein structures, including but not limited to HOMOLOGY (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRao_1973_a\" href=\"#rRao_1973_a\">Rao and Rossmann 1973</a>), Structural Homology Program (SHP) (Stuart et al 1979), COMPARER (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSali_1990_a\" href=\"#rSali_1990_a\">Sali and Blundell 1990</a>), DALI (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHolm_1993_a\" href=\"#rHolm_1993_a\">Holm and Sander 1993</a>), CE (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cShindyalov_1998_a\" href=\"#rShindyalov_1998_a\">Shindyalov and Bourne 1998</a>), MAMMOTH (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOrtiz_et+al_2002_a\" href=\"#rOrtiz_et+al_2002_a\">Ortiz, Strauss, and Olmea 2002</a>), FATCAT (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYe_2004_a\" href=\"#rYe_2004_a\">Ye and Godzik 2004</a>), SSM (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKrissinel_2004_a\" href=\"#rKrissinel_2004_a\">Krissinel and Henrick 2004</a>), Expresso/3D Coffee (Poirot et al 2004; Armougom et al 2006), Multiple Structural Alignment Algorithm (MUSTANG) (Konagurthu et al 2006), SALIGN (Braberg et al 2012), CLICK (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNguyen_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rNguyen_et+al_2011_a\">Nguyen, Tan, and Madhusudhan 2011</a>), and Homologous Structure Finder (HSF) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRavantti_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rRavantti_et+al_2013_a\">Ravantti, Bamford, and Stuart 2013</a>).

            "A pairwise structural alignment involves establishing the degree of equivalence between two superimposed structures. Conventionally, a measure of the root-mean-square distance between the corresponding Ca atoms of a pair of superimposed protein structures has been used to define structural similarity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRossmann_1976_a\" href=\"#rRossmann_1976_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRossmann_1976_a\" href=\"#rRossmann_1976_a\">Rossmann and Argos 1976</a></a>). While such Ca alignment calculations work well for architecturally conserved proteins, they can be less adequate when comparing protein structures that are only remotely related. Therefore, pairwise structural alignments can be improved by added analysis of an array of parameters, such as solvent accessibility, dihedral angles, and local secondary structure. For example, MUSTANG (Konagurthu et al 2006) aligns residues on the basis of similarity in residue\u2013residue contact patterns and local structural topology, SHP (Stuart et al 1979) utilizes the shape of the local polypeptide chain and a rotation function (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRossmann_1976_a\" href=\"#rRossmann_1976_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRossmann_1976_a\" href=\"#rRossmann_1976_a\">Rossmann and Argos 1976</a></a>) that infers the relative orientation of structures, and HSF (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRavantti_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rRavantti_et+al_2013_a\">Ravantti, Bamford, and Stuart 2013</a>) analyzes physiochemical and geometrical properties of the residues as well as local secondary structure.",
            "Following pairwise structural alignments, HSF and MUSTANG (but not SHP) perform hierarchical categorization in a step termed \u2018classification\u2019. In HSF (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRavantti_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rRavantti_et+al_2013_a\">Ravantti, Bamford, and Stuart 2013</a>), the initial set of equivalent residues identified by pairwise comparison forms a common structural core between the two structures. Comparison of similarities between structural cores established from all of the pairwise alignments generates new combined cores (i.e. new sets of equivalent residues), which will subsequently be used to repeat this recursive alignment process until the pool of input structures under comparison is diminished. As each class grows to encompass more closely related structures, a full hierarchical classification is generated. Similarly, residue\u2013residue similarity scores are generated by comparison of equivalent contiguous structural cores within MUSTANG (Konagurthu et al 2006), where pairwise alignments are compared in the context of multiple structures to align classes.",
            "Finally, the relatedness of protein structures can be calculated quantitatively and plotted as an unrooted tree (of unknown origin), reflecting the distances (branch length) between protein structures. SHP, MUSTANG, and HSF calculate so-called \u2018evolutionary distances\u2019 from similarity scores or probabilities of equivalence, as detailed in Bamford, Grimes, and Stuart (2005; SHP), Konagurthu et al (2006; MUSTANG), and Ravantti, Bamford, and Stuart (2013; HSF). Subsequently, structure-based phylogenetic trees can be plotted from distance matrices and visualized using packages such as PHYLIP (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFelsenstein_1989_a\" href=\"#rFelsenstein_1989_a\">Felsenstein 1989</a>) and Dendroscope (Huson et al 2007).",
            "While it is important not to discount the potential effects of structural determination (e.g. crystal packing) or inherent protein features (structural plasticity/flexibility) upon the calculation of these trees and the conclusions that can be drawn, in the following sections, we demonstrate how SBPA has been successfully used to relate commonalities in origin and function for several well-studied protein folds (Fig. 1)."

        "3. Inferring evolutionary relationships of viruses and viral proteins": [
            "The identification of novel viruses continues to expand our appreciation of the virosphere, revealing a seemingly endless breadth of genomic diversity (Li et al 2015; Shi et al 2018). However, this breadth is not equally reflected in structure, where common protein folds are frequently identified amongst otherwise unrelated virus families (Luo et al 2007; Abrescia et al 2012; Cerny et al 2014; Laanto et al 2017; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAhola_2019_a\" href=\"#rAhola_2019_a\">Ahola 2019</a>). Such disproportion in magnitude of sequence versus structure variation may, in part, be attributed to stereochemical, geometric, and functional constraints on the folds of the protein. Indeed, while evolution of both gene and protein are restricted to maintain functionality, protein structure is additionally constrained to the approximately 2,000 unique folds predicted to exist amongst naturally occurring proteins (Bamford, Burnett, and Stuart 2002; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBamford_2003_a\" href=\"#rBamford_2003_a\">Bamford 2003</a>; Abrescia et al 2012; Oksanen et al 2012). While convergent evolution and gene transfer undoubtedly play an important role in the distribution of protein folds across the orders of life, the identification of conserved folds provides a unique opportunity to establish commonalities of function and even glean insights into evolutionary relationships amongst pathobiologically and genetically distinct viruses."

        "3.1 Using the jelly roll fold to decode evolutionary relationships": [
            "The single jelly roll fold was first observed over forty years ago in a structural study of the capsid of the single-stranded RNA tomato bushy stunt virus (Harrison et al 1978), and was shown to comprise two four-stranded b-sheets that form the opposite sides of a b-barrel. The double jelly roll fold was later observed in the major coat/capsid protein (MCP) of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) human adenovirus (Roberts et al 1986; Stewart et al 1991), and is believed to have evolved via gene duplication and combination of single jelly roll proteins (Krupovic and Koonin 2017). The double jelly roll fold consists of a compact structure consisting of two b-barrels, each composed of eight anti-parallel b-strands arranged in two four-stranded sheets (Fig. 1A). Subsequent structural analysis of the MCP from the dsDNA bacteriophage, PRD1 (Benson et al 1999), unexpectedly showed that the double jelly roll was also present in viruses with prokaryotic hosts. Since then, a myriad of dsDNA viruses and phages from diverse hosts and environments have been observed to present a coat protein with this same fold organization, including those that infect bacteria, archaea, green algae, and humans (i.e. bacteriophage PM2 (Abrescia et al 2008), archaea Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (Khayat et al 2005), Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus (Nandhagopal et al 2002), and vaccinia virus (Bahar et al 2011a), respectively).",
            "The recent structural determination of the MCP from the ssDNA Flavobacterium-infecting, lipid-containing phage (FLiP) (Laanto et al 2017), revealed that despite the difference in the type of genetic material packaged within the virion and the absence of significant sequence similarity to dsDNA viruses, the double jelly roll fold is also present in ssDNA viruses. Indeed, SBPA shows that FLiP MCP branches closely next to bacteriophage PM2 MCP (Laanto et al 2017), supportive of an evolutionary relationship with the MCP members of the PRD1\u2013 adenovirus lineage (Abrescia et al 2012; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRavantti_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rRavantti_et+al_2013_a\">Ravantti, Bamford, and Stuart 2013</a>). While a direct connection between sequences of FLiP MCP and previously characterized MCPs has proven elusive, genomic and metagenomic sequence analyses have linked FLiP to a group of ssDNA phages through their replication proteins (Yutin et al 2018). These phages were shown to encode homologs of the FLiP MCP, suggestive of the existence of more ssDNA viruses with a double jelly roll-MCP (Yutin et al 2018).",
            "These results demonstrate the power of complementary structure- and sequence-based approaches in drawing evolutionary links between diverse viruses.",
            "The identification of shared structural and functional properties (e.g. common mode of capsid assembly and genome replication, respectively) across distinct MCP-bearing DNA viruses supports the existence of a common ancestor for the double jelly roll-MCP of PRD1\u2013adenovirus members (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKrupovic_2008_a\" href=\"#rKrupovic_2008_a\">Krupovic and Bamford 2008</a>, 2011; Krupovic and Koonin 2017).

In line with the relationships inferred by SBPA (Abrescia et al 2012; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRavantti_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rRavantti_et+al_2013_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRavantti_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rRavantti_et+al_2013_a\">Ravantti, Bamford, and Stuart 2013</a></a>; Laanto et al 2017), a megataxonomic framework with a higher-level taxon (Varidnaviria) has recently been proposed to encompass a subset of eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA viruses encoding vertical jelly roll-type MCPs (Koonin et al 2019). Such a framework would potentially facilitate a rational structure-complemented approach for classifying newly identified and genetically diverse viruses bearing jelly roll MCPs."

        "3.2 Functional elaboration of a common protein core": [
            "A phosphoprotein (P) composed of a three-domain assembly (a disordered N-terminal domain, a central oligomerization domain, and a conserved C-terminal domain) plays essential roles in viral RNA synthesis across a number of negative-stranded RNA viruses from the order Mononegavirales, including members of the Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families (Assenberg et al 2010; Ivanov et al 2010; Martinez et al 2013). Although sequence homology of this protein across these families is low and in some cases undetectable (Delmas et al 2010; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKarlin_2012_a\" href=\"#rKarlin_2012_a\">Karlin and Belshaw 2012</a>), structural analyses have revealed that the C-terminal domain (PCTD) of the molecule contains a common a-helical core (Fig. 1B), supporting an evolutionarily conserved function in mediating binding of P to the nucleocapsid protein (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGreen_2009_a\" href=\"#rGreen_2009_a\">Green and Luo 2009</a>; Ribeiro Ede et al 2009). Investigations have shown that in addition to maintaining this conserved role, the PCTD has acquired additional functionality through structural elaboration of the a-helical core. Indeed, the addition of five a-helices to the plant rhabdovirus PCTD, and ahelical and b-sheet subdomains to the filovirus PCTD have both been shown to regulate viral transcription (Das et al 1997) and facilitate additional RNA binding and immune evasion functionality (Leung et al 2009, 2010). The structural elaboration of the evolutionarily conserved PCTD core is reflected upon SBPA (Martinez et al 2013), where PCTD structures from each viral family classify to a single branch on the tree. In this case, SBPA provides an efficient means to visualize how a basic protein fold scaffold has been adapted to achieve different functionalities.",
            "3.3 The b-propeller fold: A plastic architecture allows diverse functionality across domains of life",
            "The six-bladed b-propeller fold (Fig. 1C) facilitates a diverse range of functionalities in an array of microorganisms, viruses, and higher eukaryotes (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGaskell_et+al_1995_a\" href=\"#rGaskell_et+al_1995_a\">Gaskell, Crennell, and Taylor 1995</a>; Chavas et al 2005).

This fold is also present in fucose-specific lectins (Wimmerova et al 2003), soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenases (Oubrie et al 1999), and phytases (Kumar et al 2017).",
            "The canonical six-bladed b-propeller fold is arranged as six b-sheets, each comprising four anti-parallel strands organized around a central axis (Fig. 1C). Previous studies have demonstrated that SBPA of proteins exhibiting this six-bladed b-propeller fold results in the bifurcation of viral and non-viral groups (Bowden et al 2008). Interestingly, these two groups are linked by the endosialidase from the bacteriophage, K1F (Stummeyer et al 2005) (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the split of nonviral and viral six-bladed b-propellers coincides with the division of ASP-box-presenting and ASP-box-lacking b-propellers, respectively. The ASP-box, a short sequence and structural motif that occurs prominently in b-propellers (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cQuistgaard_2009_a\" href=\"#rQuistgaard_2009_a\">Quistgaard and Thirup 2009</a>), is found in non-viral b-propellers (Roggentin et al 1989; Crennell et al 1993) and is absent from b-propellers from RNA viruses within the Orthomyxoviridae (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBurmeister_et+al_1992_a\" href=\"#rBurmeister_et+al_1992_a\">Burmeister, Ruigrok, and Cusack 1992</a>) and Paramyxoviridae families (Crennell et al 2000). Given the presence of two ASP-box motifs in K1F endosialidase, it is possible that this six-bladed b-propeller evolved from other ASP-box presenting b-propellers that are non-viral in origin (Stummeyer et al 2005).",

            "Cellular proteins belonging to the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family modulate apoptosis and hence, play an important role in clearing virus-infected cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYoule_2008_a\" href=\"#rYoule_2008_a\">Youle and Strasser 2008</a>). The Bcl-2 fold consists of six to seven amphipathic a-helices of varying lengths, which surround two central hydrophobic a-helices (Fig. 1D). To impede the host antiviral and innate immune response, some viruses, such as poxviruses, have evolved Bcl-2like proteins (Douglas et al 2007; Kvansakul et al 2008; Maluquer de Motes et al 2011), which exhibit anti-apoptotic functionality. Despite the overall dissimilarity in amino acid sequence and functionality, structural analyses have revealed that the cellular Bcl-2 and poxviral Bcl-2-like proteins exhibit remarkably similar folds (Bahar et al 2011b).",
            "Analogous to the split observed upon SBPA of viral and nonviral six-bladed b-propeller folds (Fig. 2A), SBPA of Bcl-2 and Bcl2-like proteins (Graham et al 2008; Bahar et al 2011b; Neidel et al 2015) reveals a rift between folds of cellular and poxviral origin. Close examination provides several insights into the relationships between these proteins. First, the SBPA reveals that despite low levels of sequence conservation (i.e. vaccinia virus VACV A49 protein shares only 8% sequence identity with myxoma virus MYXV M11 protein (Neidel et al 2015)) and diverse functionality, poxviral Bcl-2-like proteins cluster closely together, suggestive that an ancestral poxvirus acquired a single Bcl-2 family gene and that duplication and diversification events during poxvirus evolution gave rise to structurally related proteins with different immunomodulatory functions (Graham et al 2008; Bahar et al 2011b; Neidel et al 2015).",
            "In addition, SBPA reveals that the structural relationship between poxviral Bcl-2-like proteins echoes their independently acquired functions. Indeed, VACV N1, which has both antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory functions (Maluquer de Motes et al 2011), occupies a position on the phylogenetic tree intermediate between MYXV M11, which only exhibits anti-apoptotic functionality (Douglas et al 2007), and VACV K7, B14, A46, and A52, which only exhibit anti-inflammatory activity (Bowie et al 2000; Harte et al 2003; Stack et al 2005; Chen et al 2008; Graham et al 2008; Kalverda et al 2009).

This transmission potential is, in part, facilitated by the ability of the six-bladed b-propeller domain of the paramyxoviral RBP to productively interact with cell surface receptors that are conserved between different organisms (Eaton et al 2006; Bowden et al 2010; Thibault et al 2017). Paramyxoviral RBPs categorize according to functionality into three groups: hemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase (HN), hemagglutinin (H), and attachment (G) glycoproteins. HN RBPs bind and hydrolyze sialic acid (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVillar_2006_a\" href=\"#rVillar_2006_a\">Villar and Barroso 2006</a>), H RBPs are presented by morbilliviruses and recognize SLAMF1 and nectin-4 receptors (Bieringer et al 2013; Birch et al 2013; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNoyce_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rNoyce_et+al_2013_a\">Noyce, Delpeut, and Richardson 2013</a>; Sakai et al 2013; Melia et al 2014; Ader-Ebert et al 2015; Alves et al 2015; Feng et al 2016; Khosravi et al 2016), and most henipaviral G RBPs are specific to ephrin receptors (Bonaparte et al 2005; Negrete et al 2005; Bowden, Jones, and Stuart 2011; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPernet_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rPernet_et+al_2012_a\">Pernet, Wang, and Lee 2012</a>; Rissanen et al 2017).",
            "SBPA of known paramyxoviral HN, H, and G RBP structures has shown that these viral proteins segregate according to receptor-specificity (Bowden et al 2008; Lee et al 2015; Rissanen et al 2017; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cStelfox_2019_a\" href=\"#rStelfox_2019_a\">Stelfox and Bowden 2019</a>; Pryce et al 2020) (Fig. 2B). Indeed, despite sialic acid and ephrin-specific RBPs exhibiting low levels of sequence conservation within their respective classes (in some cases, less than 30%), these two groups of RBPs form distinct structural classes. Interestingly, although henipaviral G RBPs and morbilliviral H RBPs both bind proteinaceous receptors (ephrin and SLAMF1/nectin-4, respectively), they occupy unique branches. This observation is consistent with the contrasting modes of henipaviral and morbilliviral receptor recognition (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZeltina_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rZeltina_et+al_2016_a\">Zeltina, Bowden, and Lee 2016</a>) and supports the hypothesis that the departure of an ancestral virus from sialic acid to protein receptor specificity may have occurred more than once during paramyxovirus evolution (Bowden et al 2008).",
            "In addition, we note that the RBP from the henipavirus, Mojiang virus (MojV-G RBP) (Wu et al 2014; Rissanen et al 2017), falls outside the ephrin-specific G RBP grouping, and also away from H and HN RBPs (Fig. 2B).

Similarly, the zoonotic paramyxovirus, Sosuga virus (SosV) (Albarino et al 2014), also displays a distinct RBP structure, despite presenting some of the conserved residues known to be integral for sialic acid binding and hydrolysis. Indeed, unlike the HN RBPs of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and mumps virus (MuV), for example, SosVRBP presents a putative receptor-binding site incompatible with known modes of HN functionality (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cStelfox_2019_a\" href=\"#rStelfox_2019_a\">Stelfox and Bowden 2019</a>).

Indeed, this differential functionality is reflected upon SBPA, which reveals that the structurally divergent NL10 and NL11 form a distinct branch that is nearly equidistant from the archetypal influenza A- and B-type NA structural groupings (Fig. 2C) (Li et al 2012; Zhu et al 2012).",
            "While the receptor for HL18 has yet to be reported, the major histocompatibility complex class II human leukocyte antigen DR isotype (HLA-DR) has been identified as a receptor required for host cell attachment for HL17 (Karakus et al 2019). Interestingly, both HL17 and HL18 do not exhibit great structural divergence from typical HA molecules, indicating that few alterations to the HA scaffold have been required to utilize this proteinaceous receptor (Karakus et al 2019). Indeed, in contrast to the relatively large structural distances observed for NL10 and NL11 from classical influenza virus NAs (Fig. 2C), SBPA reveals that HL17 and HL18 locates closely to genetically related HA subtypes (Russell et al 2008; Lazniewski et al 2018) (Fig. 3). It is likely that the preservation of this close structural proximity, whilst adapting to different receptors, may reflect a functionally constrained requirement for HL17 and HL18 to also facilitate the conserved process of membrane fusion."

        "4.3 Discrete structural and functional states of the arenaviral GP1": [
            "Arenaviruses can be genetically and geographically categorized into Old World (OW) and New World (NW) serocomplexes (Emonet et al 2009). Both OW and NW arenaviruses display a glycoprotein complex, GPC, which is composed of a retained stable signal peptide, GP1 attachment glycoprotein, and membrane-anchored GP2 fusion glycoprotein. Structural studies have shown that the arenaviral GP1 presents a compact a/b fold, and the GP2 forms a class I type fusion architecture (Bowden et al 2009; Abraham et al 2010; Igonet et al 2011; Parsy et al 2013; Cohen-Dvashi et al 2015; Mahmutovic et al 2015; Hastie et al 2016, 2017; Li et al 2016; Israeli et al 2017; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cShimon_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rShimon_et+al_2017_a\">Shimon, Shani, and Diskin 2017</a>; Zeltina et al 2017; Clark et al 2018; Pryce et al 2018) (Fig. 1F). Similar to paramyxoviral RBPs, Figure 3. SBPA of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA). Structures of influenza A virus HAs used were as follows: A/Brevig mission H1 (1RUZ), A/Japan H2 (2WRD), A/Finland H3 (2YP2), A/Czechoslovakia H4 (5XL5), A/Vietnam H5 (2FK0), A/New York H6 (4WSR), A/Italy H7 (1TI8), A/Hong Kong H9 (1JSD), A/Jiangxi-Donghu H10 (4QY1), A/Maryland H13 (4KPQ), A/Astrakhan H14 (3EYJ), A/Western Australia H15 (5TG8), A/Sweden H16 (4FIU), A/Guatemala HL17 (4I78), and A/Peru HL18 (4MC5). A pairwise evolutionary distance matrix was created using SHP (Stuart et al 1979) and displayed as an unrooted phylogenetic tree using PHYLIP (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFelsenstein_1989_a\" href=\"#rFelsenstein_1989_a\">Felsenstein 1989</a>). The HA structures are shown in cartoon representation. HA1 domains for HL17 and HL18 are colored as a rainbow from the N- (blue) to C-terminus (red). HA1 domains for other HAs are colored white, while HA2 domains are colored dark gray. Branches indicating groups 1 and 2 influenza A virus HAs are colored blue and green, respectively. Calculated evolutionary distances derived from this analysis are indicated next to each branch.",
            "arenaviruses recognize a diverse array of receptors, including adystroglycan (OW and clade C NW) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCao_1998_a\" href=\"#rCao_1998_a\">Cao 1998</a>; Spiropoulou et al 2002), dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3grabbing non-integrin (OW) (Shimojima et al 2012; Goncalves et al 2013), lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (Lassa virus, LASV) (Jae et al 2014), neuropilin-2 (Lujo virus, LUJV) (Raaben et al 2017), tetraspanin CD63 (LUJV) (Raaben et al 2017), and transferrin receptor 1 (clades B and D NW) (Radoshitzky et al 2007; Abraham et al 2009; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZong_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rZong_et+al_2014_a\">Zong, Fofana, and Choe 2014</a>). Non-covalently associated SSP\u2013GP1\u2013GP2 protomers are displayed on the mature virion surface as trimeric spikes (Li et al 2016), where the location of the GP1 and GP2 have been determined by fitting a high resolution structure of a trimeric GP1\u2013GP2 complex into a low resolution electron cryo-microscopy-derived map of the virion-displayed GPC (Hastie et al 2017). Interestingly, it has been observed that the OW arenaviral GP1 presents different conformations in GP2-bound and unbound forms, where the GP2 is likely required to stabilize the conformation of GP1 observed on the mature GPC (Crispin et al 2016; Hastie and Saphire 2018; Pryce et al 2018).",
            "A recent structural study utilized SBPA to classify the conformational states of OW and NW arenaviral GP1 glycoproteins and relate the potential physiological roles of these discrete structural classes to differential antigenicity (Pryce et al 2018). This analysis revealed that GP1 glycoproteins broadly divide into two branches (Fig. 4) dependent on their OW or NW lineage. Close examination of the structure-based phylogenetic tree reveals that OW arenaviral GP1 glycoproteins subdivide into two separate structural classes: one class comprises structures of OW GP1s solved in association with a cognate OW GP2 (GP2-bound), and the other contains GP1 structures solved in the absence of a GP2 (GP2-free). The existence of two discrete OW arenaviral GP1 conformations highlights the potential for antigenic deconfiguration of the molecule once shed from the GPC during host cell entry (Branco et al 2010; Hastie et al 2017; Pryce et al 2018), and provides a structure-based rationale for how shed OW GP1 may serve as an immunological decoy that contributes to the often ineffective humoral immune response observed early in the infection (Fisher-Hoch et al 2000; Lukashevich et al 2008; Branco et al 2010). The hypothesis that GP2-free OW GP1 glycoproteins present epitopes not represented on the mature GPC is supported by the absence of an effective humoral immune response upon immunization with recombinant OW GP1 (Borenstein-Katz et al 2019).",
            "Inspection of the SBPA reveals that the GP1 structures from NW Machupo virus (MACV), Jun\u0131n virus (JUNV), and Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV) separate into two branches according to respective clades B and D classification (Pryce et al 2018). Due to the current paucity of GP2-bound NW GP1 structures, it is unknown whether the NW GP1 exhibits the same structural plasticity as OW GP1s. However, this has been hypothesized to be unlikely as GP2-free NW GP1 elicits a neutralizing antibody immune response following immunization in animal models, is recognized by vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies, and recognizes the host transferrin receptor 1 (Abraham et al 2010; Mahmutovic et al 2015; Zeltina et al 2017; Clark et al 2018; Borenstein-Katz et al 2019).",
            "Strikingly, we note that the GP2-free structure of the GP1 glycoprotein from LUJV, a pathogenic OW arenavirus (Briese et al 2009), presents a dramatically different architecture to previously reported NW and OW arenaviral GP1 structures (CohenDvashi, Kilimnik, and Diskin 2018). LUJV GP1 was crystallized in complex with the neuropilin-2 receptor, indicative that the observed conformation is likely representative to that observed on the mature GPC. In line with the unique receptor tropism characteristics and structure of LUJV GP1, which includes features observed in both NW arenaviral GP1s and OW arenaviral GP2bound GP1s (Cohen-Dvashi, Kilimnik, and Diskin 2018), SBPA reveals that the glycoprotein falls outside both NW and OW classes (Fig. 4). Indeed, the near-equal structural distance of LUJV GP1 from both NW and OW GP1 classes is supportive of the hypothesis that the glycoprotein structurally and functionally diverged early in the evolutionary bifurcation of OW and NW arenaviruses."

        "5. Conclusions": [
            "In light of the expansive genomic diversity revealed by viral surveillance initiatives (Li et al 2015; Shi et al 2018), SBPA has proven to complement sequence analysis tools as a tour de force method for gleaning evolutionary relationships between genetically distinct viruses. In our review, we have highlighted many instances of how this has been achieved. For example, we discuss how this method has been previously used to show the way the double jelly roll fold, which is found in many viral coat proteins, has evolved to facilitate the assembly of genetically distinct viruses (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRavantti_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rRavantti_et+al_2013_a\">Ravantti, Bamford, and Stuart 2013</a>; Laanto et al 2017). Moreover, we have demonstrated how SBPA provides a blueprint for understanding the means by which bacteriophage endosialidase scaffolds may have evolved from six-bladed b-propeller proteins of non-viral origin (Fig. 2A). Importantly, however, we note that the presented case-studies are not exhaustive and that there are other biological systems amenable to investigation by this powerful method. For instance, a series of SBPA-based studies focused on the structurally conserved common core of right-handed RNA and DNA polymerases have successfully recapitulated the relationships of the six established right-handed polymerase families in a single phylogeny (Cerny et al 2014; Monttinen et al 2014; Cerny et al 2015; Jacome et al 2015).",
            "It seems likely that SBPA will continue to play an important role in characterizing and rationalizing the pathobiological features of newly emerging viruses. Indeed, we have shown that this is possible for emerging paramyxoviruses, where the receptor-binding domain, an important determinant of host cell tropism, structurally classifies according to receptor specificity (Rissanen et al 2017; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cStelfox_2019_a\" href=\"#rStelfox_2019_a\">Stelfox and Bowden 2019</a>; Pryce et al 2020) (Fig. 2B). Similarly, reflective of their sialic acid independent functionality, NL glycoproteins from bat borne influenza viruses form a structural class that is distinct from archetypal NA glycoproteins (Fig. 2C). Analogously, SBPA of the RNA virus",
            "phosphoprotein CTD core (Martinez et al 2013) and Bcl-2/Bcl-2like proteins (Graham et al 2008; Bahar et al 2011b; Neidel et al 2015) provides a context for how a common protein fold may be elaborated to achieve distinct functionality.",
            "SBPA can also lead to structure-guided hypotheses of whether the glycoproteins displayed by emerging viruses may be capable of misleading the antibody-mediated immune response through the formation of structural classes that are distinct from those presented on the mature virion (Pryce et al 2018) (Fig. 4). However, it should be noted that the intricacies of viral protein function may not always be unambiguously represented by means of SBPA. Indeed, the absence of receptorspecific clustering for C-terminal domains of the S1 receptorbinding subunit (S1-CTD) from the family Coronaviridae (Fig. 5) suggests a complex evolutionary history for these viruses, which may have involved the switch to the same host cell receptor (e.g. ACE2) on multiple occasions (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_2005_a\" href=\"#rLi_2005_a\">Li 2005</a>, 2008, 2015; Wu et al 2009; Song et al 2018). Thus, where SBPA is feasible, it constitutes an important resource in the toolkit of strategies that can be used for characterizing, relating, and predicting the functionality of proteins presented by biomedically important viruses. As such, we suggest that future work focused on comparison and development of SBPA methods will be of great value for the structural virology community and efforts to understand virus pathobiology at a holistic level."
