        "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.",

            "Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSCoV) first emerged in humans in 2003 after transmitting from animals in open-air markets in China[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].

At the same time, improvements in next-generation sequencing technology led to a boom of virus discovery, uncovering thousands of virus sequences in wild animal populations around the world. While most of these viruses have never been found in humans, many are genetically similar to known human viruses within the betacoronavirus genus. The betacoronaviruses are further divided into four lineages (that is, A\u2013D). Lineage B, which includes SARS-CoV and the newly emerging SARSCoV-2, has approximately 200 published virus sequences, whereas lineage C, which includes Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has over 500 viral sequences."

            "ACE2 entry is lineage B clade 1 specific. The RBD of lineage B betacoronaviruses is a single, continuous domain that contains all of the structural information necessary to interact with the host receptor (Fig. 1a,b). We introduced silent mutations in the codonoptimized coding sequence for SARS-CoV to facilitate replacing the SARS RBD with the RBD from other lineage B viruses (Fig. 1b). All lineage B sequences were downloaded from online repositories",
            "and parsed to 29 unique RBD sequences, representing all published variations of the lineage B RBD (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). These 29 RBDs phylogenetically cluster into three clades, as previously described[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], but these RBD clades were not apparent in phylogenetic analysis of other viral sequences, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Extended Data Fig. 1c). All 29 RBDs were codon optimized, synthesized and cloned in place of the SARS RBD, generating chimeric spike expression constructs. We then produced vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) reporter particles pseudotyped with the chimeric spikes (Fig. 1c)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. We chose VSV over lentiviruses as our pseudotype platform because lentiviral pseudotypes have failed to accurately reflect viral entry with bat coronavirus spike protein[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. All constructs exhibited similar levels of expression in producer cells and incorporation into VSV pseudotypes, except the chimera with BM48-31, which displayed somewhat reduced expression compared with the wild-type SARS spike (Fig. 1d). We then infected baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing the receptor for SARS-CoV or empty vector (Fig. 1e) and observed that only clade 1, which includes SARS-CoV, could enter cells transfected with human ACE2 (Fig. 1e).",
            "Protease enhances clade 2 entry. After binding the host receptor, host-cell protease cleaves spike, releasing the fusion peptide and allowing for host-cell entry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Previous studies have shown that an absence of the host protease or incompatibility between the host protease and viral spike can block viral entry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. To circumvent host-cell protease incompatibility or absence, we protease treated our pseudotype panel and infected a wide variety of cell types from different host species (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). In the absence of exogenous protease, only clade 1 infected cells from African green monkey kidney, human gastrointestinal tract, human liver and porcine kidney, in agreement with previous studies. Surprisingly, exogenous protease enhanced entry of a subset of clade 2 spike chimeras in nonhuman primate, bat and human cells (Fig. 2). Importantly, VSV-G-pseudotyped particles were able to produce luciferase signal in all cell lines tested in this study (Extended Data Fig. 2).",
            "Clade 2 entry is receptor dependent. Next, we tested human variants of known betacoronavirus receptors for their ability to mediate cell entry of clade 2 and 3 spike chimeras. We also tested human aminopeptidase N (APN)\u2014a common receptor for alphacoronaviruses (Fig. 3a). Protease treatment only enhanced entry of clade 1 RBDs on cells expressing human ACE2, but not human DPP4 or APN. No entry was observed with clade 2 or 3 spikes, regardless of receptor or protease addition. Human DPP4\u2014a receptor for the lineage C betacoronaviruses\u2014only mediated entry of MERS-CoV, whereas APN only mediated entry of the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E",

            "(Fig. 2b). In the absence of receptor, no entry was observed for any of the pseudotypes, suggesting that protease-mediated entry is receptor dependent (Fig. 2b).",
            "Receptor usage of SARS-CoV-2. While our study was ongoing, a lineage B virus tentatively named SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the cause of a pneumonia outbreak in Hubei, China. Once the sequence was publicly available, we synthesized, cloned and tested the RBD from SARS-CoV-2 in our assay with human variants of known coronavirus receptors. The chimeric SARS\u2013SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expressed was incorporated into particles similarly to other clade 1 chimeric spikes and was capable of entering cells expressing human ACE2, but not any of the other receptors tested (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 3).",
            "Clade determinants for ACE2 usage. Consensus sequences of the three lineage B clades showed several key differences between these groups. Only clade 1 RBDs contain all 14 residues that have been shown through crystallography to interact with human ACE2 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 4). The majority of these residues are absent from clades 2 and 3, which contain additional deletions in surface-exposed loops that cluster at the interface with ACE2 (Fig. 4a,b). We generated a series of clade consensus RBD variants to determine the minimum number of mutations needed to impart ACE2 function on clade 2 and 3 RBDs (Fig. 4c). Introducing the two loop deletions from clade 1 in clade 2 resulted in reduced spike expression, impaired pseudotype incorporation and loss of cell entry (Fig. 4c,d). Restoring these loops in clades 2 and 3 from the loops found in clade 1 did not enhance entry with ACE2",
            "(Fig. 4c; 2 \u2192 1 and 3 \u2192 1 (version 1)). Introducing all 14 ACE2 contact points in clade 2 or 3 also failed to restore ACE2 entry (Fig. 4c; 2 \u2192 1 and 3 \u2192 1 (version 2)). Only replacing all 14 contact points and the surrounding amino acids (known as the receptor-binding motif (RBM)) led to increased ACE2 entry with clade 2 and 3 RBDs (Fig. 4c; 2 \u2192 1 (version 3) = clade 2 residues 322\u2013400 + clade 1 residues 400\u2013501; 3 \u2192 1 (version 3) = clade 3 residues 322\u2013385 + clade 1 residues 386\u2013501).",
            "Full spike and RBD chimeras are comparable. Next, we synthesized full-length clade 2 and 3 spikes to compare with our RBD chimeras. We selected the clade 2 spike As6526 because it consistently gave strong entry signal in human cells following protease treatment (Fig. 2b), as well as BM48-31, the only clade 3 spike in our panel. As we did for SARS-CoV spike, clade 2 and 3 spikes were codon optimized and FLAG tagged, and silent mutations were introduced to facilitate replacing their RBD with the consensus RBD from clade 1 (Fig. 5a). All chimeric constructs expressed similarly, with the exception of the SARS\u2013BM48-31 RBD chimera, which exhibited reduced expression and incorporation (Figs. 1d and 5b). Protease treatment enhanced entry of both the As6526 clade 2 RBD chimera and full-length spike into Huh cells (Fig. 5c). Protease treatment had no effect on either the BM48-31 clade 3 chimera or full-length spike (Fig. 5c). Taken together, these findings show that SARS lineage B RBD chimeras reflect the entry phenotype of full-length lineage B spikes.",
            "Finally, we tested whether receptor binding and protease processing are coupled. We replaced the RBD of full-length clade 2 and 3 spike with the consensus clade 1 RBD and tested pseudotypes on cells expressing ACE2. The clade 1 consensus RBD efficiently facilitated entry of both As6526 and BM48-31 spike only following protease treatment. These findings show that even though BHK cells expressing human ACE2 cells support full-length clade 1 spike entry, just having the RBD from a clade 1 virus was insufficient to mediate efficient entry. As seen in our previous experiments, protease treatment did not enhance pseudotype entry in the absence of host receptor (Fig. 5)."

            "these sequences are lacking. To gain traction on this ever-growing problem, we took a reductionist approach to coronavirus entry and developed a scalable, biosafety level 2-compatible method for testing only the minimal region of the virus essential for interacting with the host receptor (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Because most of these viruses have never been isolated, we resorted to synthetic biology and molecular engineering to reduce the burden of gene synthesis to just a small fragment. Thus, the cost and synthesis production time for testing several spikes for entry in our system is dramatically reduced (Extended Data Fig. 1d). In theory, this approach to functional viromics should be applicable to a wide variety of virus\u2013host proteins and interactions.",
            "Coronavirus entry is a multi-step process involving several distinct domains in spike that mediate virus attachment to the cell surface, receptor engagement, protease processing and membrane fusion[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. While the RBD\u2013receptor interaction is the most studied in this process, recent studies have highlighted the major role host protease processing plays as a species barrier[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Lineage C coronaviruses include MERS-CoV as well as distantly related viruses such as HKU4, HKU5 and PDF-2180 (refs. 25,26). Studies have shown that HKU4 can bind human DPP4 but requires the addition of exogenous trypsin to facilitate cell entry, and that HKU5 and PDF-2180 spikes can enter human cells through an unidentified receptor with protease treatment[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Analogous to these lineage C CoV studies, we observed protease-enhanced entry of lineage B CoVs (Figs. 2, 3 and 5). While it has been shown that host proteases cleave spike, allowing for downstream membrane fusion, other evidence suggests that protease may act on the receptor as well to activate it[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. The addition of protease during the course of SARS-CoV infection facilitated entry in cells with low expression of ACE2 (normally insufficient to support virus entry)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Indeed, we saw evidence of residual trypsin activity on the cells after infection in our studies, as the cell monolayer was loose compared with the untreated condition. Similarly, Menachery et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] also observed cell rounding during their trypsin infections. Therefore, further studies are needed to assess where trypsin is enhancing entry of coronaviruses: at the level of spike, the receptor, or both.",
            "In the absence of exogenous protease, only clade 1 RBDs entered nonhuman primate, human and porcine cell lines (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). These findings are in agreement with previous studies that have either isolated virus (WIV1) or rescued recombinant chimeric viruses (SHC014, Rs4231 and Rs7237)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. However, with trypsin, a subset of genetically similar clade 2 RBDs gained entry in these cells, suggesting that their barrier is at the level of protease processing (Fig. 2a,b). The other spikes from clade 2 and 3 did not enter the cells we tested, regardless of protease addition, suggesting an absent or incompatible receptor. Surprisingly, the protease-dependent entry phenotype was consistent in the reverse spike chimeras in which we replaced the RBD in clade 2 or 3 spike a",
            "with a clade 1 RBD (Fig. 5d), suggesting that either the protease site between S1 and S2 is not compatible with the chimeric spike backbone or the protease is not expressed in these cells (Extended Data Fig. 5). Because clade 1 spikes enter cells expressing human ACE2 without the addition of protease, but clade 2\u2013clade 1 chimeras require protease, our data show that the spike protease cleavage site may be adapted to the protease environment of the receptorbound RBD (Extended Data Fig. 5).",
            "None of the spike pseudotypes efficiently entered Rhinolophus cells, as was observed in previous studies using these cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] (Fig. 2c). Surprisingly, AJi cells were selectively permissive for only clade 2 entry following protease treatment, which suggests that clade 2 RBDs interact with a receptor that is distinct from clade 1 (Fig. 2c). Unfortunately, a common problem with studies assessing viral entry in cell types from different species is accurately measuring surface protein expression of the receptor through conventional methods such as flow cytometry. We have previously shown that DPP4 from different species crossreacts differently with the same DPP4 antibody, confounding correlations between receptor expression level and entry[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>].",
            "Our results show that, despite all of them being classified as the same virus species, most lineage B betacoronaviruses do not use currently known coronavirus receptors (Figs. 1e and 3a,b). We did not observe any pseudotype entry in the presence of protease and the absence of receptor, suggesting that lineage B cell entry is still receptor dependent following protease treatment (Fig. 3b). While our study was ongoing, a lineage B betacoronavirus was identified as the etiological agent behind an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China (SARS-CoV-2). The RBD for SARS-CoV-2 has residues and motifs found in all three clades but forms a distinct clade, so we tested it for receptor usage and observed entry of human ACE2 but not other known coronavirus receptors (Fig. 3d). Interestingly, within the backbone of SARS-CoV spike, cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to the other clade 1 spikes tested, including SARS-CoV. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of using human ACE2 as efficiently, if not more, as SARS-CoV, which may help to explain the human-to-human transmissibility of this virus. Our finding that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 has now been confirmed with the full virus and a computer modellingbased approach[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>].",

            "RBD bound to human ACE2 are largely absent from clade 2 and 3 RBDs, which also contain deletions compared with clade 1 RBMs (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 4a). Simply mutating clades 2 and 3 to have these 14 contact points was insufficient to impart human ACE2 usage, and in some instances even led to protein destabilization and a loss of pseudotype incorporation of spike (Fig. 4c). This is probably because the non-contact residues in the RBM play a critical structural role for these contact points, and indeed, these non-contact residues are different between the clades (Extended Data Fig. 4).",
            "In contrast with changing individual amino acids, our chimeric RBD constructs show that clade 2 and 3 RBDs containing the clade 1 RBM are compatible with human ACE2. Coronaviruses frequently undergo recombination, gaining large swaths of genetic material at once[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Taken together with our data, it is possible that recombination with a clade 1 virus will impart compatibility with human ACE2. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD contains most of the contact points with human ACE2 that are found in clade 1, as well as some amino acid variations that are unique to clades 2 and 3 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Taken together with our receptor assay results, it may be possible that SARS-CoV-2 arose from recombination between clade 1 and the other clades.",

These data show that chimeric spikes generally reproduce the entry phenotypes of full-length spikes. Notably, the full-length As6526 spike did not enter cells as efficiently as the SARS\u2013As6526 chimera, suggesting that other human-cell adaptations are probably needed in As6526 spike.",
            "The capacity to predict the zoonotic potential of newly detected viruses has been severely hindered by a lack of functional data for these animal virus sequences. Here, we have developed a rapid and cost-effective platform with which to functionally test large groups of related viruses for zoonotic potential. We found that several other lineage B coronaviruses are capable of entering human cells through an unknown receptor and that lineage B spike proteins can recombine to gain entry with a known host receptor. Taken together with the latest outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, these findings underscore the importance of continued surveillance of coronaviruses at the sequence and functional levels in order to better prepare for the next emerging virus."

            "Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness.",
            "Improvements in next-generation sequencing technology led to a boom of virus discovery, uncovering thousands of virus sequences in wild animal populations around the world",
            "While most of these viruses have never been found in humans, many are genetically similar to known human viruses within the betacoronavirus genus.",
            "Lineage B, which includes SARS-CoV and the newly emerging SARSCoV-2, has approximately 200 published virus sequences, whereas lineage C, which includes Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has over 500 viral sequences"
