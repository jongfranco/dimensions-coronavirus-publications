        "abstract": "Increased evidence of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) causing diarrhoea in pigs has been reported in several countries worldwide. The virus has currently evolved into three separated groups including US, China and Southeast Asia (SEA) groups. In Vietnam, PDCoV was first reported in 2015. Based on phylogenetic analyses of spike, membrane and nucleocapsid genes, it is suggested that Vietnam PDCoV is chimeric virus. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated the presence of PDCoV in Vietnam and the full\u2010length genomes of six PDCoV isolates identified in 2014\u20132016 were further characterized. The results demonstrated that Vietnam PDCoV was first detected as early as 2014. All six Vietnam PDCoV are in the SEA group and further divided into two separated subgroups including SEA\u20101 and SEA\u20102. Vietnam PDCoV in SEA\u20102 was closely related to Thai and Lao PDCoV. Recombination analysis demon\u2010 strated that three isolates in SEA\u20101 were a chimeric virus of which P12_14_VN_0814, the first Vietnam isolate, and US PDCoV isolates were major and minor parents, re\u2010 spectively. The recombination was further evaluated by phylogenetic construction based on 3 recombinant fragments. The first and third fragments, closely related to P12_14_VN_0814, were associated with ORF1a/1b and N genes, respectively. The second fragment, associated with S, E, and M genes, was closely related to US PDCoV isolates. High antigenic and hydrophobic variations were detected in S1 pro\u2010 tein. Three\u2010day\u2010old pigs challenged with the chimeric virus displayed clinical diseases and villus atrophy. In conclusion, Vietnam PDCoV is genetically diverse influenced by an external introduction from neighbouring countries. The chimeric Vietnam PDCoV can induce a disease similar to Thai PDCoV.",

            "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an enveloped, positive\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA virus belonged to the genus Deltacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWoo_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rWoo_et+al_2010_a\">Woo, Huang, Lau, & Yuen, 2010</a>). PDCoV is the causative agent of a newly emerged enteric disease in pigs characterized by watery diarrhoea, dehydration and death with 40%\u201380% mortality following an outbreak (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJung_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rJung_et+al_2016_a\">Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2016</a>). PDCoV infects enterocytes of the small intestine lead\u2010 ing to villous atrophy and malabsorption (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHu_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rHu_et+al_2015_a\">Hu et al, 2015</a>; Jung et<br/><br/>Transbound Emerg Dis. 2020;67:183\u2013198.    | 184<br/><br/>SAENG\u2010CHUTO et al.<br/><br/>al., 2015). Clinical signs caused by PDCoV resemble those with two viruses in the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, includ\u2010 ing porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gas\u2010 troenteritis virus (TGEV) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJung_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rJung_et+al_2015_a\">Jung et al, 2015</a>), but severity of clinical disease is lesser and piglet mortality is lower. PEDV and TGEV infect pigs of all ages and cause 100% morbidity, with 80%\u2013100% mortality rates in piglets. The higher severity of PEDV and TGEV infection in pigs indicates that the two viruses are more suitable for infecting pigs. On the other hand, PDCoV may not be perfectly adapted to pigs, and the virus may be evolving towards better ability to infect a specific host. Recently, an experimental study in calves suggested that calves are susceptible to infection by PDCoV but not PEDV (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJung_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rJung_et+al_2017_a\">Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2017</a>)."

        "discussion": [
            "In Vietnam, the first detection of PDCoV was reported in 2015 in the southern region of Vietnam (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSaeng\u2010Chuto_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rSaeng\u2010Chuto_et+al_2017_a\">Saeng\u2010Chuto, Lorsirigool, et al, 2017</a>). Genetic analyses based on S, M and N genes discovered contradic\u2010 tory results suggesting that Vietnam PDCoV could be a recombinant virus. However, the recombination of the virus has not been con\u2010 firmed and the full\u2010length genome was not attempt in the previous study. We therefore conducted a retrospective study investigating the presence of PDCoV in Vietnam, genetic diversity and character\u2010 ize the full\u2010length genome of detected PDCoV. The isolated chimeric virus was further evaluated for its pathogenicity.<br/><br/>In the present study, PDCoV was first detected in southern re\u2010 gion of Vietnam as early as 2014. The full\u2010length genome sequences of six Vietnam PDCoV isolates were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full\u2010length genome demonstrated that Vietnam PDCoV was genetically diverse. The six Vietnam PDCoV isolates were grouped in the SEA cluster together with the Vietnam (Hanoi/2015 and Binh21/2015), Thai and Lao PDCoV isolates which all have an amino acid deletion at positions 401 to 402 and 758 to 760 located in the ORF1a gene. However, the six Vietnam PDCoV isolates were separated into two sub\u2010clusters recognized as SEA\u20101 and SEA\u20102. Two of six isolates were clustered in SEA\u20101 together with Thai and Lao PDCoV isolates while other four isolates were clus\u2010 tered in SEA\u20102 together with Hanoi/2015 and Binh21/2015 isolates."

            "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an enveloped, positive\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA virus belonged to the genus Deltacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWoo_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rWoo_et+al_2010_a\">Woo, Huang, Lau, & Yuen, 2010</a>). PDCoV is the causative agent of a newly emerged enteric disease in pigs characterized by watery diarrhoea, dehydration and death with 40%\u201380% mortality following an outbreak (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJung_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rJung_et+al_2016_a\">Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2016</a>). PDCoV infects enterocytes of the small intestine lead\u2010 ing to villous atrophy and malabsorption (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHu_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rHu_et+al_2015_a\">Hu et al, 2015</a>; Jung et",
            "Transbound Emerg Dis. 2020;67:183\u2013198.",
            "SAENG\u2010CHUTO et al.",
            "al., 2015). Clinical signs caused by PDCoV resemble those with two viruses in the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, includ\u2010 ing porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gas\u2010 troenteritis virus (TGEV) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJung_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rJung_et+al_2015_a\">Jung et al, 2015</a>), but severity of clinical disease is lesser and piglet mortality is lower. PEDV and TGEV infect pigs of all ages and cause 100% morbidity, with 80%\u2013100% mortality rates in piglets. The higher severity of PEDV and TGEV infection in pigs indicates that the two viruses are more suitable for infecting pigs. On the other hand, PDCoV may not be perfectly adapted to pigs, and the virus may be evolving towards better ability to infect a specific host. Recently, an experimental study in calves suggested that calves are susceptible to infection by PDCoV but not PEDV (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJung_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rJung_et+al_2017_a\">Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2017</a>).",
            "The full\u2010length genome of PDCoV is approximately 25 kb in length and contains seven essential genes, including open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and specific accessory genes including non\u2010struc\u2010 tural protein 6 (Nsp6) and Nsp7, flanked by a 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010untranslated region (UTR) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWoo_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rWoo_et+al_2012_a\">Woo et al, 2012</a>). ORF1a and ORF1b, occupying two\u2010 thirds of the genome, encode 2 overlapping viral replicase/transcrip\u2010 tase polyproteins, 1a and 1b, which are cleaved into 15 Nsps, namely Nsp2\u201016 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhang_2016_a\" href=\"#rZhang_2016_a\">Zhang & Yoo, 2016</a>). The S gene encodes S protein which consists of two domains called S1 and S2 domain. The S1 domain plays an important role in binding to specific host cell receptors and contains a neutralizing epitope. The S2 domain functions in mem\u2010 brane fusion (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cShang_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rShang_et+al_2018_a\">Shang et al, 2018</a>). The E and M genes are transmem\u2010 brane proteins associated with viral envelope formation and virus release (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWoo_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rWoo_et+al_2010_a\">Woo et al, 2010</a>). On the other hand, the functions of the N gene are associated with viral RNA replication and pathogenesis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_2015_a\" href=\"#rLee_2015_a\">Lee & Lee, 2015</a>).",
            "PDCoV was first detected in Hong Kong (HKU15\u201044 and HKU15\u2010155 isolates) in 2012 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWoo_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rWoo_et+al_2012_a\">Woo et al, 2012</a>). Although it was first detected, there was no association with clinical disease. The first ev\u2010 idence of PDCoV causing a disease was first evident in Ohio, USA in 2014. Soon after the first emergence in Ohio, USA, the virus was then reported in 18 states (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJung_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rJung_et+al_2016_a\">Jung et al, 2016</a>). The rapid widespread of PDCoV was evident when the virus was subsequently reported in China, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam in 2015 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLe_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rLe_et+al_2018_a\">Le et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_2014_a\" href=\"#rLee_2014_a\">Lee & Lee, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMadapong_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rMadapong_et+al_2016_a\">Madapong et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMarthaler_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rMarthaler_et+al_2014_a\">Marthaler, Jiang, Collins, & Rossow, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSaeng\u2010Chuto_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rSaeng\u2010Chuto_et+al_2017_a\">Saeng\u2010Chuto, Lorsirigool, et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSong_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rSong_et+al_2015_a\">Song et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2014_a\">Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014a</a>, 2014b). Although the first detection of PDCoV in those countries was in 2014\u20132015, the retrospective investigation of intestinal samples demonstrated that the presence of PDCoV in China, USA and Thailand was as early as 2004, 2013 and 2013, respectively (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSaeng\u2010Chuto_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rSaeng\u2010Chuto_et+al_2017_a\">Saeng\u2010Chuto, Stott, et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSinha_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rSinha_et+al_2015_a\">Sinha, Gauger, Zhang, Yoon, & Harmon, 2015</a>).",
            "Presently, PDCoV has evolved into three separated groups, in\u2010 cluding US, China and Southeast Asia (SEA).

The phylogenetic analyses based on S and M genes demonstrated that Vietnam PDCoV is clustered in the SEA group. However, phylogenetic analysis based on the N gene demon\u2010 strated contradictory results, since Vietnam PDCoV was clustered in the US group. The findings implied that Vietnam PDCoV could potentially be a recombinant virus. Whether or not this genotype of PDCoV isolates predominantly existing in Vietnam remains not known. We therefore conducted a retrospective study investigating the presence of PDCoV in intestinal samples collected from pigs less than 5 days old experiencing severe diarrhoea, in Vietnam from 2011 to 2016. The full\u2010length genome sequences of the detected Vietnam PDCoV were further characterized on the basis of heterogenicity, and recombination analyses together with virus infectivity in cell cul\u2010 ture and pathogenicity in piglets were performed."

        "4 | DISCUSSION": [
            "In Vietnam, the first detection of PDCoV was reported in 2015 in the southern region of Vietnam (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSaeng\u2010Chuto_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rSaeng\u2010Chuto_et+al_2017_a\">Saeng\u2010Chuto, Lorsirigool, et al, 2017</a>). Genetic analyses based on S, M and N genes discovered contradic\u2010 tory results suggesting that Vietnam PDCoV could be a recombinant virus. However, the recombination of the virus has not been con\u2010 firmed and the full\u2010length genome was not attempt in the previous study. We therefore conducted a retrospective study investigating the presence of PDCoV in Vietnam, genetic diversity and character\u2010 ize the full\u2010length genome of detected PDCoV. The isolated chimeric virus was further evaluated for its pathogenicity.",
            "In the present study, PDCoV was first detected in southern re\u2010 gion of Vietnam as early as 2014. The full\u2010length genome sequences of six Vietnam PDCoV isolates were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full\u2010length genome demonstrated that Vietnam PDCoV was genetically diverse. The six Vietnam PDCoV isolates were grouped in the SEA cluster together with the Vietnam (Hanoi/2015 and Binh21/2015), Thai and Lao PDCoV isolates which all have an amino acid deletion at positions 401 to 402 and 758 to 760 located in the ORF1a gene. However, the six Vietnam PDCoV isolates were separated into two sub\u2010clusters recognized as SEA\u20101 and SEA\u20102. Two of six isolates were clustered in SEA\u20101 together with Thai and Lao PDCoV isolates while other four isolates were clus\u2010 tered in SEA\u20102 together with Hanoi/2015 and Binh21/2015 isolates.",
            "Due to a separated origin, the findings from the present study suggest there were at least 2 possible external introductions of PDCoV into Vietnam. As we mentioned earlier, the Vietnam PDCoV isolated in 2016 (P19_16_VN_0416 and P20_16_VN_0416) shares high degree of genetic similarities and was clustered to\u2010 gether with Thai and Lao PDCoV in subgroup SEA\u20101, the virus isolates might be introduced from these neighbouring countries. Secondly, the external introduction of US\u2010related PDCoV was also observed. This introduction seemed to influence the evo\u2010 lution of Vietnam PDCoV as evidenced by chimeric PDCoV in subgroup SEA\u20102. The Vietnam PDCoV isolates detected in 2014 (P12_VN_14_0814) were clustered together with other Vietnam PDCoV isolates, HaNoi6/2015 and Binh21/2015, in subgroup SEA\u20102. The HaNoi6/2014 isolate was detected in Ha Noi province in the northern region of Vietnam since October 2015 and consid\u2010 ered as recombinant virus between Thai and China isolates (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLe_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rLe_et+al_2018_a\">Le et al, 2018</a>). This study shows the P12_VN_14_0814 isolate shares 100% similarities with the HaNoi6/2014 isolate which means the P12_VN_14_0814 isolate could be also recombinant virus be\u2010 tween Thai and China isolates. Interestingly, three of other four isolates in subgroup SEA\u20102 were different. The P29_15_VN_1215, P30_15_VN_1215 and P1_16_VN_0116 isolates were confirmed to be chimeric virus which were a recombination between Vietnam PDCoV (P12_VN_14_0814), the major parent, and US PDCoV (USA/Minnesota159/2014), the minor parent. As previous reports, the recombination in RNA virus occurs when a host cell is infected with at least two viral genomes at the same time and affects host cell tropism, immune evasion, virulence and patho\u2010 genesis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMartin_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rMartin_et+al_2011_a\">Martin et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSimon\u2010Loriere_2011_a\" href=\"#rSimon\u2010Loriere_2011_a\">Simon\u2010Loriere & Holmes, 2011</a>). The findings in this study suggested that there are at least four differ\u2010 ent genome sequences of PDCoV currently circulating in swine",
            "To analyse the nt variation between chimeric Vietnam PDCoV isolates and their parents, the sliding window method was used. The results showed that high nt variation was detected in five sites of the full\u2010length genomes. Most nt variations occurred in the ORF1a/1b gene. One of the five sites was found in the S gene which encodes the S protein. The hydrophobicity and antigenicity variations of the S protein were then analysed. Hydrophobicity is associated with pro\u2010 tein\u2013protein interaction (e.g. ligand of virus\u2010host receptor binding) and can be changed by replacement with hydrophobic amino acids (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBosch_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rBosch_et+al_2003_a\">Bosch, Zee, Haan, & Rottier, 2003</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTekewe_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rTekewe_et+al_2016_a\">Tekewe, Connors, Middelberg, & Lua, 2016</a>), and change in antigenicity can affect immune re\u2010 sponse (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGroup_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rGroup_et+al_2012_a\">Group et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHe_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rHe_et+al_2006_a\">He, Li, Heck, Lustigman, & Jiang, 2006</a>). Differences in hydrophobicity and antigenicity were detected in six parts in the S1 domain (aa 1\u2013552) among the five isolates. The S1 domain plays an important role in host receptor binding and contains a neutralizing epitope (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cShang_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rShang_et+al_2018_a\">Shang et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWoo_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rWoo_et+al_2010_a\">Woo et al, 2010</a>). These results might support the proposition that the chimeric Vietnam PDCoV isolates are evolving towards improved host infection and immune response evasion.",
            "To investigate the infectivity of the chimeric Vietnam PDCoV (P29_15_VN_1215) isolate compared to the Thai isolate (NT1_1215), both virus isolates were propagated in ST cells. The viral growth curves were developed and compared to each other. The results showed that the growth curve of chimeric Vietnam PDCoV isolate (P29_15_VN_1215) in ST cells was relatively lower compared to the Thai isolate at 12\u201360 hpi. This finding suggested that the chimeric Vietnam PDCoV isolate (P29_15_VN_1215) had less infectivity in ST cells than the Thai isolate.",
            "To demonstrated whether or not this chimeric Vietnam PDCoV (P29_15_VN_1215) isolate can induce clinical disease, the virus was orally inoculated in piglets. Clinical diseases were compared to piglets that were orally inoculated with the Thai isolate. The re\u2010 sults demonstrated that both PDCoV isolates can induce clinical diseases and pathogenicity in piglets. V/C ratio of piglets infected with chimeric Vietnam PDCoV was reduced but not significant dif\u2010 ference compared to those of piglets infected with Thai PDCoV. The PDCoV infectivity results are in line with other studies. In 2015, two PDCoV isolates, OH\u2010FD22 and OH\u2010FD100, were also shown to cause disease. The infected gnotobiotic pigs showed severe diarrhoea, vomiting and severe atrophic enteritis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJung_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rJung_et+al_2015_a\">Jung et al, 2015</a>). Moreover, in 2018, piglets were challenged with PDCoV KNU16\u201007 isolate and showed similar clinical signs, namely diar\u2010 rhoea, vomiting and viral enteritis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJang_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rJang_et+al_2018_a\">Jang et al, 2018</a>). The findings in our study confirmed that the chimeric Vietnam PDCoV infection could induce small intestinal enteritis.",
            "In conclusion, Vietnam PDCoV is genetically diverse influencing from the external introduction. Vietnam PDCoV is further evolved into 2 separated subgroups including SEA\u20101 and SEA\u20102. Vietnam PDCoV in SEA\u20102 was closely related to Thai and Lao PDCoV.
