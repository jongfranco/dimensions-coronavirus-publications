Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China, now there are confirmed cases in multiple countries and there are many health care workers who have been infected while they were unprotected or improperly protected. As the 2019-nCoV is highly contagious and the transmission dynamics is still not fully understood [1], in large hospitals, such as Sichuan provincial people\u2019s hospital which has more than 4000 beds and a large number of outpatient visits every day, it was necessary to establish a hospital-specific protocol to deal with the new coronavirus infection.",

It is a huge challenge for all hospitals and medical staff. At the moment, controlling the source of infection and reducing the spread of infection are the most important issues. I believe that with everyone\u2019s efforts, we will be able to defeat the virus."

The enhanced biosafety secondary laboratory is particularly suitable for related operations that pose pathogenic microorganisms threats to humans or the environment. In addition, we have established a special radiology examination route to perform X-ray or CT examinations for highly suspected and confirmed patients, thus reducing the chance of crossinfection with other patients, and protecting the safety of medical staff. We used the ultrasound to evaluate the pulmonary disease, if necessary, so that we can reduce the risk of infection transmission among patients being transported"

            "January 17, 2020: the Sichuan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital officially launched the 2019 influenza emergency response plan and established a leading group for influenza prevention and control. The president of Sichuan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital serves as the team leader, and its members include related departments such as the administrative department, the intensive care unit, the infectious disease department, the respiratory department, nurses, the nosocomial infection control department and the radiology department. Afterwards we established multiple working groups: the emergency team, the prevention and control team, the medical emergency team, the material security team, the publicity and education team and the information updating team. Since the transmission dynamics were unclear, January 18, 2020: nosocomial infection control experts trained on isolation rules for highly contagious diseases. The infectious disease physician, the respiratory physician and an emergency medical physician became a fever diagnosis and screening team to triage the patients who have fever. The specific flowchart is shown in Fig. 1. For highly suspected patients, the rule is to enter the isolation ward and wait for the results of the New Coronavirus nucleic acid test and of the radiology examination. If the suspected patient is confirmed, then he enters the emergency ward for treatment. During the screening process, the medical staff must wear masks, wash their hands and put on isolation clothes to make sure not to be infected by 2019-nCoV carriers. The opening of the online clinics has reduced the number of common flu patients visiting hospitals, and consultation can be conducted at the online clinics.",
            "January 30, 2020: the hospital suspended all nonemergency patient admissions and stopped all nonemergency surgeries. The multiple departments were merged together, and the medical staff of the merged departments were on standby at home. The hospital was assigned to participate in the prevention and treatment of the new coronavirus epidemic. The objectives are: (1) to reduce the flow of personnel and reduce the chance of infection; (2) to save medical supplies and ensure that front-line medical staff who fight the 2019-nCoV have protective supplies available."
