The infant experienced no adverse effects, was virus free on day 20 of life, and discharged on day 30.3",
            "Perhaps of greater immediate concern in the United States is the treatment of season influenza. As of February 21, 2020, 342 women of childbearing age (15\u201344 years) had been hospitalized in the United States with influenza during the current flu season. Drugs used for influenza include the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir and the endonuclease inhibitor, baloxavir. All remain highly active against the strains that have been tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Oseltamivir is indicated only for influenza A, which is more common in adults than influenza B. Limited data indicate that oseltamivir and its active metabolite are poorly excreted into breast milk.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] Maternal dosages of 150 mg daily would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants. No studies have been done on zanamivir during breastfeeding, but it is estimated that an exclusively breastfed 5 kg infant would receive only about 0.075 mg/day orally in breast milk after an inhaled maternal dose of 10 mg, which is less than 1% of the inhaled pediatric dose. In addition, because zanamivir is poorly absorbed orally, it is not likely to reach the bloodstream of the infant in clinically important amounts.",
            "Peramivir is also poorly absorbed orally, and not likely to reach the bloodstream of the infant. Because baloxavir is 93% bound to plasma proteins, the amount in milk is likely to be low. However, because no information is available on the use of these two drugs during breastfeeding, oseltamivir and zanamivir are preferred.",
            "Many strains of influenza A are resistant to the older drugs amantadine and rimantadine. In addition, amantadine and possibly rimantadine, can suppress lactation by decreasing serum prolactin. These drugs should not be used to treat influenza."
