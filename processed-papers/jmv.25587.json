            "In conclusion, this study showed that HRV is the second most frequent virus causing childhood bronchiolitis in southeast China and induces Th1/Th2 response imbalance in children with bronchiolitis. HRV and RSV induce bronchiolitis and pneumonia; although having similar clinical characteristics, HRV induced bronchiolitis is more frequent in winter compared with RSV, and cases are more likely to present atopic dermatitis. Meanwhile, HRV pneumonia patients are more likely to have recurrent wheezing and fever than RSV cases. Further studies should consider the pathogenic mechanism of HRV induced wheezing and asthma development."

Inclusion criteria were: first clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis or pneumonia during the disease course; case requiring hospitalization. Patients were enrolled within 24 hours of admission, showing no underlying diseases, including asthma, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency disease, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Pneumonia was defined as acute respiratory infection with pulmonary infiltrates on chest X\u2010ray diagnosed by a radiologist. Bronchiolitis was diagnosed by the presence of wheezing combined with tachypnea, atelectasis, or peribronchial thickening on chest X\u2010ray in children aged \u22642 years. Ten healthy children without a history of recurrent wheezing and no respiratory infection symptoms within 2 weeks in the children's health clinics were recruited as a control group for cytokine detection.

Among all patients, there were 171 bronchiolitis and 164 pneumonia cases. A total of 223 (66.6%) cases had at least one respiratory virus, and cases with single virus detection were 158 (47.2%). HRV and RSV were found in 66 (19.7%) and 166, (49.6%) cases, respectively. Other viral pathogens detected included PIV (n = 73 cases or 21.8%, including 46 PIV3, 15 PIV4, 9 PIV1, and 3 PIV2), ADV (n = 70 cases, 20.9%), HMPV (n = 22 cases, 6.7%), HBOV (n = 19 cases, 5.7%), coronavirus (n = 12 cases or 3.6%, including 2 NL63 and 10 HKU1) and IFV (n = 8 cases or 2.4%, including 3 IFVA and 5 IFVB). Phylogenetic analysis of the coding regions of the viral proteins VP4\u2010VP2 in HRV infected patients revealed that 29 (44.0%), 1 (1.5%), and 36 (54.5%) cases had genotype A, B, C viruses, respectively. Among the 171 bronchiolitis cases, RSV was found in 94 (55.0%), followed by HRV which was detected in 35 patients (20.5%; 14 HRV\u2010A, 2 HRV\u2010B, and 19 HRV\u2010C).

        "discussion": [
            "This study revealed that HRV was the main virus associated with hospitalization in children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The clinical characteristics of these two diseases caused by HRV were similar to those of RSV, except for wheezing episodes, frequency of history of eczema, fever occurrence, and seasonal prevalence. Like RSV, HRV bronchiolitis presented an imbalanced Th1/Th2 immune response in the airway mucosa.<br/><br/>In the present study, HRV was found in 19.5% of children with lower respiratory infection (LRIs), and detection rates were similar in bronchiolitis (20.5%) and pneumonia (18.9%) cases. The results revealed that HRV is not only a major viral etiology of pneumonia but also the second leading cause of bronchiolitis after RSV, corroborating previous studies.2, 3, 17, 18 Unlike RSV, HRV showed similar incidence rates between the bronchiolitis and pneumonia cases. Many prospective long\u2010term studies have shown that RSV\u2010induced bronchiolitis is associated with later development of asthma.19, 20 However, a recent cohort study suggested that infants wheezing as a result of HRV infection may be at greater risk of subsequent asthma compared with RSV, PIV, and influenza virus\u2010infected counterparts.21 Therefore, HRV is not only a cause of lower respiratory tract illness but also represents a significant pathogen associated with wheezing, and routine detection of rhinovirus should be performed in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections, especially wheezing. Furthermore, HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C infection cases were much numerous than HRV\u2010B cases in both pneumonia and bronchiolitis groups. Previous research indicated that HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C infections were more prevalent than HRV\u2010B18, 22 and caused more severe respiratory illnesses.22, 23 Besides, Nakagome et al10 infected bronchial epithelial cells under air\u2010liquid interface conditions with rhinovirus and found that HRV\u2010B has slower replication and lower cellular cytotoxicity compared with HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C. This might explain why HRV\u2010B is detected at a lower frequency and causes a milder disease. Since single infections with different species had small sample sizes, we did not compare clinical characteristics among the HRV\u2010A, HRV\u2010B, and HRV\u2010C groups."

Children with a history of eczema, who did not present during the current illness were more likely to be infected with HRV than RSV (Pc = .000) and HRV + non\u2010RSV (Pd = .003) among bronchiolitis cases. Similar results were found in children with pneumonia (Pe = .033). Median length of hospital stay (LOS) values in HRV alone cases with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, respectively, were identical, that is, 8.5 days, and similar with those of other groups. LOS more than seven was not different in bronchiolitis and pneumonia cases among HRV alone and other viral groups (P > .05).

            "To assess the main Th1 and Th2 cytokines induced by HRV and RSV in children with bronchiolitis or pneumonia, we detected IL\u20102, IL\u20104, IL\u20106, IL\u201010, IFN\u2010\u03b3, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 in NPAs with Cytometric Bead Array. Median ages in the five groups were: control, 20 (6\u201046) months; RSV\u2010B, 8.9 (6\u201019) months; RSV\u2010P, 16 (1\u201056) months; HRV\u2010B, 8 (1\u201021) months; HRV\u2010P, 15 (1.8\u201075) months.

        "4 DISCUSSION": [
            "This study revealed that HRV was the main virus associated with hospitalization in children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The clinical characteristics of these two diseases caused by HRV were similar to those of RSV, except for wheezing episodes, frequency of history of eczema, fever occurrence, and seasonal prevalence. Like RSV, HRV bronchiolitis presented an imbalanced Th1/Th2 immune response in the airway mucosa.",
            "In the present study, HRV was found in 19.5% of children with lower respiratory infection (LRIs), and detection rates were similar in bronchiolitis (20.5%) and pneumonia (18.9%) cases. The results revealed that HRV is not only a major viral etiology of pneumonia but also the second leading cause of bronchiolitis after RSV, corroborating previous studies.2, 3, 17, 18 Unlike RSV, HRV showed similar incidence rates between the bronchiolitis and pneumonia cases. Many prospective long\u2010term studies have shown that RSV\u2010induced bronchiolitis is associated with later development of asthma.19, 20 However, a recent cohort study suggested that infants wheezing as a result of HRV infection may be at greater risk of subsequent asthma compared with RSV, PIV, and influenza virus\u2010infected counterparts.21 Therefore, HRV is not only a cause of lower respiratory tract illness but also represents a significant pathogen associated with wheezing, and routine detection of rhinovirus should be performed in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections, especially wheezing. Furthermore, HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C infection cases were much numerous than HRV\u2010B cases in both pneumonia and bronchiolitis groups. Previous research indicated that HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C infections were more prevalent than HRV\u2010B18, 22 and caused more severe respiratory illnesses.22, 23 Besides, Nakagome et al10 infected bronchial epithelial cells under air\u2010liquid interface conditions with rhinovirus and found that HRV\u2010B has slower replication and lower cellular cytotoxicity compared with HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C. This might explain why HRV\u2010B is detected at a lower frequency and causes a milder disease. Since single infections with different species had small sample sizes, we did not compare clinical characteristics among the HRV\u2010A, HRV\u2010B, and HRV\u2010C groups.",
            "Previous data have revealed that HRVs circulate year\u2010round and prevail in fall and winter.18, 24, 25 The seasonal distributions of HRVs vary according to the geographic area as well as the resulting disease. This study showed that HRV\u2010induced pneumonia and bronchiolitis were prevalent in winter and spring. HRV\u2010C incidence peaked in winter and late spring months, while HRV\u2010A was detected mainly during the autumn and spring months, in general agreement with findings by others.5, 9 Previous studies reported that the seasonal distributions of HRVs are consistent with asthma occurrence in hospitalized children,26 and indicated that HRV infection is more likely to cause severe illness in winter than other seasons.23 This study demonstrated that the epidemic seasons of HRV were predominantly in winter and spring months, which accorded with the episodes of most bronchiolitis and pneumonia cases. Therefore, rhinovirus is an important pathogen causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children in winter and spring.",
            "In the present study, mean ages and age distributions were similar among the HRV alone and RSV alone groups, which is consistent with previous studies27, 28, but in contrast with the finding that patients with HRV\u2010induced lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) tend to be older than RSV cases.29 This may be related to different study designs. Patients with HRV single infection presented more often a history of eczema than the RSV and HRV + non\u2010RSV groups, which accorded with findings in a multicenter study.6 Furthermore, the COAST study evaluated the relationship between HRV illness and allergic sensitization and showed that allergic sensitization may precede rhinovirus associated wheezing but not RSV infection.30 This may be partly explained by that more and more children develop allergies with age, which makes them more sensitive to HRV infection.",
            "In this research, HRV was the second most frequent virus detected in bronchiolitis cases. HRV single infection patients with pneumonia were more likely to have a history of wheezing compared with the RSV single infection and HRV + non\u2010RSV infection. An Italian cohort study showed that the rate of recurrent wheezing is higher after hospitalization with HRV bronchiolitis than with other respiratory viruses during a 1\u2010year follow\u2010up period.31 Moreover, a study performed in the United States demonstrated that HRV wheezing in the first 3 years of life is a much stronger risk factor for asthma development at the age of 6 years compared with RSV associated wheezing or aeroallergen sensitization.32 Taken together, HRV infection in early life is a major risk factor for recurrent wheezing disease and asthma development. Compared with children infected with RSV alone, cases with HRV alone and HRV coinfection had similar LOS values. Meanwhile, supplemental oxygen and tachypnea were not different among the HRV single infection and the other three groups. Our findings corroborated studies performed in Netherland and Spain,27, 33 but were in contrast with previous reports showing that hospital duration in children with HRV single infection is shorter7 or longer than 28 that of children with RSV infection. Patients with HRV single infection had a higher frequency of fever and slightly elevated leucocyte amounts in HRV\u2010infected patients with pneumonia compared with the RSV and HRV + RSV groups, similar to findings by O. Adams.17 This might be associated with large amounts of IL\u20108 released during HRV infection; IL\u20108 is known as a neutrophil chemotactic factor and induces chemotaxis in neutrophils and other granulocytes.34 Of note, pneumonia cases associated with HRV + non\u2010RSV infection frequently presented in summer, which may be due to viruses other than HRV and RSV. HRV single infection\u2010induced bronchiolitis more likely in winter than the other three infection groups, indicating that rhinovirus is an important pathogen that causes bronchiolitis in winter.",
            "Although previous reports have shown virus detection and cytokine profiles in virus\u2010induced acute wheezing,35, 36 we assessed Th1 and Th2\u2010type cytokines secreted by patients with bronchiolitis and pneumonia caused by HRV and RSV. We found that both Th1\u2010type (IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u20102, and TNF\u2010\u03b1) and Th2\u2010type (IL\u20104, IL\u20106, and IL\u201010) cytokines significantly increased in HRV or RSV infected patients with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Previous studies demonstrated that HRV infection causes a massive upregulation of inflammatory mediators in the host,37 and Th2\u2010type cytokines may reflect a chronic inflammation of the lower respiratory tract.38 Th2\u2010type cytokines such as IL\u20104, IL\u20105, IL\u201010, and IL\u201013 favor HRV infection by increasing the expression of ICAM\u20101.34 A research in the UK demonstrated that the IL\u20104/IFN\u2010\u03b3 ratio in infants with acute bronchiolitis elevated in nasal lavage fluid sample on both days 1 to 2 and days 5 to 7 of disease compared with infants suffering from upper respiratory tract infection alone.39 Moreover, a recent study showed that the majority of HRV\u2010infected infants display a high Th2 response, while the majority of RSV\u2010infected infants show a Type\u20101 response.40 In the current study, Th2/Th1 ratios were higher in HRV and RSV associated bronchiolitis compared with pneumonia and control cases, reflected by increased IL\u20104/IFN\u2010\u03b3 and decreased TNF\u2010\u03b1/IL\u201010 ratios, which suggested that excessive Th2 or deficient Th1 response may be associated with the pathogenesis of HRV bronchiolitis. The reason why IL\u20106/IL\u20102 ratios were not significantly different between bronchiolitis and pneumonia cases in both HRV and RSV groups is difficult to explain. However, it may be explained by that IL\u20106 represents a potent mediator of cellular communication, is crucial for the regulation of innate and adaptive inflammatory responses,41 and is positively associated with illness severity in RSV and HRV associated lower respiratory tract infection.42, 43 Taken together, an imbalanced Th1/Th2 response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HRV bronchiolitis and may be one of the reasons for asthma development.",
            "This study has potential limitations. First, we did not test concurrent healthy controls to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic rhinovirus shedding. Another limitation is the low number of subjects in the virus groups and cytokine detection assays since the cases recruited had single virus infections and similar backgrounds.",
            "In conclusion, this study showed that HRV is the second most frequent virus causing childhood bronchiolitis in southeast China and induces Th1/Th2 response imbalance in children with bronchiolitis. HRV and RSV induce bronchiolitis and pneumonia; although having similar clinical characteristics, HRV induced bronchiolitis is more frequent in winter compared with RSV, and cases are more likely to present atopic dermatitis. Meanwhile, HRV pneumonia patients are more likely to have recurrent wheezing and fever than RSV cases. Further studies should consider the pathogenic mechanism of HRV induced wheezing and asthma development."
