The novel coronavirus has the characteristics of rapid transmission, atypical clinical symptoms, and easy to affect both lungs, leading to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis, as well as difficult to detection and assessment at early stage. Fever, cough, myalgia, weakness, dyspnea and imagings may be helpful for the early detection of novel coronavirus pneumonia. At the same time, the rate of disease progression, fever, CT manifestations, hypoxia degree, age, basic diseases, and laboratory indicators can also be used to evaluate the severity of the novel coronavirus pneumonia."
