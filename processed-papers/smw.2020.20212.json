        "abstract": "Almost half of the confirmed COVID-19 cases detected so far in the United Kingdom are part of a large cluster of 13 British nationals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, Spain, and France. Transmissions among this cluster occurred at a ski resort in France, and originated from a single infected traveller returning from a conference in Singapore where he acquired the virus. At least 21 individuals were exposed to the virus, tested, and quarantined, with 13 of those testing positive between the period of 6th February and 15th February. Here, all publicly available information about the primarily UK/France cluster is consolidated, providing a complete and accessible summary of the cases and their connections. Notable in this cluster are the number of individuals infected, the apparent absence of any severe illness among those infected, and a case of a \u201cdelayed positive\u201d test during isolation after initially testing negative, at least 7 days after last possible contact.",

            "In December of 2019, a new virus, later named SARSCoV-2, was identified among pneumonia patients in Wuhan, a city in the Chinese province of Hubei [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, can cause serious and fatal respiratory illness, but can also manifest with mild or no symptoms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. One recent study of over 70,000 patients in China suggests that approximately 80% of the cases have been mild [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Recent studies have indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be transmissible during the incubation period, before patients display symptoms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], which has been reported in individual cases outside of China. Though primarily a respiratory illness, at least one study has suggested the virus may also be transmissible through the oral-faecal route [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].<br/><br/>As of 24 February, there are over 77,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 2,500 deaths due to the virus in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], and COVID-19 cases have been detected in 29 countries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Outside of China, onward transmission of the virus has been reported in multiple countries, such as Singapore ([<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], with data from [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]), Japan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], South Korea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], and Germany [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].

        "conclusion": [
            "In total, twenty-one people are known to be associated with the cluster of COVID-19 cases transmitted in France and later detected in France, the UK, and Spain. Including index case \u201cAUK\u201d, thirteen of those people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Encouragingly, none of the individuals involved have suffered from any form of severe symptoms; some seem to have perhaps had entirely asymptomatic infections. However, the fact that an asymptomatic or nearly asymptomatic index case could have transmitted the infection to so many people raises concerns about the feasibility of containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Exact ages were not available for most of the individuals in the cluster, but of those whose ages are known, none are over 60, suggesting the group is not within the age cohort most at risk.<br/><br/>The lack of detail on the type and duration of contact the individuals at the ski resort in Contamines-Monjoie is unfortunate. While it seems some individuals (those isolated in France on the 7th February, and presumably \u201cJUK\u201d) were sharing apartments within the chalet, for most of the cases detected outside of France, including \u201cAUK\u201d, the spatial and temporal overlap with other cases, or with \u201cAUK\u201d, is unknown."

Outside of China, onward transmission of the virus has been reported in multiple countries, such as Singapore ([<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], with data from [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]), Japan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], South Korea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], and Germany [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].

The exposure, timelines, contacts, and symptoms of the first three cases of COVID-19 in France have been described in detail [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>].",

The apparent asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic transmission from the primary case to at least four German individuals in a business setting drew new attention to the transmissibility of the virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. From January 28th to February 6th, a further eight people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, all stemming from these initial infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "In Singapore, a large conference at the end of January sparked worldwide attention when it was found to be source of SARS-CoV-2 infection not only for attendees, but multiple onward contacts.

The conference, at the Grand Hyatt hotel from 20 to 22 or 23 January, was hosted by a gas analysis company [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. It was attended by 109 delegates, 94 of whom came from outside of Singapore, including one attendee from Wuhan, the city in China at the center of the outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. The conference was the source of a number of infections: as of 9 February, seven attendees had tested positive for the virus in Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, and the UK [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>].",

The fifth patient who had been held there, described elsewhere as a \u201csingle man\u201d who tested negative on the 8th February [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>], was also released [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>]. As of the 18th February, four cases were reported to remain hospitalised in France: three in Lyon and one in Saint-Etienne [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>]. It is unclear whether the patients who remain hospitalised are those who tested positive or negative on the 8th February, though it presumably includes the patient diagnosed on the 15th. Details ofwhich patients have already been released, and when this occurred, are also unclear."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "In total, twenty-one people are known to be associated with the cluster of COVID-19 cases transmitted in France and later detected in France, the UK, and Spain. Including index case \u201cAUK\u201d, thirteen of those people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Encouragingly, none of the individuals involved have suffered from any form of severe symptoms; some seem to have perhaps had entirely asymptomatic infections. However, the fact that an asymptomatic or nearly asymptomatic index case could have transmitted the infection to so many people raises concerns about the feasibility of containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Exact ages were not available for most of the individuals in the cluster, but of those whose ages are known, none are over 60, suggesting the group is not within the age cohort most at risk.",
            "The lack of detail on the type and duration of contact the individuals at the ski resort in Contamines-Monjoie is unfortunate. While it seems some individuals (those isolated in France on the 7th February, and presumably \u201cJUK\u201d) were sharing apartments within the chalet, for most of the cases detected outside of France, including \u201cAUK\u201d, the spatial and temporal overlap with other cases, or with \u201cAUK\u201d, is unknown.",
            "The delayed positive test from \u201cNFr\u201d is worth mentioning again. As \u201cNFr\u201d was isolated on the night of the 7th February, along with all the other chalet residents, there is uncommon certainty that \u201cNFr\u201d had no further contacts after this point. \u201cNFr\u201d was also closely monitored and regularly tested, presumably continuing to test negative until the 15th February, when positive test was announced. The last possible contact with another person who tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus was on 7th February, though \u201cNFr\u201d could have become infected some days before that \u2012 even earlier if they were infected directly from \u201cAUK\u201d, who departed France on the 28th Jan. This thus is a very reliable case, due to the isolation, showing the incubation period can be at least 7 days, and possibly longer.",
            "Cluster and case descriptions like this one can provide valuable insights into what kinds and duration of contact seem to be conducive to the spread of SARS-COV-2. They also outline possible ranges of symptoms, and may be a source of information on whether symptoms are necessary for the virus to spread, and what kind of symptoms may facilitate transmission. Finally, thorough case and cluster descriptions are valuable as a pool of more accessible information for other scientists to use to include in larger studies and investigations, providing condensed, usable data that can more easily be understood and built upon.",
