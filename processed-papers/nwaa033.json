            "In summary, our results demonstrate that AAV-mediated delivery of CasRx can potently knockdown Vegfa mRNA and suppress pathogenic CNV development in a mouse model of AMD, supporting the notion that RNA-targeting CRISPR system could be useful for therapeutic purposes. The small size of CasRx is suitable for packaging with multiple gRNAs in a single AAV vector for in vivo delivery. Notably, AAV-delivered CasRx has the potential for sustained corrective effects on protein expression for up to 2 years with a single injection14. The risks associated with mRNA editing could be lower than that of DNA editing, because of the existence of large number of transcripts, many of which may maintain normal functions. Thus CasRx knockdown approach could complement existing therapeutic strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides and DNA nuclease editing. Intriguingly, a recent study demonstrated that Cas13 showed potent activity against RNA viruses15. In the future, it is promising to examine whether CasRx could be used to inhibit the reproduction of recently emerged deadly RNA viruses such as 2019-nCoV, Ebola, MERS and Zika."

            "crucial role in CNV pathogenesis and anti-VEGFA therapy using humanized antibodies has been widely used in treating AMD, with the therapeutic effects maintained by regular injections of antibodies2,3. Two recent studies showed that in a mouse model of AMD that permanent Vegfa gene disruption could be induced by spCas9 or LbCpf1 editing4,5. However, risks associated with permanent DNA modifications, including unwanted off-target and on-target effects, need to be considered6,7.",
            "The Cas13 protein family was recently shown to be a programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR system8-13, which could mediated RNA knockdown with high efficiency and specificity relative to other existing RNA interference approaches8,9,12. Several Cas13 proteins have been identified, among which CasRx (also named RfxCas13d) has the smallest size and highest RNase activity12. Here, we examine the potential application of CasRx system for in vivo gene therapy, using a laser-induced mouse model of AMD. Our results show that adeno-associated viral (AAV)-delivered CasRx could knockdown Vegfa transcripts efficiently, resulting in the significant reduction of CNV area in this AMD model."
