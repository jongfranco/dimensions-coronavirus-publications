            "The new coronavirus identified from a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, has become a widespread public-health concern. The timing of the outbreak is particularly unfortunate as it coincides with the peak of a virulent season of flu, which has caused thousands of death worldwide. A case of flu in China, which should be rather common, now comes with a degree of anxiety or panic, exerting further strains on the medical system."
