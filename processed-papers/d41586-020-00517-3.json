            "High-resolution satellite data and big-data analytics are revolutionizing our ability to monitor crop development at field level worldwide (see, for example, J. Dash Nature Sustain. 2, 903\u2013904; 2019). However, progress towards ensuring food security for all with the aid of satellite technology is hampered by poor access to ground data, leaving untapped opportunities to improve human livelihoods. The solution could lie in stronger public\u2013 private partnerships between the academic and corporate sectors.",
            "The high costs of ground-data collection, and researchers\u2019 general isolation from farmers, can make stand-alone projects impractical. In many countries, however, ground data are already being collected at field level by insurers, traders, seed companies and representatives of other industries. Crosssectoral collaborations could benefit all parties if concerns around data sharing, cited by both private and public organizations, could be resolved and mutual trust reinforced.",
            "Public\u2013private partnerships stand to optimize the value of input and expertise from both sectors, thereby accelerating innovation and informatics related to sustainable and productive agriculture.",
            "On the basis of a preliminary input\u2013output analysis, we suggest that China\u2019s countermeasures and the resilience of suppressed demand could limit the long-term economic impact of the current coronavirus outbreak. In the short term, however, we estimate that the most sensitive sectors \u2014 transportation, tourism, retail and entertainment \u2014 could lose up to 18% of their usual output (see go.nature.com/3bxqzjm).",
            "China hosts more than 18 million small and mediumsized enterprises. These have been severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak because they account for almost 80% of enterprise jobs and 50% of private firms\u2019 exports. Widespread production disruption, surging inventory costs from depressed domestic consumption and rigid expenditure on rents, wages and interest are all hitting the fragile capital chain of these businesses. This could result in waves of bank failures.",
            "The Chinese government has made swift and decisive efforts to control the virus\u2019s spread, and international aid has exceeded expectations. Depending on the time it takes for the outbreak to peak, measures that could mitigate short-term economic risks include campaigns to promote small enterprises, policy incentives such as financial subsidies, delayed tax payments or reduced mortgage interest, and restoring market confidence through greater publicity and public scrutiny.",

            "Last December, the Chinese city of Wuhan signed an agreement with the communications giant Huawei to install infrastructure to enhance its security and information services and convert it into a \u2018smart city\u2019. The agreement also incorporates mechanisms for swift emergency responses, which could, in principle, help in containing the city\u2019s epidemic of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 (see go.nature. com/2uczxpm). Other cities might consider adopting similar measures for the timely prevention and control of infectious-disease outbreaks.",
