        "abstract": "Fast point-of-use detection of, for example, early-stage zoonoses, e.g., Q-fever, bovine tuberculosis, or the Covid-19 coronavirus, is beneficial for both humans and animal husbandry as it can save lives and livestock. The latter prevents farmers from going bankrupt after a zoonoses outbreak. This paper describes the development of a fabrication process and the proof-of-principle of a disposable DNA amplification chip with an integrated heater. Based on the analysis of the milling process, metal adhesion studies, and COMSOL MultiPhysics heat transfer simulations, the first batch of chips has been fabricated and successful multiple displacement amplification reactions are performed inside these chips. This research is the first step towards the development of an early-stage zoonoses detection device. Tests with real zoonoses and DNA specific amplification reactions still need to be done.",

            "Diseases were and can still be a major problem in the world. Examples are outbreaks of zoonoses. One very recent example is the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Zoonoses are also a widespread problem in animal husbandry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. This group encompasses diseases which can be transferred between animals (usually vertebrates) and between animals and humans. They are transmitted through zoonotic agents (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Examples of bacterial zoonoses are the infections caused by Coxiella burnetii (Q-fever), Mycobacterium bovis (bovine tuberculosis), and by species of the Salmonella (Salmonellosis), Campylobacter (Campylobacteriosis), and Escherichia (Escherichiasis) genus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. These diseases are of potential risk for humans and livestock of farms. Poon et al show that early-stage detection of coronaviruses positively influence the survival chances of patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. An outbreak among the livestock of a farm is often disastrous to the owner of that farm, and for people living in the proximity of that farm [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Often, more animals of the livestock are infected and the whole livestock is exterminated out of precaution, which could lead to bankruptcy of the farmer. Therefore, early-stage detection of this group of diseases, and other diseases as well, is often the key to save lives and livestock. As these diseases are also encountered at remote locations and in"

            "<strong>Design and Fabrication</strong><br/><br/>2.1. Microfluidic Structure Design<br/><br/>The microfluidic structure consists of two chambers, i.e., a reaction chamber and a temperature monitor chamber. In Figure 2, a close-up of the final chip is shown. For clarity reasons, the two microfluidic structures are colored with food coloring dye. The reaction chamber is based on the work of Bruijns et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] and its dimensions are chosen in such way that the internal volume of the reaction chamber is the same as the reaction volume of the used Illustra GenomiPhi V2 DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) together with the EvaGreen dye solution (Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA), while maintaining an as low as possible surface-area-to-volume ratio [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]. Using SolidWorks 2018 computer-aided design (CAD) software (Dassault Systemes, V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France), the 3D image of the chip is drawn and with the use of the AutoDesk HSMWorks computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) plug-in (Autodesk Inc., San Rafael, CA, USA), this image is transferred into a computer numerical control (CNC) milling code. The total chip size is 3 cm by 3 cm and contains an inlet and outlet of 1.5 mm diameter. The inlet and outlet are of such size that the reaction chamber can be filled using pipette tips. In between the inlet and outlet, a rectangular reaction chamber of 10 mm by 3 mm is located. Two trapezoid structures are placed in the tapered channels between the inlet/outlet and the chamber. The function of these trapezoids is twofold: First, they minimize the dead volume between the inlet/outlet and the reaction chamber, locating as much as possible of the reaction mixture inside the chamber. Second, they provide support for the chamber closure. A stadium-shaped channel of 1.5 mm wide and 1.0 mm deep is located next to the reaction chamber, in such way that this channel is also covered by the heater. This channel serves as temperature monitor chamber. A thermocouple is inserted in this channel for real-time monitoring of the temperature inside the chip. This way, a more accurate temperature of the reaction mixture inside the chip can be obtained. Via a feedback loop, the input potential can be changed when required. In Figure 3, the SolidWorks design of the chamber-based chip with both chambers is shown. In Figure A1, in Appendix A, the technical drawing of the chip can be found."

            "<strong>Results and Discussion</strong><br/><br/>3.1. COMSOL MultiPhysics Simulation Results<br/><br/>In Figure 5, the results of heat transfer simulations of two different heater spacings are shown. The heater width for both geometries is 0.3 mm, while the heater spacing in Figure 5b,c are 0.3 mm and 2.0 mm, respectively. In Figure 6a\u2013d, tables with the results of the full parametric sweep for different heater widths and heater spacings are shown. Figure 6a shows the temperature deviation between the highest and lowest temperature at the top of the chamber, i.e., the second H2O and COC interface (\u2206Ttop of chamber = Ttop,max \u2212 Ttop,min). Figure 6b shows the deviation between the highest and lowest temperature inside the chamber, i.e., between the two COC and H2O interfaces (\u2206Tacross chamber = Tbottom,max \u2212 Ttop,min). Figure 6c shows the temperature deviation between the highest and lowest temperature at the bottom of the chamber, i.e., the first COC and H2O interface (\u2206Tbottom of chamber = Tbot,max \u2212 Tbot,min). Figure 6d shows the deviation between the set heater temperature of 30 \u25e6C and the lowest temperature at the top of the chamber, i.e., the second H2O and COC interface (\u2206Tdeviation from set T = Theater \u2212 Ttop,min). As can be seen from the results in Figure 6, a combination of small heater widths and heater spacings will result in smaller temperature differences inside the reaction mixture. This is evident as smaller heater spacings will result in a better coverage of the heated area by heater material. The smaller heater widths will result in a smaller heater cross-sectional area, and thus can be operated at lower powers, as is evident from Equation (1). Resulting in the fact that a densely packed meander structure with small heater widths and small heater spacings can dissipate more heat into the system."

In this case there is no interest in quantification of the DNA, but only in amplification of DNA until the detection threshold is reached. As proof-of-principle the MDA reaction and ex-situ fluorescence measurements were used.<br/><br/>With the proposed fabrication process, low-cost and biocompatible chips (Figure 12b) were fabricated. The integrated resistive heaters on the chips were characterized and showed a temperature stability of \u00b12 \u25e6C over a time period of 25 h, which is at least twelve-fold longer than the required operating times for DNA amplification reactions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].

            "Diseases were and can still be a major problem in the world. Examples are outbreaks of zoonoses. One very recent example is the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Zoonoses are also a widespread problem in animal husbandry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. This group encompasses diseases which can be transferred between animals (usually vertebrates) and between animals and humans. They are transmitted through zoonotic agents (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Examples of bacterial zoonoses are the infections caused by Coxiella burnetii (Q-fever), Mycobacterium bovis (bovine tuberculosis), and by species of the Salmonella (Salmonellosis), Campylobacter (Campylobacteriosis), and Escherichia (Escherichiasis) genus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. These diseases are of potential risk for humans and livestock of farms. Poon et al show that early-stage detection of coronaviruses positively influence the survival chances of patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. An outbreak among the livestock of a farm is often disastrous to the owner of that farm, and for people living in the proximity of that farm [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Often, more animals of the livestock are infected and the whole livestock is exterminated out of precaution, which could lead to bankruptcy of the farmer. Therefore, early-stage detection of this group of diseases, and other diseases as well, is often the key to save lives and livestock. As these diseases are also encountered at remote locations and in",

            "Micromachines 2020, 11, 238 developing countries, it is desired that such detection equipment is portable and as cheap as possible. A lab-on-a-chip platform can be used for this early-stage detection.",
            "In the early stage of diseases, the agent, and therefore its genetic material, is only present in low concentrations within the infected human or animal, making detection rather difficult. One way to overcome this low concentration is to amplify the genetic material of the agent, i.e., deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in case of bacteria and DNA or ribonucleic acid (RNA) in case of viruses, until a certain threshold is reached and detection of the disease is made possible. When this amplification reaction is specific to certain DNA or RNA sequences, for example, by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], and when a fluorescent DNA or RNA binding dye is used, a simple yes-or-no answer for a specific disease can be obtained."
        ],
        "1.1. State-of-the-Art": [
            "In the past, several chip-based DNA and RNA amplification devices are reported. It goes beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the state-of-the-art of DNA amplification chips in-depth. There are several good review papers written on this topic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Readers are referred to these for a comprehensive overview of the field. In this paper, the state-of-the-art is divided into several discussion points, i.e., the heating method, the temperature control method, and the substrate material and fabrication technique. These points will be discussed separately.",
            "With respect to heat supply, different methods have been employed. Almassian et al give a comprehensive overview of different possible heating methods in their review paper [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Not all of the mentioned methods are easy to implement in low-cost and portable lab-on-a-chip devices due to their bulkiness or implementation costs. Examples of these rather difficult methods are using heating via induction, infrared, or microwave radiation. Others are not useful due ot their challenging temperature control, like with heating up the system using exothermic reactions. Within the field of DNA amplification, different mechanisms of amplification exist. Some are based on thermo cycling processes, e.g., PCR, whereas others are isothermal. The use of an isothermal amplification technique puts less requirements on the heaters. Isothermal processes are either truly isothermal or consisting of three different temperatures, as they have a thermal denaturation step before and a termination step after the elongation step. The switching between these temperature steps does not have to be as fast as with thermal cycling steps in, for example, PCR amplification reactions. The use of less temperature variations makes it easier to maintain the set temperature as there is less heating an cooling involved. Furthermore, it eliminates the use of a continuous flow approach in systems with low thermal conductivities, e.g., polymers. Therefore, it is easier to implement within lab-on-a-chip devices [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Isothermal DNA amplification reactions can already be performed by putting the chip on a commercially available hotplate [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] or Peltier elements [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. However, these heating systems are bulky and power-consuming. Therefore, they are not useful for portable equipment or operation at remote locations. Miniaturizing heaters lowers the bulkiness and power consumption. Miniaturized heaters can be integrated as integrated resistive heaters, e.g., as deposited thin-film metal [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] or as laminated Cu foil [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>], or as micro-Peltier elements [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. These miniaturized heaters can be implemented directly onto the microfluidic chip [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] or on a different substrate and leter incorporated onto the microfluidic chip [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. The geometry of such a heater contributes significantly to the uniformity of the heat distribution within the chip [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. One method to accurately control the temperature is the use of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controlled thermostat. These PID controllers are coupled to the electrical heaters and use a thermocouple as feedback-loop to the controller [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>].",
            "There are various materials that can be used to fabricate lab-on-a-chip devices for DNA or RNA amplification. In the past 15 years, more than ten polymers, ceramic materials, and metals have successfully been used to fabricate such devices [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. The major property playing a role here is the biocompatibility of the material. The surface of the microfluidic structure should not inhibit the amplification reaction. This biocompatibility can be an intrinsic property of the material or the surface can be modified or coated to achieve this [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. One often used material is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>], which can be processed using soft lithography [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. However, this is a fabrication technology used in academia and is not suitable for upscaling to mass production [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. Fabrication methods suitable for mass production are thermoforming/embossing or injection molding [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. One of the materials which is biocompatible and suitable for both industrial scale fabrication technologies is cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>], which is one of the materials used in the past as well [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. Guckenberger et al estimates the costs of injection molding of only 50 simple microfluidic devices on $47, but this becomes cheaper when the mass production stage is reached [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. Another benefit of COC is the possibility to shape it using micromilling. This technique is a rapid prototyping technology and therefore very useful within proof-of-concept projects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>].",
            "Integrating resistive metal tracks onto a COC substrate have also been done in the past. Some papers describe the use of a surface modification step done before metal deposition in order to enhance adhesion between the COC and the metal layer, like a pretreatment with plasma [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>] or an organic solvent [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. Other papers describe the direct deposition of metal onto the COC surface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]. Chung et al specifically, fabricated an amplification chip in COC with integrated Au heaters [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. However, their system required heating from both sides as the used grade of COC has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 130 \u25e6C. This COC could not withstand the required heater temperatures to have enough heat flux into the system. They had to heat up the heater to temperatures above 130 \u25e6C, which caused cracking of the heater tracks due to deformation of the COC. With their double-sided heating they ensured that the reaction mixture had the desired PCR temperatures. However, double-sided heating doubles the amount of metal required, increases the amount of fabrication steps, and therefore increases the price per chip."

        "1.2. The Presented Work": [
            "The work presented at the 4th Microfluidic Handling Systems conference and which is extended in this paper aims at the development of a disposable, polymer-based DNA amplification lab-on-chip system with integrated resistive heater based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Sexually Transmitted Diseases Diagnostics Initiative (SDI) ASSURED criteria. Devices which are ASSURED are (A) affordable, (S) sensitive, (S) specific, (U) user-friendly, (R) robust and rapid, (E) equipment-free, and (D) deliverable to those who need them [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>]. The first step towards such a device is the development of the chip itself. This paper focuses on the choice of substrate material, metal deposition method, and type of metal. Although, it is mentioned above that PCR and HDA are sequence specific, the reaction chosen is the isothermal multiple displacement amplification (MDA) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]. This reaction is more straightforward [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>], as it amplifies any present DNA, and is therefore better suitable as a proof-of-principle amplification reaction to show the functioning of the integrated heater and the biocompatibility of the substrate after the fabrication process. The use of an isothermal amplification technique also simplifies the final device and lowers its footprint, as there are no pumps required. In this research, external analysis methods are used which do not contribute to the WHO-SDI ASSURED criteria due to their bulkiness, costs, and difficulty. However, suggestions and comments on the integration of low-cost detection methods, which are ASSURED, are given in Section 5."
        ],
        "1.3. Multiple Displacement Amplification": [
            "The proof-of-principle amplification of choice is a MDA reaction, which is a non-specific isothermal method of amplification performed around 30 \u25e6C [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]. MDA is a method of whole genome amplification (WGA), as it amplifies all present DNA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>]. It is commonly used when the initial amount of DNA sample is very low. After the WGA is performed, a sequence specific amplification can be done since the quality the amplified DNA by MDA is very high [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. The amplification reaction is illustrated below in Figure 1 (the contour of the amplified sequence is highlighted in black for clarity). Starting with a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule, a denaturation step at 95 \u25e6C is required, giving the random hexamer-primers and the \u03c629 DNA polymerase access to the bases of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) strands. The hexamers anneal themself to aleatory parts of the ssDNA sequence. These hexamers work as initiation sites for the \u03c629 DNA polymerases. After denaturation at 95 \u25e6C, the mixture is cooled down to ice temperature and the rest of the reagents are added. The mixture is heated up to ~30 \u25e6C so the polymerase starts to complete the complementary ssDNA sequence, creating again a dsDNA strand, eventually it encounters a hexamer from another annealing site. Once this happens the polymerase will lift up that hexamer and starts to separate the amplified sequence formed from that annealing site. As the polymerase displaces the formed strand ahead of it, it continues to complete the sequence. The displaced strand becomes a new ssDNA strand and therefore, it gives new sites for more primers to attach and initiation sites for the polymerase, continuing the amplification, and thus creating a web of DNA strands. Finally, the inactivation of the polymerase is done by heating up the system to 65 \u25e6C.",
            "Even though MDA is considered an isothermal process, prior to the reaction and to the addition of most reactants, the dsDNA and a buffer are heated up to 95 \u25e6C to denature the dsDNA to ssDNA and to give hexamers the initial access to the ssDNA. After the amplification reaction, the polymerase has to be inactivated at 65 \u25e6C. However, this does not require fast temperature changes, as would be the case with, for example, the temperature cycling in PCR amplifications. This, together with the robustness of the amplification (it is a self-limiting reaction that amplifies all present DNA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]) makes MDA perfectly suitable as proof-of-principle amplification reaction for such devices."

            "The microfluidic structure consists of two chambers, i.e., a reaction chamber and a temperature monitor chamber. In Figure 2, a close-up of the final chip is shown. For clarity reasons, the two microfluidic structures are colored with food coloring dye. The reaction chamber is based on the work of Bruijns et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] and its dimensions are chosen in such way that the internal volume of the reaction chamber is the same as the reaction volume of the used Illustra GenomiPhi V2 DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) together with the EvaGreen dye solution (Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA), while maintaining an as low as possible surface-area-to-volume ratio [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]. Using SolidWorks 2018 computer-aided design (CAD) software (Dassault Systemes, V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France), the 3D image of the chip is drawn and with the use of the AutoDesk HSMWorks computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) plug-in (Autodesk Inc., San Rafael, CA, USA), this image is transferred into a computer numerical control (CNC) milling code. The total chip size is 3 cm by 3 cm and contains an inlet and outlet of 1.5 mm diameter. The inlet and outlet are of such size that the reaction chamber can be filled using pipette tips. In between the inlet and outlet, a rectangular reaction chamber of 10 mm by 3 mm is located. Two trapezoid structures are placed in the tapered channels between the inlet/outlet and the chamber. The function of these trapezoids is twofold: First, they minimize the dead volume between the inlet/outlet and the reaction chamber, locating as much as possible of the reaction mixture inside the chamber. Second, they provide support for the chamber closure. A stadium-shaped channel of 1.5 mm wide and 1.0 mm deep is located next to the reaction chamber, in such way that this channel is also covered by the heater. This channel serves as temperature monitor chamber. A thermocouple is inserted in this channel for real-time monitoring of the temperature inside the chip. This way, a more accurate temperature of the reaction mixture inside the chip can be obtained. Via a feedback loop, the input potential can be changed when required. In Figure 3, the SolidWorks design of the chamber-based chip with both chambers is shown. In Figure A1, in Appendix A, the technical drawing of the chip can be found.",

Values for \u03bai can be found in Appendix B. From Equation (3), the product Rth \u00d7 A can be defined as the sum of 1/h and li/\u03bai. Based on this summation, one can conclude that the convective heat transfer to the air is the most present heat transfer mechanism within the system (begin almost a factor 100 higher than the heat lost in the COC and H2O). This is also evident from solving Equation (2) for every individual temperature differences within the system and also including convective heat transfer directly from the heater into the air.

The only side note here is that at higher temperatures, the temperature gradient through the system also becomes larger. This can be eliminated by using double-sided heating, like Chung et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>].",

The meandering heater are assumed to be lines at the bottom side of the layer stack. This reduces the required complexity of the mesh tremendously, as the heater in the real device will be approximately 100 nm in thickness.

            "COC [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>] is chosen as polymeric substrate because of its biocompatibility, optical transparency, physical resistance, chemical resistance, electrical insulation, and price. This copolymer consists of two monomers, an apolar bridged cyclic hydrocarbon (norbornene) monomer and a linear, lesser apolar, linear ethene monomers. Injection molded COC plates (10 cm by 10 cm and 1.5 mm thickness) of the grade TOPAS 6017 (see Figure 4a) are obtained via Kunststoff-Zentrum Leipzig (Kunststoff-Zentrum gGmbH, Leipzig, Germany). This grade is chosen because of its high norbornene content, giving it a relatively high Tg of 170 \u25e6C. This minimizes the chance of melting during the milling process and decreases the chance of heater failure due to a deforming substrate during operation of the heater [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. The microfluidic structure explained in Section 2.1 is CNC-milled using a Mikron WF 21C milling machine (Mikron SA Agno, Agno, Switzerland), as can be seen in Figure 4b. Milling is a very fast prototyping technique and chosen because of its flexibility [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. The milling creates a surface roughness, which increases the surface-area-to-volume ratio. This roughness increases the chance of inhibition during the amplification due to the interaction of the used chemicals with the surface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]. It also causes a considerable loss of optical transparency, which could obstruct the potential use of in situ fluorescence detection in future devices. Therefore, a chemical post-treatment with cyclohexane vapor is done (see Figure 4c). Such treatment dissolves a thin outer layer of the COC substrate and causes reflowing of the surface roughness due to the surface tension of the material, restoring the optical transparency and reducing the surface roughness [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>].",

However, COC has the possibility of being injection molded [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. The used substrates are made using this method. This is a large-scale production method and could lower the costs of the eventual product and it eliminates the cyclohexane vapor post-treatment, as injection-molded chips would have the same optical transparency as the pristine substrates. Guckenberger et al mention production costs of $ 47 per simple microfluidic device when only 50 pieces are fabricated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>].

The heater width for both geometries is 0.3 mm, while the heater spacing in Figure 5b,c are 0.3 mm and 2.0 mm, respectively. In Figure 6a\u2013d, tables with the results of the full parametric sweep for different heater widths and heater spacings are shown. Figure 6a shows the temperature deviation between the highest and lowest temperature at the top of the chamber, i.e., the second H2O and COC interface (\u2206Ttop of chamber = Ttop,max \u2212 Ttop,min). Figure 6b shows the deviation between the highest and lowest temperature inside the chamber, i.e., between the two COC and H2O interfaces (\u2206Tacross chamber = Tbottom,max \u2212 Ttop,min). Figure 6c shows the temperature deviation between the highest and lowest temperature at the bottom of the chamber, i.e., the first COC and H2O interface (\u2206Tbottom of chamber = Tbot,max \u2212 Tbot,min).

As can be seen from the results in Figure 6, a combination of small heater widths and heater spacings will result in smaller temperature differences inside the reaction mixture. This is evident as smaller heater spacings will result in a better coverage of the heated area by heater material. The smaller heater widths will result in a smaller heater cross-sectional area, and thus can be operated at lower powers, as is evident from Equation (1). Resulting in the fact that a densely packed meander structure with small heater widths and small heater spacings can dissipate more heat into the system.",

A side note on the chosen heater width and heater spacing is that according to the simulations, the temperature differences within the chamber are less than \u00b10.3 \u25e6C for the most unfavorable dimensions. This temperature difference is still well-accepted in the temperature window in which the MDA reaction takes place (25 \u25e6C to 35 \u25e6C).

Inhibition of the amplification can be caused by large surface areas as the used chemicals have more surface to have interaction with [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]. The created surface roughness is visualized using a FEI Sirion high resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM) (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and measured using a Bruker Icon Dimension AFM in tapping mode with Bruker Tespa-V2 cantilevers (Bruker Nano Surfaces, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) and Gwyddion 2.52 open source freeware [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>]. The results are shown in Figure 8. The surface roughness of pristine COC had a RRMS of 3.5 nm. This increased two orders of magnitude after milling (RRMS of 310.1 nm). With the reported surface treatment [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>] we were capable of decreasing the surface roughness to a value even lower than that of pristine COC and the lowest reported in literature (RRMS of 0.9 nm). For this grade of COC (TOPAS 6017) it worked the best to do four short exposures of 5 s, with N2 blow drying after each exposure, instead of one longer exposure, as is more common in other grades of COC [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. The difference in duration for the cyclohexane vapor post-treatment can be explained by the different ratios of the copolymers present in each grade. As the grade number increase, the ratio changes towards more norbornene monomers and less linear ethene monomers. The norbornene is more apolar due to the bridged cyclic hydrocarbon present in its molecular structure and therefore, will dissolve faster in non-polar solvents, like cyclohexane (vapor).",

            "After the amplifications, the reaction mixtures are pipetted out of the chips and tubes and into 1 mL quartz cuvettes containing 55 \u03bcL MilliQ DI water (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Fluorescence measurements are done in a Horiba Scientific FluoroMax+ spectrofluorometer to verify each amplification. The mixture is excitated at a wavelength of 500 nm and the emission spectrum is measured at wavelengths from 510 nm to 550 nm (bounded EvaGreen dye has a peak at 525 nm [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>]). The measured spectra are normalized by subtracting the background signal of a mixture containing only the reaction buffer, the sample buffer, EvaGreen, and DNA. No Enzyme was added to this mixture, therefore no amplification could take place. See Figure 15 for the results obtained in the Eppendorf tube and chips. Figure A4 in Appendix E shows the background signal which is subtracted from all measurements.",

            "As can be seen in Figure 15, the spectra of the amplification performed inside the chip, and by applying heat with the water bath as well as with the integrated Au-resistive heater, show the same trend as the amplification performed in the Eppendorf and heated by water bath. There is an order of magnitude difference in the fluorescence signal. However, the fluorescence intensity cannot be used as a value to quantify the amount of DNA. EvaGreen is a bis-intercalating cyanine fluorescence dye consisting of two monomeric DNA-binding dyes which are linked by a flexible spacer. These two DNA-binding dyes bind each in between two base pairs, which make them simple and fast, but also nonuniform and non-specific [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>]. However, with this dye, a simple yes-or-no answer can be obtained if the amplification took place, as can be seen in Figure 15."

        "4. Conclusions": [
            "The aim of this study was to fabricate biocompatible, low-cost, and disposable chips with integrated heater, which should be able to perform DNA amplification, and possible in situ fluorescence detection in the near future. In this case there is no interest in quantification of the DNA, but only in amplification of DNA until the detection threshold is reached. As proof-of-principle the MDA reaction and ex-situ fluorescence measurements were used.",
            "With the proposed fabrication process, low-cost and biocompatible chips (Figure 12b) were fabricated. The integrated resistive heaters on the chips were characterized and showed a temperature stability of \u00b12 \u25e6C over a time period of 25 h, which is at least twelve-fold longer than the required operating times for DNA amplification reactions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. The main cause of this period of lowered temperature was due to the fact that the measurement was run overnight.",
            "With the proof-of-principle device, successful DNA amplifications using MDA inside a disposable polymeric chip were achieved. The heat for the reaction was applied using the integrated low-cost Au-resistive heater. The device was operated at a suitable temperature for MDA reactions and the amplified DNA was measured using EvaGreen fluorescence dye and an ex situ spectrofluorometer. A distinct peak is visible in the reaction mixtures which is absent in the NTC mixtures. The operating temperature for MDA reactions is around 30 \u25e6C, which is comparable with a nice summer day. Using amplification reactions which such low reaction temperatures could encounter problems at warmer locations. However, as MDA is not sequence specific, this reaction will not be integrated in the final protocols. MDA was only used as proof-of-principle reaction to show the biocompatibility of the device and functioning of the integrated heater. Sequence specific amplifications, e.g., HDA and LAMP, are performed at higher temperatures, as will be discussed in Section 5. This makes the system less sensitive to the hot summer days.",
            "The device in its current state is not fully conform the WHO-SDI ASSURED criteria [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>] as it still relies on the use of (expensive) external equipment. However, the first steps are made to an ASSURED device. Future steps which will make the device fully ASSURED are given in the next section (Section 5)."
        ],
        "5. Outlook": [
            "Future steps, which will result in a device for early-stage detection of, for example, zoonoses, include studies on the optimization of this device for sequence specific DNA amplifications (e.g., primer design and reaction optimization), i.e., HDA or LAMP. HDA utilizes DNA helicase (an enzyme also used in vitro during DNA replication) to separate the dsDNA instead of thermal denaturation. After separation, ssDNA binding proteins hybridize on the ssDNA strands for stabilization, ensuring that the next primer will have time to bind to the ssDNA stripe and a DNA polymerase will extend the primers with the complementary bases. This method is a truly isothermal technique in which the separation of the dsDNA can be performed at the same temperature as the amplification reaction, i.e., 64 \u25e6C [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. LAMP is more similar to MDA in the way it also uses heat to denature the dsDNA. After denaturation, a set of four primers (six can be used as well to achieve better selectivity) and a DNA polymerase is used at isothermal conditions (65 \u25e6C) to amplify the DNA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. When used in combination with reverse transcriptase, LAMP becomes a RNA amplification method, which could be used for RNA-containing viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], like virus-based zoonoses diseases as the corona viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Despite not being a truly isothermal technique, LAMP offers the possibility to use turbidity as detection method [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c76\" href=\"#r76\">76</a>]. Such a detection method would simplify the required equipment even further as a decrease in transmitted light through the chip can be used as detection method.",
            "Different amplification techniques require different temperatures. Based on Table 1 one can conclude that a higher temperature would also give a larger temperature gradient within the system. This can be disadvantageous for amplification reactions, as optimal denaturation temperatures are in the range 92 \u25e6C to 94 \u25e6C [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>]. The denaturation in this research was done in a separate water bath, so this temperature gradient was circumvented. However, when on-chip denaturation and/or another amplification technique will be used, a second step will be the optimization of the heater in order to create better temperature uniformity within the system. This can be done by using different heater geometries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] or using double-sided heating [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>].",
            "The third step that has to be optimized in the sample collection and work-up procedure. One has to think of what kind of samples to collect in order to have the biggest chance of having the agent of the disease present in that sample (i.e., blood, mucus, saliva, etc.). Such crude samples contain full cells, with the DNA present within. There are different approaches to perform cell lysis in order to extract the DNA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>]. Various components of bodily fluids, and reagents and products of the lysis are well-known to inhibit the amplification reaction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c79\" href=\"#r79\">79</a>]. However, MDA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>] and HDA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] could also be performed on crude samples.",
            "A fourth step in the near-future is the development of a first prototype with all hardware integrated in a single piece of equipment. Such a device in its pure essence will consist of a battery to power the heater and detection, a chip holder to firmly keep the chip in its place, a thermocouple for real-time monitoring of the temperature, and a LED light and a photodiode. The lamp and photodiode could both be used for fluorescence measurements and turbidity measurements.",
