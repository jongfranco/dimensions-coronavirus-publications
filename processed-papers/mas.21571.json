        "abstract": "Biological mass spectrometry has evolved as a core analytical technology in the last decade mainly because of its unparalleled ability to perform qualitative as well as quantitative profiling of enormously complex biological samples with high mass accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity and specificity. Mass spectrometry-based techniques are also routinely used to assess glycosylation and other post-translational modifications, disulfide bond linkage, and scrambling as well as for the detection of host cell protein contaminants in the field of biopharmaceuticals. The role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development has been very limited but is now expanding as the landscape of global vaccine development is shifting towards the development of recombinant vaccines. In this review, the role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development is presented, some of the ongoing efforts to develop vaccines for diseases with global unmet medical need are discussed and the regulatory challenges of implementing mass spectrometry techniques in a quality control laboratory setting are highlighted.",

            "As the target populations for the vaccines are healthy individuals, pregnant women, or infants, vaccine safety is of paramount importance. Appropriately, the vaccine landscape is changing from traditional vaccine approaches to cost-effective, highly scalable, and safe recombinant vaccines.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Using recombinant DNA technology, antigens are expressed in yeast, Escherichia coli, baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), or mammalian cell lines.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] Recombinant antigens are engineered to mimic the first step of virus attachment to the cell surface which is mediated by specific glycoproteins. The expressed recombinant antigens undergo multiple purification cycles to produce highly purified vaccines.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]",
            "In order for recombinant vaccines to be acceptable to regulatory authorities, in-depth analytical characterization needs to be performed on the clinical trial material (CTM) to ensure the vaccine is safe and effective. Quality controlled (QC) analytical testing is routinely performed on the clinical trial material during batch release to certify that the content (testing performed by either reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), UV/Vis spectrophotometer [measuring absorbance at 280 nm] or SoloVPE [newest evolution of UV-Vis spectroscopy]), purity (testing performed by either size exclusion chromatography [SEC], sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [SDS-PAGE], or capillary electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate [CE-SDS] and capillary isoelectric focusing [cIEF]) and residual impurities (testing performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] for host cell proteins, quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR] for host cell DNA etc.) are within the product specifications and to ensure potency (testing performed by ELISA or ligand free binding assays such as biolayer interferometry [BLI], surface plasmon resonance [SPR]) and safety (microbial enumeration tests, endotoxin testing etc.) of the vaccine candidate (as per ICH harmonised tripartite guideline Q6B, http://www.ich.org). Another regulatory prerequisite is to perform extensive physiochemical characterization of these recombinant antigens. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice to perform the comprehensive physiochemical characterization of glycoproteins. Mass spectrometry-based characterization is critical not only from the standpoint of understanding the product's structure but also to help establish clinical trial material release specifications and to ensure quality (Figure 1).",
            "Thus, innovative vaccine structural design followed by comprehensive analytical characterization is required to successfully develop novel vaccines against epidemic infectious diseases impacting large segments of the global population.",
            "In this review, we focus on the expanding role of mass spectrometry in vaccine development, irrespective of the route of production. We also highlight the regulatory challenges and limitations of mass spectrometry-based techniques which constrain its further implementation as a quality control batch release assay in cGMP manufacturing.",
            "The role of mass spectrometry (MS) has been very limited in the discovery and development of traditional vaccines containing live, attenuated, or inactivated pathogens. However, as recombinant antigens or virus-like particles (VLPs) are being explored for vaccine development, new opportunities for the use of MS have emerged. Irrespective of the cells used for preparation of the vaccine, the expressed recombinant antigens mimic viral glycoprotein(s) and thus are inherently large molecule weight, structurally complex, and heterogeneous glycosylated proteins. The ease of coupling liquid chromatography (LC) with MS offers exciting opportunities to leverage this analytical platform to obtain detailed structural information about not only its primary structure (the amino acid sequence) but also the molecular weight, disulfide bond linkages, chemical modifications, and post-translational modifications (PTMs). One of the most abundant and complex protein PTMs is glycosylation which consists of an oligosaccharide linked to an amino acid in the protein. In the case of N-",
            "linked glycans, an asparagine residues at the sequence motif of asparagine-X-serine/threonine (where X is any amino acid except proline) is coupled via a nitrogen atom to the oligosaccharide. Alternatively, an O-linked glycan can be formed by linking the oligosaccharide to a serine or threonine residue. Glycosylation play a fundamental role in antigen conformation, folding, stability, solubility, and importantly, immune response.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] Plants, yeasts, and non-human cell lines generate glycans that are not compatible and bioactive within human hosts.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Thus, about 70% of all recombinant glycoproteins are produced in mammalian-based expression systems such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]",
            "Analytical characterization of a glycoprotein is challenging as there is inherent unpredictability associated with the glycans; they are either macroheterogeneous (potential glycan site in the protein not glycosylated) or microheterogeneous (different glycan structures found on the same site in the expressed protein). Glycosylation analysis is performed to understand the nature of structural heterogeneity of glycans, quantify them, and more importantly to determine where glycosylation occurs (site specific analysis). Mass spectrometry based techniques are valuable tool for detecting and investigating glycosylation (Figure 2). Although MS-based glycosylation analysis is not without limitations, the advances in MS instrumentation and glycan analysis software have led to increased resolution, automated identification, quantitative determination, and accurate structural characterization.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]",
            "Another critical quality attribute (CQA) of glycoprotein is intramolecular disulfide bonds (S-S linkages); they ensure correct folding, functional activity and stability. Incorrect formation of disulfide bonds can cause protein misfolding which tends to promote aggregation which could result in an unwarranted immune response.

            "MS is a technique of choice for the identification and structural characterization of tremendously complex glycoproteins and is a routinely used tool during the early research and development of protein-based molecules. Implementation of MS methods in chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) and quality control environments for vaccines has been of longstanding interest but has faced regulatory challenges. To the best of our knowledge, the authors are not aware of any LC-MS-based release method used for any vaccine product in the quality control/cGMP environment.",
            "There is always some reluctance to implement new methods in the quality control/cGMP environment and, in the case of MS, there are multiple misconceptions regarding the technique. Although MS is not without limitations, some of the misconceptions relating to reproducibility and validation are overstated. To implement a method in the QC environment, the method has to be validated to demonstrate the method's accuracy, precision, intermediate precision, specificity, linearity, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation. Furthermore, appropriate system suitability controls or calibrators are part of the method to ensure repeatability. All of these parameters and controls ensure that during the performance of the assay, no variability between different instruments and operators arises. Unfortunately, some aspect of these validation activities are inherently challenging for a MS-based method. Thus, the burden of proof lies with the vaccine developer to convince a regulator that the MS-based method is a phase appropriate release test without regulatory guidelines applicable to this class of drugs. It is clear from the author's perspective that classical validation regulations as stated in the ICH guidelines are unsuitable for MS-based methods. In the last decade, some of the conventional gelbased or plate-based release assays have been replaced by HPLC or capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods in the QC environment. These HPLC- or CE-based assays are used to monitor aggregation, fragmentation, clipping, and for content determination. As the application of MS in the vaccine QC environment is an evolving story, the challenge of convincing regulators should be directed toward highlighting MS capabilities as has been shown in the multiple examples in this manuscript. For those working in this field, it will be important to present MS data testing multiple quality attributes of the sample in the same analytical run in combination with HPLC/CE methods or by performing MS analysis to validate simpler HP/UPLC assays used to assess batch to batch consistency. In this way, comparative data sets could demonstrate what the authors believe is the ultimate utility of MS-based methods for QC release of vaccines. The main rational for the MS-based methods in the QC/cGMP environment should not be to replace the existing methods. Rather, it should be a supplemental batch release test to ensure that the product is within specifications and without any unwarranted modifications. Using MS techniques will ensure improved quality and increased safety for clinical trial participants."

        "4 | CONCLUSION": [
            "In conclusion, the evidence suggests that the emergence of MS-based techniques has advanced the field of vaccine development. LC coupled with MS represents a powerful characterization tool in vaccine development; especially for the recombinantly produced antigens. LCMS techniques are rapidly being used not only to quantitate vaccine antigens and explore molecular structure but also for the comprehensive analysis of glycans. An important question remains on how to establish the MS techniques in the quality control cGMP labs for vaccine release given the wide use of classical methods and lack of regulatory guidance. Nevertheless, after a decade of steady partnership with vaccine developers, MS has expanded from a niche application to an enabling platform for vaccine development."
