        "abstract": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are by far the largest group of known positive\u2010sense RNA viruses having an extensive range of natural hosts. In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs. In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV\u2010induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis and clinical treatment.",

                "caption": "The innate immune response and adaptive immune responses of Coronaviruses (CoV) infection during an infection. A, CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (ie, Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV. B, Attachment of CoV to DPP4R on the host cell through S protein leads to the appearance of genomic RNA in the cytoplasm. An immune response to dsRNA can be partially generated during CoV replication. TLR\u20103 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NF\u2010\u03baB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere with TLR\u20103 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR\u20103 activation and evade the immune response. TLR\u20104 might recognize S protein and lead to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines through the MyD88\u2010dependent signaling pathway. Virus\u2010cell interactions lead to the strong production of immune mediators. The secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines (IL\u20101, IL\u20106, IL\u20108, IL\u201021, TNF\u2010\u03b2, and MCP\u20101) is promoted in infected cells in response to CoV infection. These chemokines and cytokines, in turn, recruit lymphocytes and leukocytes to the site of infection. Red lines refer to inhibitory effects. Green lines refer to activating effects receptor\u2010related kinases IRAK4, IRAKI, IRAK2, and IRAK\u2010M. IRAK4 plays an important role in activating NF\u2010kB and MAPKs downstream of MyD88. IRAK interacts with TRAF6, which causes its K\u201063 ubiquitination, and facilitates NEMO ubiquitination to activate NF\u2010kB. TRIF\u2010 dependent pathways activate IRF3 and NF\u2010kB.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] In addition to activating NF\u2010kB, TRIF\u2010dependent pathways, they also activate IRF3 and interferon\u2010\u03b2.10,11"

However, it should be noted that immunopathogenesis is associated with an immune response out of control, which may result in pulmonary tissue damage, functional impairment, and reduced lung capacity. Chemotactic factors are essential to the immune responses against the virus infections, given their regulatory effect on dilations and positions of leukocytes in the host lungs. Therefore, spectral changes in chemotactic factors may lead to severely maladjusted immune responses. Immune insufficiency or misdirection may increase viral replication and cause tissue damages.

C3a and C5a blockade acts as a treatment for acute lung injury, and anti\u2010 C5a antibody shows to protect mice from infection with MERS\u2010CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>] SARA\u2010CoV infection activates the complement pathway and complement signaling contributes to disease.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>] is important to determine whether the antibodies are powerful in the adaptive immune responses to MERS\u2010CoV infection. Research from all over the world have described more than 20 kinds of monoclonal antibodies, most of which are human or humanized antibodies. The virus uses its spike proteins as an adhesion factor to facilitate host entry through a special receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 (DPP4). This receptor is considered a key factor in the signal transmission and activation of acquired and innate immune responses in infected patients. Thus, compared with the time\u2010consuming vaccine preparation, the design of monoclonal antibodies against these proteins has a better protective effect.",
            "Human monoclonal antibody (m336) isolated from the phage display library interacts with the receptor\u2010binding region of MES coronavirus spike protein and displays strong neutralization activity to MES\u2010CoV in vitro.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>] Human monoclonal antibody m336 shows high neutralization activity to MERS\u2010CoV in vitro. m336 reduces the RNA titer of lung by 40 000 to 90 000 folds.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>] After infection with MERS\u2010CoV, monkeys were treated with high\u2010titer hyperimmune plasma or monoclonal antibody m336. Both groups had relieved symptoms of clinical diseases, but the reduction of respiratory viral load was only found in the hyperimmune plasma group. Although both super immune plasma and m336 therapy show to mitigate the disease of the common marmoset, neither has the ability to prevent the disease completely.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>] Yet, HMab m336 is found to significantly reduce the viral RNA titers and viral\u2010associated pathological changes in rabbit lung tissue.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>] Mice inoculated with S nanoparticles produced high\u2010level neutralizing antibodies against homologous viruses, and these antibodies have no cross\u2010protection with heteroviruses.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c96\" href=\"#r96\">96</a>] After being stimulated by SARS\u2010CoV, immunized ferrets produced more rapid and stronger neutralizing antibody reaction than the control animals; however, the strong inflammatory reaction is observed in liver tissue. All this suggests that the expression of SARS\u2010 CoV S protein is associated with enhanced hepatitis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>] On the other hand, the time course of SARS\u2010CoV viremia and antibody response has been studied.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c98\" href=\"#r98\">98</a>] SARS\u2010CoV viremia is not detected in the blood samples of convalescent patients. In the peak period of viremia, 75% of the blood samples of patients diagnosed as SARS in the first 1 to 2 weeks before detection can detect virus RNA. The prolongation of IgG production may indicate the significance of IgG in both humoral immune response to acute SARS\u2010CoV infection and clearance of the remaining virus sources during recovery. This is an important subject that needs further study."

        "4 | CONCLUSIONS": [
            "The antibody response in vivo is a dynamic and complex mixture of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which work together to target different antigenic domains on the envelope glycoprotein of the virus. It",
            "Since the emergence of SARS\u2010CoV in 2002 and its spread throughout 32 countries and areas, the world has experienced the outbreak of MERS\u2010CoV and now, the 2019\u2010nCoV. All these viruses belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae. Since CoVs emerge periodically and unpredictably, spread rapidly, and induce serious infectious diseases, they become a continuous threat to human health. This is especially true when there are no approved vaccines or drugs for the treatment of CoV infections and there exists a range of animal reservoirs for CoVs and recombinant CoVs. In recent years, profound understandings of the innate immune response to viruses have been made. This type of immune response inhibits virus replication, promotes virus clearance, induces tissue repair, and triggers a prolonged adaptive immune response against the viruses. In most cases, pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses associated with CoVs are triggered by the innate immune system when it recognizes the viruses. Although a broadly protective, universal vaccine is considered the ultimate protection against the virus spread, vaccine development can be time\u2010consuming. To fulfill the pressing need, we should propose effective therapeutic measures using the accumulated knowledge of the innate immune response system. Targeted immunotherapy is a good alternative to some antivirals that have narrow treatment windows and meet with drug resistance easily. In 2003, glucocorticoid was widely used in SARS treatment to control pulmonary infection by regulating inflammatory responses. Except for viral pathogenicity, the inflammatory response of the body also plays a crucial role in SARS\u2010induced lung injury cases. Therefore, in CoV pneumonia cases, it is important to control cytokine production and inflammatory response, given that they are responsible for the accumulation of cells and fluids. This strategy is challenging as we have not yet clearly identified any features in an immune response that can be inhibited specifically without compromising the beneficial host defense.",
            "However, accomplishing this is not impossible. Notable achievements have been made in analyzing detrimental and protective mechanisms. For instance, completely blocking a proximal event in the immune response (eg, activation of IFN response\u2010related PRRs) seems unwise considering its general role in regulating the host defense. In contrast, more limited and specific effector arms, such as controlled production of oxygen radicals, NET formation, IL\u20101, IL\u20104, IL \u20106, IL\u20108, and IL\u201021 production, are probably practicable targets. At last, further research is needed to improve the understanding of the temporal features of CoV\u2010induced inflammatory response in relation to the timing of therapeutic interventions."
