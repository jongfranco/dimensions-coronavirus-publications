The epidemic soon spread throughout the country and became a pandemic in over a month. Government and medical institutions across the country mobilized all kinds of resources and took a variety of measures to actively treat patients and stop the epidemic. Based on current studies, the author summarized the clinical characteristics and evolution of the novel viral pneumonia, and proposed the key points of diagnosis and treatment, the scientific management of both confirmed and suspected cases, and the scientific management of disease prevention and control."
