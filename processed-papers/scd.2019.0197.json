        "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are malignancies that originate in the mucosal lining of the upper aerodigestive tract. Despite advances in therapeutic interventions, survival rates among HNSCC patients have remained static for years. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are tumor-initiating cells that are highly resistant to treatment, and are hypothesized to contribute to a significant fraction of tumor recurrences. Consequently, further investigations of how CSCs mediate recurrence may provide insights into novel druggable targets. A key element of recurrence involves the tumor\u2019s ability to evade immunosurveillance. Recent published reports suggest that CSCs possess immunosuppressive properties, however, the underlying mechanism have yet to be fully elucidated. To date, most groups have focused on the role of CSC-derived secretory proteins, such as cytokines and growth factors. Here, we review the established immunoregulatory role of exosomes derived from mixed tumor cell populations, and propose further study of CSC-derived exosomes may be warranted. Such studies may yield novel insights into new druggable targets, or lay the foundation for future exosome-based diagnostics.",

            "CSCs are highly tumorigenic and resistant to traditional cancer treatments, giving rise to local and distal tumor recurrence. To date, published reports have focused on CSCs\u2019 secretions of cytokines rather than exosomes. However, a growing body of evidence has established that exosomes derived from complex tumor tissue specimens comprised of multiple subpopulations of cells possess potent immunoregulatory properties that facilitate tumor progression. It is critical to distinguish whether these exosomes were derived from CSCs or solely from non-CSC to identify potential mechanistic differences for novel therapeutic interventions and diagnostics specifically targeting CSCs. However, it is feasible that many of the properties attributed to TEX are also associated with CSCEX. Further investigation of CSCEX, and their effects on the immune system, may uncover previously undiscovered mechanisms underlying the suppression of antitumor immunity, thereby elucidating novel druggable immunotherapy targets. Targeting of CSCs is an attractive approach to limit cancer treatment resistance, and to prevent tumor relapse."

        "Conclusion": [
            "CSCs are highly tumorigenic and resistant to traditional cancer treatments, giving rise to local and distal tumor recurrence. To date, published reports have focused on CSCs\u2019 secretions of cytokines rather than exosomes. However, a growing body of evidence has established that exosomes derived from complex tumor tissue specimens comprised of multiple subpopulations of cells possess potent immunoregulatory properties that facilitate tumor progression. It is critical to distinguish whether these exosomes were derived from CSCs or solely from non-CSC to identify potential mechanistic differences for novel therapeutic interventions and diagnostics specifically targeting CSCs. However, it is feasible that many of the properties attributed to TEX are also associated with CSCEX. Further investigation of CSCEX, and their effects on the immune system, may uncover previously undiscovered mechanisms underlying the suppression of antitumor immunity, thereby elucidating novel druggable immunotherapy targets. Targeting of CSCs is an attractive approach to limit cancer treatment resistance, and to prevent tumor relapse.",
