The two models used to estimate the reproduction number (coalescent\u2010based exponential growth and a birth\u2010death skyline method) indicated an estimated mean evolutionary rate of 7.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 subs/site/year (range, 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22124\u201015 \u00d7 10\u22124) and a mean tMRCA of the tree root of 73 days. The estimated R value was 2.6 (range, 2.1\u20105.1), and increased from 0.8 to 2.4 in December 2019. The estimated mean doubling time of the epidemic was between 3.6 and 4.1 days. This study proves the usefulness of phylogeny in supporting the surveillance of emerging new infections even as the epidemic is growing.",

        "discussion": [
            "The SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic is unique in the history of human infectious diseases not only because it is caused by a novel virus, but also because of the immediate availability of epidemiological and genomic data (the first entire genome was published on 24 December 2019). The prompt availability of research data on internet platforms such as the GISAID has allowed us and other research groups to make a phylogenetic reconstruction of the origin of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and to share these findings with other scientists.<br/><br/>The temporal reconstruction of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 phylogeny obtained in the present study is in line with previous estimates and suggests that the epidemic originated between October and November 2019, several weeks before the first cases were described. This was confirmed by means of coalescent analysis and the birth\u2010death method of estimating the origin of the epidemic. The estimated evolutionary rate is also in line with that of SARS and MERS viruses,[12,13] and the recent estimates concerning SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic\u2010analysis\u2010 67\u2010genomes\u201008\u2010feb\u20102020/356).<br/><br/>One of the most important epidemiological parameters when monitoring an epidemic is R0 (ie, the number of secondary cases induced by a single infected individual in a totally susceptible population) because it is fundamental to assess the potential spread of a microorganism. Its value changes during an epidemic being called the effective reproduction number (Re). R0 is usually estimated on the basis of the growth rate of the number of cases. The available epidemiological estimates of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 R0 range from 2.2 to 2.9, although they changed from 1.4 to more than 7 during the first phases of the epidemic.[10,14]"

Given the large credibility interval (CI) and high level of uncertainty due to very close sampling dates, all the estimates were made using days as the unit of time and a normal prior with substitution rates obtained from our preliminary estimates (mean rate 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 subs/site/day, with a standard deviation of 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126).",
            "The MCMC analysis was run until convergence with sampling every 100 000 generations. Convergence was assessed by estimating the effective sampling size (ESS) after 10% burn\u2010in using Tracer v.1.7 software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/), and accepting ESS values of 300 or more. The uncertainty of the estimates is indicated by 95% highest marginal likelihoods estimated[6] by path sampling (PS)/stepping stone (SS) methods.[7]",

        "4 | DISCUSSION": [
            "The SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic is unique in the history of human infectious diseases not only because it is caused by a novel virus, but also because of the immediate availability of epidemiological and genomic data (the first entire genome was published on 24 December 2019). The prompt availability of research data on internet platforms such as the GISAID has allowed us and other research groups to make a phylogenetic reconstruction of the origin of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and to share these findings with other scientists.",
            "The temporal reconstruction of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 phylogeny obtained in the present study is in line with previous estimates and suggests that the epidemic originated between October and November 2019, several weeks before the first cases were described. This was confirmed by means of coalescent analysis and the birth\u2010death method of estimating the origin of the epidemic. The estimated evolutionary rate is also in line with that of SARS and MERS viruses,[12,13] and the recent estimates concerning SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic\u2010analysis\u2010 67\u2010genomes\u201008\u2010feb\u20102020/356).",
            "One of the most important epidemiological parameters when monitoring an epidemic is R0 (ie, the number of secondary cases induced by a single infected individual in a totally susceptible population) because it is fundamental to assess the potential spread of a microorganism. Its value changes during an epidemic being called the effective reproduction number (Re). R0 is usually estimated on the basis of the growth rate of the number of cases. The available epidemiological estimates of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 R0 range from 2.2 to 2.9, although they changed from 1.4 to more than 7 during the first phases of the epidemic.[10,14]",
            "Recently developed evolutionary models have made it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters on the basis of phylogenesis,[9,15] and a coalescent and birth\u2010death methods were used to estimate R0 and the changes in the Re of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic during a short period of time. This has allowed us to make a preliminary estimate that mean R0 from the beginning of the epidemic to the first days of February 2020 was 2.2 (range, 3.6\u20105.8), and the birth\u2010death skyline analysis showed an increase in Re from less than 1 to 2.4 (CI, 1.5\u20103.5) during December 2019. This agrees with the BSP analysis showing an increase in the number of infections in the same period of time. Commonly, the Re decreases during an epidemic because the decrease in the number of susceptible individuals. However, an increase in Re could be due to an increase in the transmissibility of the virus or in the contact rates within the population.[16] It is, therefore, possible to hypothesize, on the basis of our data, that the first passage of the virus from animal to human occurred through rather inefficient and still unknown transmission modes causing relatively few cases in the early times (before December). In December, the virus acquired a more efficient mode of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission (ie, through droplets), causing exponential growth also detected by the skyline.",
            "On the same basis, the estimated epidemic doubling time was 3.6 days with a CI between 1 and 7 days. We also tried to calculate it on the basis of the transmission (\u03bb) and recovery rate (\u03b4) estimated using the birth\u2010death model, which lead to an estimated mean doubling time of 4.1 days, with the most probable values falling between 3.9 and 4.3 days. Previous studies have suggested that the doubling time during the early phases of the epidemic was approximately 7.4 days.[10] The difference in the estimate here obtained, may be due to the increased epidemic growth rate observed during the last days of January, or the initial delay in recognizing and reporting new cases.",
            "This preliminary study has some limitations. The R values and doubling times were estimated phylogenetically using all of the whole genomes available in a public database at the time the study was carried out (https://www.gisaid.org/). Given the small number of sequences and the relatively short sampling period, the CIs are wide and limit the precision of the estimates. Moreover, the analysis included isolates collected outside mainland China as it is assumed that they all belong to the same epidemic originating in Wuhan.",
            "Serial intervals were used to estimate the duration of infectiousness, although we do not yet have any information concerning the possible existence and duration of a latent (preinfectious) period that would contribute to the serial interval.",
            "More detailed and accurate analyses can be made when a larger number of genomes and more precise data on the infectious period become available. However, although the R0 calculated on the basis of the direct observation of the number of infected individuals may be affected by omissions or delayed notifications of cases,[17] a phylogenetic estimate of the same parameter may be more reliable.",
            "This became particularly evident recently (on 12 February 2020) when the change in diagnosis classification led to a sudden",
            "|5 increase in the reported cases by Hubei, China (https://myemail. constantcontact.com/COVID\u201019\u2010Updates\u2010\u2010\u2010Feb\u201012.html?soid=1107 826135286&aid=Kdg8a0rBTAk).",
            "In conclusion, these results allowed us to make a phylogenetic estimate of the R0 of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection that is similar to that obtained using conventional epidemiological methods[18] (https:// www.who.int/news\u2010room/detail/23\u201001\u20102020\u2010statement\u2010on\u2010the\u2010 meeting\u2010of\u2010the\u2010international\u2010health\u2010regulations\u2010(2005)\u2010emergency\u2010 committee\u2010regarding\u2010the\u2010outbreak\u2010of\u2010novel\u2010coronavirus\u2010(SARS\u2010 CoV\u20102), and a possibly shorter estimated doubling time of the number of subjects involved at least during the early phases of the epidemic. They also support the usefulness of phylodynamic as an important complement to classic approaches to the surveillance and monitoring of an emerging infection, even during the course of an epidemic."
