        "abstract": "Infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been associated with villous atrophy within 48 h, which seriously disrupts intestinal homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we found that TGEV infection severely disrupted intestinal homeostasis via inhibition of self-renewal and differentiation in Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Profoundly, TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex-mediated the inactivation of Notch signaling provided a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Initial invasions by TGEV-targeted Paneth cells through aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor, then inducing mitochondrial damage and ROS generation in them, ultimately causing Paneth cell decrease and loss of Notch factors (DII4 and Hes5), which are essential for Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs selfrenewal and differentiation. Interestingly, loss of Notch signaling induced goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive enterocytes and promoted mucins secretion, which accelerated TGEV replication. Therefore, the more differentiation of goblet cells, the greater TGEV infection in jejunum. These results provide a detailed mechanistic pathway by which villous atrophy sharply occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum within 48 h. Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a \u201cbottom up scenario\u201d, which is contrary to the traditional \u201ctop down\u201d hypothesis. Together, our findings provide a potential link between diarrheal virus infection and crypt cells response that regulates Paneth cells function and Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs fate and could be exploited for therapeutic application.",

            "In summary, our findings highlight a link between intestinal crypt cells response and virus infection that regulates Paneth cells function and Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs fate. TGEV infection causes loss of Notch signaling, which inhibits Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs self-renewal and differentiation and causes villous atrophy. This phenomenon can also be regarded as an explanation of TGEV pathogenicity, and possibly represents similar pathways used by other diarrheal virus (such as rotavirus) and bacteria, to disrupt intestinal homeostasis. Given its central role in TGEV infection, Notch signaling is an attractive therapeutic target for TGEV infection. Future studies will explore how intestinal crypt regenerates the damaged gut with diarrheal virus infection."

Thus, as time goes on, the more TGEV invades intestinal epithelial cells, the more severe damage occurs in vivo. A vicious circle is gradually forms in TGEV-infected jejunum. This flawlessly explains why sharp villus atrophy occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum.

Histological analysis of these samples revealed that TGEV significantly disrupted intestinal morphology in small intestine, especially in jejunum (Fig. 1a). The most striking features were villous atrophy. Villous height decreased sharply, accompanying with enterocyte shedding, followed by crypt hyperplasia (Fig. 1a, b). Subsequently, the representative tight junction proteins Zo-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 were determined by using western blot (WB). The results indicated that TGEV solely down-regulated Zo-1 protein level in infected jejunum (Fig. 1c, d). Moreover, we found that TGEV infection robustly halted cell proliferation both in crypt and villous (Fig. 1e, f), as assessed by Ki67 staining. Unlike cell proliferation, TGEV induced cell apoptosis solely in crypt cells, as detected by TUNEL staining (Fig. 1g, h). These results also were confirmed in IPEC-J2 cells (a jejunal epithelial cell line). TGEV infection not only inhibited cell proliferation, but also induced cell apoptosis in 36 h post infected cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Together, these data strongly suggest that TGEV infection inhibits epithelial selfrenewal and disrupts intestinal homeostasis."

            "It is now well established that intestinal crypt cells respond to damage induced by high-dose irradiation or chemicals by activation of reserve stem cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Here, we reveal intestinal crypt cells exhibit a novel response to a diarrheal virus (Fig. 8). In this study we found that TGEV infection results in villous atrophy within 48 h and inhibits intestinal epithelium renewal by halting the selfrenewal and differentiation of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs. As the epithelium of the intestine is the fastest renewing tissue, sustained by Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs28, once Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs lose the ability of self-renewal and diferentiation, it will seriously affect intestinal epithelium turnover and perturb intestinal homeostasis. A recent report similarly showed that Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection causes Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs loss through activating IFN-\u03b3 generation and induces fetal-like reversion in the intestinal stem-cell niche[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs are apoptosis sensitive cells to different types of stresses (such as ROS), so it is easy to be attacked[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Previous study demonstrated that TGEV-encoded N protein induced ROS generation, which contributes to cell apoptosis activation via p53 signaling in ST cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. Although TGEV induces mildly ROS production in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, it robustly promotes ROS generation in Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs (data not shown), which provides a potential explanation of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs loss and why more apoptosis cells were observed in crypt."

            "Therefore, we collected the duodenum, jejunum and ileum tissues for intestinal architecture analysis. Histological analysis of these samples revealed that TGEV significantly disrupted intestinal morphology in small intestine, especially in jejunum (Fig. 1a). The most striking features were villous atrophy. Villous height decreased sharply, accompanying with enterocyte shedding, followed by crypt hyperplasia (Fig. 1a, b). Subsequently, the representative tight junction proteins Zo-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 were determined by using western blot (WB).

TGEV infection not only inhibited cell proliferation, but also induced cell apoptosis in 36 h post infected cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Together, these data strongly suggest that TGEV infection inhibits epithelial selfrenewal and disrupts intestinal homeostasis.",
            "To test the hypothesis that TGEV infection disruption intestinal homeostasis through inhibiting the self-renewal and differentiation of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs, WB, FACS, FISH and IF staining were used to determine the self-renewal of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs in TGEV-infected jejunum. We observed a significant decrease in Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs number within crypt tissues for TGEV-infected jejunum (Fig. 2a, b). Similarly, Olfm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], another marker of ISCs, was repressed (Fig. 2a\u2013d). In parallel, similar results were found in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2a, b). We then examined the differentiation pattern of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs in TGEV-infected jejunum. The number of enterocytes was distinctly decreased in TGEV-infected jejunum, as revealed by SI protein expression (Fig. 2c, d). Similar results were determined in Paneth cells (Fig. 2e, f). Moreover, TGEV infection not only decreased the number of Paneth cells in crypts, but also caused enteroendocrine cells loss in crypts and villi (Fig. 2c, d, g, and h). In contrast, Muc[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] protein level and PAS staining showed that TGEV infection strongly increased the number of goblet cells both in crypts and villi (Fig. 2c, d, i, and j). Subsequently, we found that TGEV infection not",
            "only halts cell proliferation and but also induces cell apoptosis in Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs (Supplementary Fig. S2c, d). Together, TGEV infection induces goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive enterocytes in TGEVinfected jejunum and severely alters Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs fate.",
            "To uncover the potential mechanisms for Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs loss and the impact of TGEV infection on the niche signals for Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs fate decision, we took advantage of TGEVinfected IPEC-J2 cells model. FACS for CD24 demonstrated that TGEV infection resulted in CD24 cell loss in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3a), and IF staining results also revealed that TGEV infection decreased the expression of CD24 in TGEV-infected jejunum (Supplementary Fig. S3b, c). Subsequently, we found TGEV infection caused Paneth cell (CD24+SSChigh cells) and enteroendocrine cell (CD24+SSClow cells) loss (Supplementary Fig S3d; Fig. 3a, b), as was observed in TGEV-infected jejunum (Fig. 2e\u2013h). We next examined apoptotic cell death and cell proliferation to determine potential mechanisms for Paneth cells loss with TGEV infection. Either early cell apoptosis or late cell apoptosis was robustly induced by TGEV in CD24+SSChigh cells (Supplementary Fig. S4a, b). Meanwhile, similar results were detected in CD24+SSClow cells (Supplementary Fig. S4c, d), but no changes in cell apoptosis were found in CD24\u2212cells (Supplementary Fig. S4e, f). Cell apoptosis mainly occurred in CD24+ cells. Moreover, combining with FACS analysis of Paneth cells proliferation with Ki67 staining, TGEV infection inhibited the proliferation of Paneth cell (CD24+SSChigh cells) and enteroendocrine cell (CD24+SSClow cells) in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4g, h). Subsequently, we detected the mitochondrial function and ROS generation in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, which largely contribute to cell apoptosis and barrier functions of intestinal epithelial cells. As expected, TGEV infection significantly induced mitochondria damage and ROS production not only in Paneth cells (CD24+SSChigh cells) but also in enteroendocrine (CD24+SSClow cells) (Fig. 4a, b).",
            "Since Paneth cells provide various niche factors to support ISCs self-renewal and differentiation. Paneth cells loss seriously affects the number and function of ISCs through reducing niche factor generation. To reveal the effect of TGEV on niche factor production, we first detected the mRNA expression of the representative niche factor markers in TGEV-infected jejunum (Fig. 3c) and IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 3d). These results showed that TGEV infection significantly inhibited Notch ligand Dii[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] and Notch effector Hes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] mRNA expression. For Wnt (Wnt11) and BMP (Tgf-\u03b2) signaling, no significant changes in mRNA level were observed in TGEV-infected jejunum or IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 3c, d). Then DII4 and Hes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] protein expression was quantified in TGEV-infected jejunum and IPEC-J2 cells by using WB (Fig. 3e\u2013g). Infection by TGEV disrupted the Notch signaling for Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs self-renewal and differentiation via down-regulating DII4 and Hes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] protein expression both in in vivo (Fig. 3e, f) and in vitro (Fig. 3g). In addition, TGEV infection decreased SI, CgA, CD24 protein expression (Fig. 3g). Alternatively, goblet cells (Muc2) were up-regulated in TGEV-infected IPECJ2 cells (Fig. 3g), with similar effect on goblet cells was detected in TGEV-infected jejunum (Fig. 2c, i, j). Subsequently, we inhibited Notch signaling in IPEC-J2 cells by using N-S-phenyl-glycine-t-butyl ester (DAPT), a \u03b3secretase inhibitor, which turns proliferative cells in intestinal crypts and adenomas into goblet cells. As expected, DAPT rapidly induced goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive cells in IPEC-J2 cells (data not shown). Surprisingly, Notch signaling inhibition strongly promoted TGEV infection and replication in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 3h). Therefore, these results demonstrate that TGEV infection alters Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs fate via inducing Paneth cells loss and disrupting Notch signaling factors. Moreover, goblet cells differentiation enhances TGEV infection and replication.",
            "As noted earlier, TGEV infection distinctly affects the number and function of Paneth cells.

            "TGEV was mostly detected in CD24+ cells, which mainly include CD24+SSChigh cells (Paneth cells) and CD24+SSClow cells (enteroendocrine). In CD24+SSClow cells the effect was most pronounced, with the percentage of TGEV-positive cells nearly 10-fold as many as compared to other cell types in 24 h post TGEV-infected",
            "IPEC-J2 cells. However, a few cells were infected by TGEV in CD24\u2212 cells, which are mostly absorptive enterocytes (Fig. 5a). Although the difference of the infection proportion gradually narrowed in 36 h post infection, CD24+SSClow cells still contained more intracellular",

            "We followed those observations by examining TGEV infection rate over shorter time periods in several cell types. Surprisingly, in contrast to results from 24 and 36 h incubation, after only 1 h TGEV infection was higher in CD24+SSChigh cells than CD24+SSClow or CD24+SSC\u2212. About 20% of CD24+SSChigh cells carried TGEV, but only",
            "2% cells were infected with TGEV in other cell types, such as all, CD24\u2212 and CD24+SSClow IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 5b). It suggests that TGEV selectively targets to CD24+SSChigh cells for initial invasion.",
            "APN (CD13) as its receptor for cell invasion (Supplementary Fig. S5b). Since TGEV mainly targets Paneth cells for initial invasion, we detected TGEV receptor APN expression in different cell types (Fig. 5c). FACS results showed only about 1.5% cells were CD13 positive in IPEC-J2 cells. However, 42.8% CD24+SSChigh cells and 32.7% CD24+SSClow cells expressed CD13. Notably, almost no CD13 was expressed in other IPEC-J2 cells (CD24\u2212 cells) (Fig. 5c). Subsequently, removing CD13+ cells from IPEC-J2 cells by using FACS markedly decreased TGEV infection by 60%. As expected, additional supplementation of CD13+ cells in IPEC-J2 cells significantly promoted TGEV infection (Fig. 5d). Removing CD13+ cells didn\u2019t affect the number of CD24+SSChigh and CD24+SSClow cells in CD13+-removed",

Hence, there were no significant decreases in the number of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs, CD24+SSChigh and CD24+SSClow cells, even with TGEV infection (Supplementary Fig. S6c and Fig. S7a).",

            "Naturally, viruses encoded proteins, which determine their epidemiological characteristic and pathogenesis, there is no exception for TGEV. To reveal which TGEVencoded protein mediates Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs fate decision. 23 TGEV encode genes (NSP1-NSP16, ORF3a, ORF3b, M, N, E, S and ORF7) were cloned and constructed within stable cell lines in IPEC-J2 cells. Cell proliferation (KI67 staining), CD24 cell number and Notch signaling (DII4 and Hes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] protein level) were tested in these stable cell lines. FACS for KI67 staining showed that there are 8",
            "TGEV-encoded proteins that inhibit cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S8a), and 9 proteins that cause CD24 cells loss (Supplementary Fig. S8c). Moreover, there were 10 TGEV-encode proteins which down-regulated Notch signaling (Supplementary Fig. S8b). As represented via a Venn diagram, five TGEV encode proteins (NSP3, NSP5, NSP10, NSP16, and ORF3a) simultaneously affect cell proliferation, CD24+ cell number and Notch signaling (DII4 and Hes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] protein expression) (Fig. 6a). Among these viral proteins, NSP16 was the most significant inhibitor of cell proliferation and Notch signaling (Fig. 6b, c), and strongly decreased CD24+SSChigh and CD24+SSClow cell number (Fig. 6d). In addition, NSP16 down-regulated SI, CD24 and CgA protein level, but significantly up-regulated Muc[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] protein expression (Fig. 6b). Moreover, NSP16 decreases Olfm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] expression in NSP16 stable cell lines (Fig. 6b). Similar results were observed in TGEV-infected jejunum (Fig. 2c\u2013j). Therefore, we focused on NSP16, which mediated cell proliferation and Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs fate decision. Of note, NSP10 induces similar phenomenon to NSP16 in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig. S8).",
            "TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex not only interact with DII4 but also alter DII4 promoter activity Normally, NSP16 activity is regulated by NSP10, and forms a protein complex with NSP10 to inhibit the translation and/or stability of host proteins in other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Moreover, TGEV and TGEV-encoded NSP10 and NSP16 distinctly inhibit Notch signaling factors (DII4 and Hes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]). Therefore, we investigated whether TGEV-encoded NSP10 and/or NSP16 alter Notch signaling via interacting with these factors (DII4 and/or Hes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]). To explore this point, we performed IP experiments in NSP10 and NSP16 stable transfected IPEC-J2 cell lines, and CO-IP experiments in NSP10 and NSP16 transiently transfected HEK239T cells. Anti-Flag immunoprecipitation followed by anti-DII4 and anti-HA western blotting showed specific binding of NSP10 and NSP16 to DII4 (Fig. 7a, b), but no interactions were detected between NSP10 and Hes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] as well as NSP16 and Hes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. To further test their interactions between NSP10, NSP16 and DII4, we utilized a Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA), which can demonstrate proteinprotein interactions in situ by eliciting a fluorescent signal. PLA signals were detected in DII4-HA co-transfection with NSP10-Flag and/or NSP16-Flag cells, revealing the interaction of these proteins (Fig. 7c). We also tested for the interaction between TGEV-encoded NSP10 and NSP16 by using PLA. Indeed, NSP10 was observed to bind to NSP16 (Fig. 7c). To test whether the colocalization of NSP10, NSP16 and DII4 occurs, HEK239T cells were co-transfected with pLVX-DsRedMonomer-Flag-NSP10, pLVX-AcGFP1-Flag-NSP16, pLVX-mVenus-HA-DII4 and fixed at 36 h post transfection. The results showed that NSP16 not only co-localized with NSP10, but also co-localized with DII4 (Fig. 7d), which further confirmed the interaction between TGEVencoded NSP10, NSP16 and DII4.

            "To reveal the potential mechanism of NSP10 and NSP16 in reducing DII4 protein level, we cloned a fragment spanning \u2212310 bp to +1 bp (P1) of the DII4 predicted promoter into the pGL3-Basic vector (Fig. 7e). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with P1, Prl-TK (Renilla luciferase control reporter vectors), Vector, NSP10 and/or NSP16. We found that NSP10 robustly down-regulates DII4 promoter (P1) activity. However, NSP16 did not alter the transcriptional activity of DII4 promoter (Fig. 7f). Subsequently, we divided DII4 promoter (P1) into three sections (Fig. 7e) and detected the promoter activity of these fragments by using dualluciferase reporter system. NSP10 was observed to inhibit the promoter activity of three different DII4 promoter fragments by about 50\u201360% (Fig. 7g). Although NSP16 slightly enhanced the DII4 promoter (P2) activity by about 10%, NSP10 still inhibited the DII4 promoter (P2) activity even in the presence of NSP16 (Fig. 7g)."

        "Discussion": [
            "It is now well established that intestinal crypt cells respond to damage induced by high-dose irradiation or chemicals by activation of reserve stem cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Here, we reveal intestinal crypt cells exhibit a novel response to a diarrheal virus (Fig. 8). In this study we found that TGEV infection results in villous atrophy within 48 h and inhibits intestinal epithelium renewal by halting the selfrenewal and differentiation of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs. As the epithelium of the intestine is the fastest renewing tissue, sustained by Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs28, once Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs lose the ability of self-renewal and diferentiation, it will seriously affect intestinal epithelium turnover and perturb intestinal homeostasis. A recent report similarly showed that Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection causes Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs loss through activating IFN-\u03b3 generation and induces fetal-like reversion in the intestinal stem-cell niche[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs are apoptosis sensitive cells to different types of stresses (such as ROS), so it is easy to be attacked[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Previous study demonstrated that TGEV-encoded N protein induced ROS generation, which contributes to cell apoptosis activation via p53 signaling in ST cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. Although TGEV induces mildly ROS production in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, it robustly promotes ROS generation in Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs (data not shown), which provides a potential explanation of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs loss and why more apoptosis cells were observed in crypt.",
            "Except for cell apoptosis, TGEV-mediated Paneth cells loss also contributes to the developmental fate of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs. TGEV directly invades Paneth cells through the APN receptor, and then activates ROS generation, which ultimately induces Paneth cells apoptosis. Paneth cell loss severely affects the niche factors secretion (such as Wnt and Notch factors) needed for Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs self-renewal and differentiation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Among these niche factors, Notch factor is often linked to developmental patterning[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], intestinal stem-cell self-renewal and crypt homeostasis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Although a few studies shown that Paneth cells are dispensable for survival, proliferation, and stem-cell activity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. This because the other cell type severs the same function as paneth cells, such as mesenchymal cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Beyond stimulating Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs cells with niche signals, Paneth cells also provide essential nutrients to ISCs1. Therefore, paneth cells are essential for Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs. In our study TGEV infection significantly down-regulates Notch ligand DII4 and Notch effector Hes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] protein expression both in vitro and in vivo. Inactivation of DII4 causes the loss of stem and progenitor cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Thus, Paneth cells loss, affecting Notch signaling activation, may be the foundational mechanism of TGEV-mediated inhibition of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs self-renewal and differentiation.",
            "Notch signaling is a developmental switch for intestinal secretory cells and absorptive enterocytes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], as its suppression leads to a block of differentiation of enterocytes and a dramatic increase in the number of goblet cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>].",
            "As villus are mainly composed of enterocytes, TGEV infection most likely causes villous atrophy. Indeed, TGEV infection promotes progenitor cells differentiation to goblet cells at the cost of absorptive cells in TGEVinfected jejunum. TGEV infection causes villous atrophy within a short time (generally within 48 h), and the villusheight/crypt-depth ratio rapidly changed from 7:1 to 1:136. Intriguingly, TGEV infection promotes goblet cells differentiation and accompanies an increase of mucins secretion. Contrary to the luminal protection of gastrointestinal tract, mucins have the ability to promote TGEV infection. As mucins are rich in sialic acids[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>], they are interaction partners for TGEV and thus may help to penetrate the mucus layer to gain access to APN on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. Thus, over time, the more TGEV enters into intestinal epithelium, the more severe damage occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum. A circle promoting infection is then gradually formed within 24 h of TGEV infection. This is, at least in part, reason for villous sharp shortness and high mortality of TGEV infection. Thus, the mucins are a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d that needs to be balanced gently. Base on these results, it is not difficult to find that the disruption of TGEV mainly occur in crypt, and villous atrophy is the ultimate result of crypt damage. This \u201cfrom bottom to top\u201d finding of TGEV pathogenesis to intestine is quite novel to the traditional \u201ctop down\u201d understanding of TGEV infection that villus damage occurs first and damage to crypt next. Together, our data suggests that the Notch pathway might represent the cell developmental \u201cswitch\u201d of Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs and Paneth cells in the case of TGEV infection. Therefore, Notch signaling may be an attractive therapeutic target for TGEV infection. The fact that Notch signaling controls key steps of differentiation in most and has become therapeutic targets for many diseases[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>].",
            "Subsequently, we found that TGEV-encoded NSP16 significantly attenuates Notch signaling (DII4 and Hes5) activation. NSP16, a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase) plays a crucial role for 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral mRNA in capping of viral RNA, which permits viral infection with reduced host recognition[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. The absence of 2\u2032-O-methylation or NSP16 mutant activates a more robust type I IFN response that ablates viral infection and replication[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. Thus, capping of viral RNA by NSP16 is an effective and successful strategy to disrupt host immune recognition. For TGEV, its encoded NSP16 not only helps itself to evade host recognition, which promotes TGEV infection and replication, but also inhibits Notch signaling via inhibiting the DII4 promoter activity, and ultimately disrupts intestinal homeostasis. Generally, COVs NSP16 activity is strictly dependent on its interaction with NSP1042,43, this is no exception for TGEV. TGEV-encoded NSP10 interaction with NSP16 to prevent virus infection by cell innate immunity mechanisms. Inhibition of NSP10/NSP16 MTase activities by A MTase specific inhibitor AdoHcy significantly inhibits TGEV infection and replication (data not shown). Additionally, NSP10, NSP16 and their complex can interact with DII4, which normally binds to Notch receptors. This interaction may disturb Notch signaling. Notably, NSP10 not only binds to DII4, but also down-regulates DII4 promoter activity, which provides a good explanation of TGEV and its NSP10 and/or NSP16-mediated DII4 mRNA and protein decrease. Therefore, NSP10/NSP16 complex is likely another novel therapeutic target for TGEV infection.",
            "In summary, our findings highlight a link between intestinal crypt cells response and virus infection that regulates Paneth cells function and Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs fate. TGEV infection causes loss of Notch signaling, which inhibits Lgr[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] ISCs self-renewal and differentiation and causes villous atrophy. This phenomenon can also be regarded as an explanation of TGEV pathogenicity, and possibly represents similar pathways used by other diarrheal virus (such as rotavirus) and bacteria, to disrupt intestinal homeostasis. Given its central role in TGEV infection, Notch signaling is an attractive therapeutic target for TGEV infection. Future studies will explore how intestinal crypt regenerates the damaged gut with diarrheal virus infection."
