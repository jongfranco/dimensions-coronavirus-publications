        "abstract": "Background: Community\u2013acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the leading worldwide causes of childhood morbidity and mortality. Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization.\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0\u201318 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests.\nResults: MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children < 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2\u201318 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia, and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia.\n(Continued on next page)",

            "This study has some limitations. First, there might have been selection bias due to not including all cases of CAP in Korean children. Second, some patients might have been misclassified into the \u201cno MP pneumonia and no respiratory virus detection\u201d group due to a sampling error, including inappropriate sputum specimens or lack of repetitive follow-up of MP-specific IgM in patients with an initial negative result for MP-specific IgM. Due to the retrospective study design, all techniques of RTPCR for detection of respiratory viruses and MP and serology for MP were not performed in all participants. In the present study, we did not include CAP caused by typical bacterial pathogens; therefore, we could not identify time-dependent changes in the occurrence of CAP caused by typical bacterial pathogens alone or caused by co-infection of typical bacteria and viruses. However, following the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the disease burden due to bacterial pneumonia has been significantly decreased [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Therefore, we clinically defined the MSMP, MRMP, and MLEP pneumonia groups solely based on fever duration after initiation of the administration of macrolides, regardless of the results of the in vitro tests for macrolide sensitivity. Because the results of in vitro sensitivity tests to antibiotics do not always correspond with those of in vivo sensitivity tests of the same antibiotics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] and administration of immune-modulators might play more important roles in the treatment of MP pneumonia in some cases, the application of clinical classifications of MP pneumonia, rather than the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests, might be more helpful in the management of MP pneumonia. This is especially significant in cases of MLEP and MRMP pneumonia, in this era with a high rate of antibiotic-refractory MP."

The relatively lower rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia, contrary to the known high prevalence of macrolide-refractory MP pneumonia, highlights the appropriate treatment strategies for patients with MP pneumonia. The results of the present study may aid in establishing treatment and management strategies for pediatric CAP and policies to reduce the disease burden by improving public health policies for children with CAP."

        "Discussion": [
            "We evaluated the annual and seasonal patterns in respiratory etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization between 2010 to 2015 in a nationwide retrospective cohort study. The most common causes of hospitalization due to pediatric CAP were MP and RSV, with peaks in October\u2013November and November\u2013December, respectively. There were two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015) during the study period. In children hospitalized with CAP due to MP pneumonia, the monthly rates of clinical MRMP and MLEP pneumonias showed increasing trends, together comprising up to 36% of the total cases of MP pneumonia during the study period. In children less than 2 years of age, RSV was the most common cause of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization, whereas the most common cause was MP in children older than 2 years as well as in adolescents. The rate of children admitted to the intensive care unit was highest in children with RSV pneumonia, followed by those with AdV pneumonia. Ventilator care was most commonly needed in children with AdV pneumonia, followed by those with RSV pneumonia. The results of the present study provide fundamental data on the periodicity of epidemics of pathogens that cause pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization.",
            "In the present study, we found that RSV was the most common cause of CAP in children younger than 2 years of age, which is consistent with the findings of other studies performed in other countries, regardless of the detection methods used or national income levels of the children who were analyzed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The immune response in RSV infection differs according to age [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "ALT alanine aminotransferase, AST aspartate aminotransferase, CRP C-reactive protein, ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Hb hemoglobin, ICU intensive care unit, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, MP Mycoplasma pneumoniae, NA not applicable, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, SD standard deviation, WBC white blood cell count aGroup 1, MP pneumonia; group 2, MP co-infected with virus; group 3, adenovirus; group 4, influenza virus; group 5, Metapneumovirus; group 6, RSV; The inequality or equal signs mean the rank order of post hoc analyses bPost hoc analyses were used to examine if the characteristics of MP pneumonia groups were statistically significant with chi-squared test. For the continuous variables, one-way ANOVA tests were conducted to compare groups, followed by Mann-Whitney U test",
            "Notably, inefficient and ineffective immune responses in early life contribute to more severe clinical courses and higher incidence of RSV infection; this is especially problematic in infants, who are most frequently affected by RSV pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. These findings may be valuable to guide therapeutic approaches, such as application of immune-modulatory drugs for enhancement of immune responses, and preventive strategies for children with CAP; moreover, the results of the present study suggest that the development of strategies to prevent RSV infection, especially in infants and younger children, might aid in decreasing the worldwide disease burden due to CAP.",
            "The number of children hospitalized with MP pneumonia was typically highest between October and November. In the previous studies, the peak incidence of",
            "MP pneumonia showed a similar pattern to that observed in the present study, regardless of age [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. However, in the 2011 Korean epidemic, the peak rate of hospitalization due to MP pneumonia in children occurred in September, whereas the peak rate in the 2015 epidemic occurred in November. In addition, the number of children hospitalized with MP pneumonia in the 2015 epidemic was smaller than that in the 2011 epidemic. These findings were consistent with the results of another study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. The reasons for these phenomenon may be associated with exposure to MP in the previous epidemic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
            "Based on in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests, the macrolide resistance rates of MP pneumonia have recently been identified as 50\u201390% in Asia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]; these rates differ dramatically among nations. When we defined clinical MSMP, MLEP, and MRMP according to fever duration after the initiation of macrolides in each pneumonia episode, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests, the ratios of clinical MLEP and MRMP of total MP pneumonia showed increasing trends after adjustment for monthly time series. However, the estimated clinical MRMP/total MP pneumonia ratio during the study period in the present study (0.0\u2013 11.0%) was far lower than that based on in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests (50\u201390%, especially in Asia) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Therefore, the results of our present study suggest that the clinical response to macrolides in MP pneumonia in the real world might not be as weak as that has been reported, based on in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests, which could partially be due to the self-limiting features of MP infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Due to the high prevalence of MRMP, there are a great deal of concerns regarding second-line treatment options for MRMP, including tetracycline or fluoroquinolones [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Some previous studies have reported no significant differences with respect to clinical and radiologic findings between MRMP and MSMP pneumonia in children [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. When combined with the results of the present and previous studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], a considerable proportion of cases of macrolide-resistant MP pneumonia might be recategorized as clinical MSMP or MLEP pneumonia. Therefore, the first-line treatment for MP pneumonia can be initially started, even in cases of MRMP pneumonia. Considering the exaggerated immune response in children with MP pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], the application of immunemodulators, such as corticosteroids or immunoglobulin, rather than antibiotics, might play more important roles in the management of MP pneumonia, even in some cases of MLEP or MRMP pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. When selecting the proper treatment strategy for MLEP and MRMP pneumonia, consideration of diverse clinical courses, including self-limiting features and combined immune responses in each case, might be more important than the results of in vitro sensitivity tests to macrolide.",
            "This study has some limitations. First, there might have been selection bias due to not including all cases of CAP in Korean children. Second, some patients might have been misclassified into the \u201cno MP pneumonia and no respiratory virus detection\u201d group due to a sampling error, including inappropriate sputum specimens or lack of repetitive follow-up of MP-specific IgM in patients with an initial negative result for MP-specific IgM. Due to the retrospective study design, all techniques of RTPCR for detection of respiratory viruses and MP and serology for MP were not performed in all participants. In the present study, we did not include CAP caused by typical bacterial pathogens; therefore, we could not identify time-dependent changes in the occurrence of CAP caused by typical bacterial pathogens alone or caused by co-infection of typical bacteria and viruses. However, following the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the disease burden due to bacterial pneumonia has been significantly decreased [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Therefore, we clinically defined the MSMP, MRMP, and MLEP pneumonia groups solely based on fever duration after initiation of the administration of macrolides, regardless of the results of the in vitro tests for macrolide sensitivity. Because the results of in vitro sensitivity tests to antibiotics do not always correspond with those of in vivo sensitivity tests of the same antibiotics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] and administration of immune-modulators might play more important roles in the treatment of MP pneumonia in some cases, the application of clinical classifications of MP pneumonia, rather than the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests, might be more helpful in the management of MP pneumonia. This is especially significant in cases of MLEP and MRMP pneumonia, in this era with a high rate of antibiotic-refractory MP."
