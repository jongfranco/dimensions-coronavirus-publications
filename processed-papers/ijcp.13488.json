        "abstract": "In the space of just six weeks, a new coronavirus, from a family that historically was not viewed as a global health concern, has become daily headline news around the globe. The 21st century marked its arrival with the emergence of three previously unknown coronaviruses. SARSCoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) was recognized in November 2002 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in June 2012 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and 2019-nCoV in December 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Previously, human coronaviruses, known since the 1960s, were viewed as being only marginally relevant to the clinic, except for infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. What these, and several other recent outbreaks have in common, is how fast they circled the world. Outbreaks that centuries ago needed weeks or months to spread globally can today reach any continent within days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. The first, spring wave of the 1918 Spanish Flu, at a time when travel by ship was the fastest way of transportation around the world, spread through the United States, Europe, and possibly Asia over six months [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The pandemic affected over a quarter of the world\u2019s population, caused 50-100 million deaths, more than the two World Wars combined, and caused life expectancy at birth in the United States to drop by 11.8 years between 1917 and 1918 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. In comparison, in 2002-2003 the SARS-CoV spread to 5 countries within 24 hours [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], and in 2009 the H1N1 influenza virus spread to 30 countries within 6 weeks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",

            "In the space of just six weeks, a new coronavirus, from a family that historically was not viewed as a global health concern, has become daily headline news around the globe. The 21st century marked its arrival with the emergence of three previously unknown coronaviruses. SARSCoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) was recognized in November 2002 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in June 2012 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and 2019-nCoV in December 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Previously, human coronaviruses, known since the 1960s, were viewed as being only marginally relevant to the clinic, except for infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. What these, and several other recent outbreaks have in common, is how fast they circled the world. Outbreaks that centuries ago needed weeks or months to spread globally can today reach any continent within days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. The first, spring wave of the 1918 Spanish Flu, at a time when travel by ship was the fastest way of transportation around the world, spread through the United States, Europe, and possibly Asia over six months [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The pandemic affected over a quarter of the world\u2019s population, caused 50-100 million deaths, more than the two World Wars combined, and caused life expectancy at birth in the United States to drop by 11.8 years between 1917 and 1918 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. In comparison, in 2002-2003 the SARS-CoV spread to 5 countries within 24 hours [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], and in 2009 the H1N1 influenza virus spread to 30 countries within 6 weeks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "In the most recent of the three coronavirus outbreaks, several clusters of patients with pneumonia started to be reported on December 8, 2019 from Wuhan, China, and most of them were epidemiologically linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. The market was closed on January 1, 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. By February 11, 2020, the virus, 2019-nCoV, was reported from >28 countries and special administrative regions, affected >43,000 people, and caused 1,018 deaths [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. The ability of the virus to spread by human-to-human transmission was confirmed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. A preliminary epidemiological analysis indicates that the incubation period of 2019-nCoV is similar to that of SARS, but with a wider confidence interval, and longer than the one for the 2009 H1N1 influenza strain [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. On February 11, 2020, the disease caused by 2019-nCoV was named COVID-2019, for coronavirus disease in 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]."

            "The virus shares >70% genetic similarity with the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV strain [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], is most closely related to coronaviruses of bat origin [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], its spike glycoprotein gene appears to have emerged by recombination between a bat coronavirus and a coronavirus of unknown origins, and relative synonymous codon usage bias analyses indicate that snakes may be a potential reservoir [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "In 2019-nCoV , the presence of asparagine at position 501, which is compatible with, but not ideal for binding human ACE2, suggests that the virus has acquired the ability for human-to-human transmission, but this appears to be more limited than that of the 20022003 SARS-CoV strain [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].",
            "The mutation of this asparagine to threonine in 2019-nCoV was predicted to significantly increase the ability of the virus to bind the human ACE2 receptor and should be closely monitored for [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>].",
            "An analysis of airline passenger screenings during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic emphasized that many national authorities usually focus on preventing the import, but not the export of pathogens, even though from a contemporary perspective interventions would be globally most impactful if implemented as close as possible to the sources of an epidemic, by exit screening [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>].",
            "Some of the limitations of screening measures, in the wake of an outbreak, include denying contact with ill individuals, taking antipyretic medication to conceal fever [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>], and its reliance on the length of the incubation period of the infectious disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>].",
            "Every outbreak brings something new, provides opportunities to reap the benefits gained from past epidemics and pandemics, and provides novel lessons that will shape the framework to manage emerging infectious diseases.",
            "As the authors attempt to predict and quantitate the impact of international travel on an infectious disease outbreak, and visualize the host, environmental, and microbial factors that make some outbreaks spread faster and others have higher mortality, it is worth noting that in 2013, for the first time, the annual number of passengers exceeded three billion [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Critical questions include identifying the reservoirs, understanding the transmission route(s), defining the incubation period and the time when the virus can be transmitted, characterizing the clinical spectrum of the disease, exploring the potential of long-term health effects, and learning more about susceptible populations.",
            "For this and future outbreaks, is understanding the types of different non-pharmaceutical interventions, their combined benefit, and the best timing for their implementation."
