This study is aiming to investigate the impact of the COVID - Confirmed cases to the petrol price from the period dated January 2020 to 23 February 2020 in China. With that regard the present study used the Simple regression linear model to evaluate the impact of the COVID - Confirmed cases to the Petrol price during the period from dated January to 23 February 2020 in China. Time series data from Global Petrol Prices and China daily Statistics from the period dated 20 January to 23 February 2020 for China were used to evaluate the impact of the COVID - 19 Confirmed cases to the Petrol price in China. To investigate the impact of the COVID -19 Confirmed cases to the Petrol prices in China the study assumes the COVID -19 Confirmed cases to be the independent variable while the petrol price to be an dependent variable of the study. The findings of the study were in actual fact catching up the attention. The study findings revealed that there is a negative and insignificant impact of the COVID - Confirmed cases to the petrol prices from the period dated January 2020 to 23 February 2020 in China.",
