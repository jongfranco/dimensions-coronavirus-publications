        "abstract": "Haemophilus parasuis can elicit serious inflammatory responses, which contribute to huge economic losses to the swine industry. However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying inflammation-related damage induced by H. parasuis remain unclear. Accumulating evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important functions in the regulation of autoimmune disorders. Baicalin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-oxidant activities. In this study, we investigated whether lncRNAs were involved in the vascular injury or inflammation triggered by H. parasuis and whether baicalin regulated the lncRNA profiles of porcine aortic vascular endothelial cells (PAVECs) infected with H. parasuis. The results showed that the lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles of PAVECs were changed by H. parasuis. Important functions of lncRNAs and mRNAs were predicted. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses demonstrated that the targets of differentially expressed lncRNAs of H. parasuis infected PAVECs were mainly involved in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, apoptosis, and N-glycan biosynthesis; whereas nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, the TNF signaling pathway, and the nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B signaling pathway were enriched in PAVECs pretreated with baicalin. In addition, top hub genes and lncRNAs were identified and validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. CCL5, GBP1, and SAMHD1 were significantly upregulated after H. parasuis infection, whereas they were significantly downregulated with baicalin pretreatment. LncRNA ALDBSSCT0000001677, ALDBSSCT0000001353, MSTRG.10724.2, and ALDBSSCT0000010434 had the same expression pattern. Collectively, these data suggested that baicalin could modify changes to the lncRNAs profiles or regulate lncRNAs that participate in inflammation-related signaling pathways, thereby alleviating tissue damage or inflammatory responses induced by H. parasuis. To our best knowledge, this is the first article of H. parasuis stimulating changes to the lncRNA profiles of PAVECs and the capability of baicalin to regulate lncRNA changes in PAVECs infected with H. parasuis, which might provide a novel therapeutic target for the control of H. parasuis infection.",
