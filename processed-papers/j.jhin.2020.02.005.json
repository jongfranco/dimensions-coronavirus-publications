Sir, Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, although distant from Wuhan City and Hubei Province, the source of novel coronavirus pneumonia, is facing a challenge. Most of Zhuhai\u2019s 1.89 million citizens are migrants, who live and work in Zhuhai but go back to their hometowns for the Spring Festival. In February 2nd 2020, Zhuhai citizens returned to Zhuhai for work, among which many were from Hubei Province. After the first three cases diagnosed in January 20th, the number of novel coronavirus pneumonia patients in Zhuhai rose substantially after the Spring Festival; by Feruary 7th 2020 76 patients had been diagnosed, with many more suspected cases of asymptomatic close contacts being isolated for medical surveillance. The first three cases in Zhuhai were imported from Wuhan city, and over 78% of Zhuhai\u2019s 2019-nCoV patients were imported cases."
