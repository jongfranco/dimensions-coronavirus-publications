As a result, an outbreak occurred in Wuhan with sporadic cases in other cities and countries, and there is an increasing trend. Third, there is a low awareness of the severity of pneumonia associated with 2019-nCoV. Many patients have atypical clinical manifestations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] and visit different medical departments. Because patients might be contagious during the incubation period, many medical staff might not be fully protected and could become infected through their contact with patients. Research has shown that, in addition to droplet transmission and contact transmission, 2019-nCoV might be transmitted via the faecal\u2013 oral route.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Fourth, the reserves of protective equipment in hospitals are severely insufficient, worsened by the implementation of traffic control. A hospital\u2019s protective equipment is mainly supplied to designated infectious diseases departments and intensive care units. Medical staff in general hospitals and other departments are likely to be affected the worst because they do not have adequate protective equipment. Fifth, due to the previous medical custody control, many clinical drugs were identified as auxiliary drugs and their supply to the hospital was stopped. The general department of the hospital does not have the necessary treatment drugs, putting many medi\u00ad cal staff at risk of infection. Sixth, because all hospital beds in designated hospitals have been filled, and the new hospital in Wuhan has not been completed, many confirmed patients cannot be admitted to hospital and stay in general hospitals or go home for isolation, inevitably increasing morbidity and mortality. Seventh, in view of the current situation, to reduce cross-infection, many hospitals have cancelled outpatient appointments (except for emergency and fever clinics). This inevitably affects the diagnosis and treatment of patients with other diseases."
