This is to find a short section or sections of viral protein sequence suitable for preliminary design proposal for a peptide synthetic vaccine and a peptidomimetic therapeutic, and to explore some design possibilities. The project was originally directed towards a use case for the Q-UEL language and its implementation in a knowledge management and automated inference system for medicine called the BioIngine, but focus here remains mostly on the virus itself. However, using Q-UEL systems to access relevant and emerging literature, and to interact with standard publically available bioinformatics tools on the Internet, did help quickly identify sequences of amino acids that are well conserved across many coronaviruses including 2019-nCoV. KRSFIEDLLFNKV was found to be particularly well conserved in this study and corresponds to the region around one of the known cleavage sites of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry. This sequence motif and surrounding variations formed the basis for proposing a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. The work can, nonetheless, be described in traditional bioinformatics terms, and readily reproduced by others, albeit with the caveat that new data and research into 2019-nCoV is emerging and evolving at an explosive pace. Preliminary studies using molecular modeling and docking, and in that context the potential value of certain known herbal extracts, are also described.",

            "Barry Robson BSc(Hons) PhD DSc, Professor Emeritus Medicine was five years as Chief Scientific Officer IBM Global Healthcare, Pharmaceutical, and Life Sciences and, prior to that, six years as the Strategic Advisor at IBM Global Research Headquarters (T. J. Watson Research Centre). For most of those 11 years he held the prestigious title of IBM Distinguished Engineer. According to Barry's two page biography written by journalist Brendan Horton in Nature (389,418\u2013420, 1997), Barry was a pioneer in bioinformatics, protein modelling, and computer-aided drug design. He is the recipient of several honours including the Asklepios Award for Outstanding Vision in Science and Technology at the Future of Health Technology Congress at M.I.T. in 2002. He has helped start up several other companies or divisions in the UK and USA. Barry continues as CEO of The Dirac Foundation in the UK, and Distinguished Scientist (Admin.) at the University of Wisconsin-Stout Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. He is also cofounder of Ingine Inc., Virginia USA, a medical A.I. company. While continuing to work for, and then collaborate with IBM, he was also University Research Director and Professor of EBM, Biostatistics and Epidemiology at St. Matthew's University School of Medicine which he helped established in its earlier days in the Cayman Islands. Barry also holds a Harvard-Macy Diploma in the Business of Medical Education. Immediately prior to joining IBM in 1998 he was hired as Principal Scientist at MDL Information Systems in California to help put together the technology for the multimillion sale of a bioinformatics system to the holding company forming Craig Venter's Celera Genomics that produced the first draft of the human genome. Prior to that, he was CSO of Gryphon Sciences (later Gryphon Pharmaceuticals) in South San Francisco, California, a bio-nanotechnology ultrastructural chemistry start-up largely held and then acquired by SmithKline Beecham. Before moving to the US, Barry was the scientific founder of Proteus International plc in the UK, designing and leading the development of the PROMETHEUS Expert System and its underlying GLOBAL Expert System, bioinformatics and simulation language for drug, vaccine, and diagnostic discovery. It sold for the equivalent of $9.4 million to the pharmaceutical industry in the mid-1990s. At Proteus, he also led the team that used the above Expert System to invent and patent several diagnostics and vaccines including the Mad Cow disease diagnostic subsequently marketed worldwide by Abbott. He has over 300 scientific publications in Nature, Science, J. Mol. Biol. Biochemical J., including some 50 patents and two books: \u201cThe Engines of Hippocrates. From the Dawn of Medicine to Medical and Pharmaceutical Informatics\u201d Robson and Baek, 2009, Wiley, 600 pages)\u201d and \u201cIntroduction to Proteins and Protein Engineering\u201d (B. Robson and J. Garnier, 1984, 1988, Elsevier, 700 pages). He has contributed to several reports to governments (EU, US, Denmark) including Panels of the National Innovation Initiative for \u201cInnovate America\u201d published by The Council on Competitiveness, Washington D.C. (2004) as a whitepaper to the President of the United States. He was also an advisor in relation to a major scientific computer-aided drug design collaboration and network for Peter Feinstein Consultants between work between US scientists and the Russian Science City Arzamas. For five years, Barry was a Nature \u201cNews and Views\u201d Correspondent on biomolecules. He was Visiting Scholar Stanford University School of Medicine 1997\u20131998, Professorial Lecturer Mount Sinai NYC during part of his period at IBM Corporation, and held visiting positions and professorships in INRA and U. Paris-Sud France, and a Technical University of Copenhagen under Sir Rodney Cotterill, as well a postdoctoral position at Oxford (Wolfson College) under Sir David Phillips while Reader in Biochemistry at the University of Manchester."
