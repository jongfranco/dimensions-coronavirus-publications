        "abstract": "Design and application of epitope-based polyvalent vaccines have recently garnered attention as an efficient alternative for conventional vaccines. We previously have reported the in silico design of HHP antigen which encompasses the immune-dominant epitopes of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C core protein (HCVcp) and Poliovirus viral proteins (VPs). It has been shown that the HHP has desirable conformation to expose the epitopes, high antigenicity and other desired physicochemical and immunological properties. To confirm the accuracy of these predictions, the ex-vivo immunogenicity of the HHP was assessed. The HHP gene was chemically synthesized in pET28a and expressed in E. coli (BL21). The expressed protein was purified and its immunological potency was evaluated on dendritic cells (DCs) as antigen presenting cells (APCs). Functional analysis was assessed in co-cultivation of autologous T-cells with matured DCs (mDCs). T-cell activation, proliferation and cytokines secretion were evaluated using flowcytometry and ELISA methods. Our results indicated that the HHP could induce the DC maturation. The mDCs were able to trigger T-cell activation and proliferation.",
