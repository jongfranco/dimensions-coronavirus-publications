            "Hong Kong is a former British colony and a city situated in a small (426 m2iles) area officially designated as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People\u2019s Republic of China. With a population of over 7.4 million, it has one of the highest population densities in the world. The geography of Hong Kong includes: (i) Hong Kong island, (ii) the Kowloon Peninsula and (iii) the New Territories which borders mainland China. It also consists of multiple islands, including the Lantau Island (the site of the Hong Kong International Airport). The busiest boundary control point with mainland China is in the New Territories at Lo Wu, where estimates from previous years indicate that around 239,000 passengers may be expected to cross daily during the Chinese New Year (CNY) period.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] The closest city on the other side is Shenzhen within the Guangdong Province, and there are many people who work in Hong Kong and live in Shenzhen, commuting across the border each day.",
            "At the time of writing, 14 cases of the 2019-nCoV have been confirmed in Hong Kong and all are currently being managed at the designated infectious disease center - Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH). The first case was detected on 23 January 2020 and the most recent one was on the 1 February 2020. Most of these cases were residents from mainland China: Wuhan (7/14=50%) and Shenzhen (1/14=7.1%), visiting Hong Kong while the remaining 6 cases are Hong Kong citizens (Fig. 1).",
            "At least two of these 14 cases had not travelled to the mainland China, including Wuhan, within the 14-day maximum incubation period of 2019-nCoV. They may therefore represent cases of inter-person transmission, having acquired their infections from infected individuals with such a travel history. Several cases of interperson transmission have been reported in the other countries (including Japan, Germany and the United States).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] This has also been reported in a family from Shenzhen who visited Wuhan (but not any wet markets) then infected one family member who had not travelled upon their return.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] This Hong Kong cohort also consists of two husband-and-wife couples and a family of three (husband, wife and adult daughter), all of whom had a travel history to Wuhan.",
            "The mean age of these 14 Hong Kong cases was 59.8 (S.D. 13.4) years and most (9/14 = 64.3%) were male. 12/14 (85.7%) cases presented with fever (including 5 with cough, 1 with blocked nose, 1 with muscle aches, and the remaining 2 afebrile cases exhibited coughing and shortness of breath). 10/14 (71.4%) cases presented to the Accident and Emergency departments in Hong Kong to seek care, 2/14 (14.3%) were intercepted by the Hong Kong Department of Health teams (using thermal imaging or temperature screening at border control points), and 2/14 (14.3%) developed symptoms and tested positive for 2019-nCoV during quarantine as a contact of a confirmed case. At present, 3/14 (21.4%) cases are in the intensive care unit (ICU) whereas the other 11 cases are clinically stable at PMH. An earlier report[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] on some of the earliest cases of 2019nCoV infection also describes a higher proportion of cases to be male (30/41=73%), with a slightly higher proportion (13/41=32%) requiring ICU monitoring \u2013 though it is still yet possible that more Hong Kong cases may deteriorate and require ICU admission.",
            "What do these early cases imply for Hong Kong? The period over which these cases were detected (23 January to 1 February 2020) includes the week before and the week after the CNY (starting from 25 January 2020). Does this suggest that this period represents the highest incidence of cases developing in Hong Kong because the highest intensity of population movement occurs over CNY, and that this may be expected to decrease once the celebrations are over? Not necessarily, we think, as many of the normal CNY activities in Hong Kong and mainland China were quite severely curtailed to limit the potential spread of this infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] In which case, these incidence figures may represent more of the baseline rate of 2019-nCoV cases appearing in Hong Kong. Indeed, a closer look at Fig. 1 suggests that Hong Kong is already experiencing some degree of local inter-person transmission, as the earlier cases were associated with travel to Wuhan and other parts of mainland China, but the more recent cases involved no recent travel to these affected areas.",
            "to limit the number of potentially infected cases entering Hong Kong.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] This strategy is controversial and our current modelling work is exploring its potential impact."
