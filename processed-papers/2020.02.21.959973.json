        "abstract": "The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. All our analyses are fully documented at https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2.",

            "Analysis: Writing: System design: Tool development: Infrastructure design: Funding: The current state of much of the Wuhan pneumonia virus (COVID-19) research shows a regrettable lack of data sharing and considerable analytical obfuscation. This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises. All our analyses are fully documented at https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>The initial publications describing genomic features of COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]used Illumina and Oxford nanopore data to elucidate the sequence composition of patient specimens (although only Wu et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]explicitly provided the accession numbers for their raw short read sequencing data). However, their approaches to processing, assembly, and analysis of raw data differed widely (Table 1) and ranged from transparent [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]to entirely opaque [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Such lack of analytical transparency sets a dangerous precedent. Infectious disease outbreaks often occur in locations where infrastructure necessary for data analysis may be inaccessible or unbiased interpretation of results may be politically untenable. As a consequence, there is a global need to ensure access to free, open, and robust analytical approaches that can be used by anyone in the world to analyze, interpret, and share data. Can existing tools and computational resources support such a global need? Here we show that they can: we analyzed all available raw COVID-19 data to demonstrate that analyses described in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]can be reproduced on public infrastructure using open source tools by any researcher with an Internet connection."
