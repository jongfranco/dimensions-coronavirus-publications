        "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are among the most toxic proteins. Vaccination is an effective strategy to prevent botulism. To generate a vaccine suitable for human use, a recombinant non-His-tagged isoform of the Hc domain of botulinum neurotoxin serotype E (rEHc) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by sequential chromatography. The immunogenicity of rEHc was evaluated in mice and doseand time-dependent immune responses were observed in both antibody titers and protective potency. Then, the pilot-scale expression and purification of rEHc were performed, and its immunological activity was characterized. Our results showed rEHc has good immunogenicity and can elicit strong protective potency against botulinum neurotoxin serotype E (BoNT/E) in mice, indicating that rEHc is an effective botulism vaccine candidate. Further, we developed a novel antitoxin against BoNT/E by purifying F(ab)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] from pepsin-digested serum IgG of rEHc-inoculated horses. The protective effect of the F(ab)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] antitoxin was determined in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that our F(ab)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] antitoxin can prevent botulism in BoNT/E-challenged mice and effectively alleviate the progression of paralysis caused by BoNT/E to achieve therapeutic effects. Therefore, our results provide valuable experimental data for the production of a novel antitoxin, which is a promising candidate for the treatment of BoNT/E-induced botulism.",

            "In conclusion, we successfully expressed and purified a non-His-tagged rEHc protein in E.coli. The results showed that rEHc is immunologically active and can elicit a strong immune response to protect mice from BoNT/E challenge, indicating that rEHc represents a good potential candidate subunit vaccine for human use. Thereafter, we demonstrated the strategy for the development of a potent novel botulinum antitoxin using rEHc as an immunogen. The F(ab)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] antitoxin produced from rEHc-immunized horses is effective in the prevention and treatment of BoNT/E intoxication."

            "Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease caused by botulinum neurotoxins, which are produced primarily by the Grampositive, spore-forming bacterium Clostridium botulinum.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Naturally occurring botulism in human is caused by serotypes A, B, E and F, while illness in birds, cattle, and horses are caused by type C, D, and G. However, all seven serotypes are lethal to humans. Botulism neurotoxins (BoNTs) are currently known to be the most toxic proteins to humans.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]<br/><br/>Botulinum neurotoxins of various serotypes are structurally and functionally similar. Botulinum toxin is initially synthesized as a 150-kDa protein. It is then cleaved into a 50kDa light chain and a 100-kDa heavy chain joined by a disulfide bond. Each BoNT consists three functional domains: the N-terminal catalytic domain (light chain, L domain, 50 kDa), the internal translocation domain (N-terminal of heavy chain, Hn domain, 50-kDa), and the C-terminal receptor-binding domain (C-terminal of heavy chain, Hc domain, 50-kDa).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] The intoxication process is divided into three steps. First, the Hc of BoNT binds to the neuronal membrane on the presynaptic side of the peripheral synapse. Then, the receptor-bound toxin is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The light chain of the toxin passes through the endocytic vesicle membrane and enters the cytoplasm. Once inside the cell, the light chain, which is identified as a zinc endopeptidase, cleaves polypeptides that are essential for neurotransmitter release. Subsequently, the extracellular release of neurotransmitters into the neuromuscular junction is blocked, resulting in a flaccid muscular paralysis that can ultimately lead to death.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]"

            "Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are among the most toxic proteins. Vaccination is an effective strategy to prevent botulism. To generate a vaccine suitable for human use, a recombinant non-His-tagged isoform of the Hc domain of botulinum neurotoxin serotype E (rEHc) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by sequential chromatography. The immunogenicity of rEHc was evaluated in mice and doseand time-dependent immune responses were observed in both antibody titers and protective potency. Then, the pilot-scale expression and purification of rEHc were performed, and its immunological activity was characterized. Our results showed rEHc has good immunogenicity and can elicit strong protective potency against botulinum neurotoxin serotype E (BoNT/E) in mice, indicating that rEHc is an effective botulism vaccine candidate. Further, we developed a novel antitoxin against BoNT/E by purifying F(ab)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] from pepsin-digested serum IgG of rEHc-inoculated horses. The protective effect of the F(ab)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] antitoxin was determined in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that our F(ab)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] antitoxin can prevent botulism in BoNT/E-challenged mice and effectively alleviate the progression of paralysis caused by BoNT/E to achieve therapeutic effects. Therefore, our results provide valuable experimental data for the production of a novel antitoxin, which is a promising candidate for the treatment of BoNT/E-induced botulism."

            "Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are one of the most toxic proteins, which are easy to manufacture, deliver, and weaponize. BoNTs have been developed as biological warfare agents by many countries and organizations. Thus, developing suitable drugs for the prevention and treatment of Botulism in order to deal with the potential bio-security threats is very urgent. In previous studies, the colleagues have established a strategy of cloning the Hc gene of botulinum neurotoxin into an expression vector to express and purify recombinant non-His-tagged Hc protein. Purification and characterization of the recombinant Hc proteins of serotypes A, B and F have been completed, demonstrating good safety and efficacy against botulism.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]",
            "In this study, we presented the production and evaluation of a recombinant non-His-tagged Hc subunit vaccine as a candidate subunit vaccine for human use against BoNT/E. The prokaryotic expression vector pTIG-Trx-EHc was successfully constructed. Recombinant EHc (rEHc) protein was highly expressed in E. coli and purified by sequential chromatography. The potency of rEHc against BoNT/E was assessed in mice. The results showed that rEHc formulated with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was efficacious in eliciting protective antibodies against natural BoNT/E. Mice with two immunizations were protected against 102 LD50 BoNT/E but partly protected against 103 LD50 BoNT/E with relatively low (4.31\u20135.06) geometric mean titers (GMT). After the third immunization, the group GMT (5.27\u20135.91) increased significantly and all of these mice survived 103 LD50 BoNT/E challenge. These results indicate that rEHc has a functionally active conformation and represents a good subunit candidate vaccine against BoNT/E.",
            "Since rEHc is a suitable candidate vaccine, large quantities of rEHc will eventually be needed. Thus, in this study, pilotscale production of rEHc was carried out. A pilot-scale rEHc expression and purification protocol were established. After four purification steps, each pilot-scale purification yielded approximately 900 mg rEHc with a purity of up to 95% based on HPLC analysis. Mouse assay results demonstrated that the pilot-scale rEHc has good immunogenicity and can effectively elicit protective antibodies against BoNT/E. Mice with two or three doses of rEHc were completely protected against 103 LD50 or 104 LD50 of BoNT/E challenge, respectively. To further evaluate the immunogenicity of rEHc and determine the ED50 of the pilot-scale rEHc, mice were i.m. injected with a range of 0.0039 \u03bcg to 4 \u03bcg of four-fold diluted rEHc. Mice injected with two doses of \u22651\u03bcg EHc were completely protected against 103 LD50 of BoNT/E. The ED50 was calculated to be 0.256 \u03bcg with two doses. In conclusion, the rEHc antigen has a correct sequence, molecular weight and specific immunological activity. Thereafter, serval batches of pilot-scale rEHc were prepared, and the stock solutions were verified by ELISA, DNA dot blot, culture method and Gel Limulus reagent method.",
            "Botulinum antitoxin is the only effective post-exposure therapy and defense method against BoNT. The antitoxin currently available for the treatment of botulism is equine antitoxin, which consists of purified F(ab)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] fragments derived from horses immunized with a formaldehyde-inactivated toxin (toxoid). However, aside from the fact that there are many disadvantages in the production of the toxoid, the main problem of this method is that it may induce toxin-binding but non-neutralizing antibodies. The non-neutralizing antibodies reduce the potency of the antitoxin preparations, which can result in the need for high doses and may cause serious side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop safe and highly potent novel botulinum antitoxins. A potential solution to this problem is to immune animals with nontoxic recombinant BoNT fragment, such as the Hc domain of BoNT. The Hc domain is nontoxic and contains key neutralizing epitopes that are effective in inducing strong neutralizing antibodies against BoNTs. Therefore, the Hc domain may represent good immunogen to replace the toxoid for the production of antitoxins.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]",

The rEHc antigen was used to immune horses to prepare equine serum with high neutralizing antibody titers. After multiple purification steps, the IgG was successfully digested and F(ab)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] fragment with high purity (85.6%), and high protein content (32.9 mg/ml) was obtained. The neutralizing potency of the F(ab)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] fragment against BoNT/E was 2000 IU/ml or 60.8 IU/mg. Furthermore, the in vivo potency assay results suggested that the novel antitoxin is effective in the treatment and prevention of BoNT/E intoxication in a mouse model and the therapeutic and protective effects are time- and dose-dependent. Early treatment, especially before obvious paralysis, was most effective in preventing paralysis progression and protecting exposed mice from BoNT/E. Additionally, mice that survived 1 h after intoxication by treating with F(ab\u2019)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] antitoxin showed a significant improvement in survival after treatment with another dose of antitoxin. Therefore, our result indicated that the rEHc antigen is a highly potent immunogen in inducing high titer of neutralizing antibodies against BoNT/E. And the novel F(ab\u2019)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] antitoxin is a potential therapeutic drug for the prevention and treatment of BoNT/E.",
