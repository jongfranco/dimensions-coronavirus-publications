        "abstract": "BackgroundsAn ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city of China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.MethodsAccounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (\u03b3), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI.FindingsThe early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0.ConclusionThe mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.",

As of January 26 (17:00 GMT), 2020, there have been 2033 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections in mainland China, including 56 deaths [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].

The coefficient of determination, R-squared, ranges from 0.91 to 0.92 for all reporting rate changing scenarios, which implies that the early outbreak data were largely following the exponential growth. In Table1, we estimated that the R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 5.71 (95%CI: 4.24-7.54) associated with 8-fold to 0-fold increase in the reporting rate. All R0 estimates are significantly larger than 1, which indicates the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks. Since the official diagnostic protocol was released by WHO on January 17 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], an increase in the diagnosis and reporting of 2019-nCoV infections probably occurred. Thereafter, the daily number of newly reported cases started increasing around January 17, see Fig 1, which implies that more infections were likely being diagnosed and recorded. We suggested that changing in reporting might exist, and thus it should be considered in the estimation, i.e., 8-, 4- and 2-fold changes are more likely than no change in the reporting efforts. Although six scenarios about the reporting rate were explored in this study, the real situation is difficult to determine given limited data and (almost) equivalent model fitting performance in terms of Rsquared. However, with increasing reporting rate, we found the mean R0 is likely to be around 2 and 3. Our analysis and estimation of R0 rely on the accuracy of the SI of 2019-nCoV, which remains unknown as of January 25. In this work, we employed the SIs of SARS and MERS as approximations to that of 2019-nCoV. The determination of SI requires the knowledge of the chain of disease transmission that needs sufficient number of patient samples and periods of time for follow-up [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], and thus this is unlikely to be achieved shortly. However, using SIs of SARS and MERS as approximation could provide an insight to the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV at the early stage of the outbreak. We reported that the mean R0 of 2019nCoV is likely to be from 2.24 (8-fold) to 3.58 (2-fold), and it is largely in the range of those of SARS, i.e., 25 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], and MERS, i.e., 2.7-3.9 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. We note that WHO reported the basic reproduction number for the human-to-human (direct) transmission ranged from 1.4 to 2.5 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], which is marginally lower than ours. However, many of existing online preprints estimate the mean R0 ranging from 2 to 5 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], which is largely consistent with our results."

            "Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city of China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. Methods: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (\u03b3), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. Findings: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0. Conclusion: The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and significantly larger than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks."

            "The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported and confirmed in Wuhan, China in December 31, 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. As of January 26 (17:00 GMT), 2020, there have been 2033 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections in mainland China, including 56 deaths [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].

            "To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing peer-reviewed literature quantifying the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV as of January 22, 2020. In this study, we estimated the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV via the basic reproduction number, R0, based on the limited data in the early phase of the outbreak."

The nonlinear least square (NLS) framework is adopted for data fitting and parameter estimation. The intrinsic growth rate (\u03b3) of the exponential growth was estimated, and the basic reproduction number could be obtained by R0 = 1/M(\u2212\u03b3) with 100% susceptibility for 2019-nCoV at this early stage. The function M(\u2219) is the Laplace transform, i.e., the moment generating function, of the probability distribution for the serial interval (SI) of the disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], denoted by h(k) and k is the mean SI. Since the transmission chain of 2019-nCoV remains unclear, we adopted the SI information from SARS and MERS, which share the similar pathogen as 2019nCoV. We modelled h(k) as Gamma distributions with mean of 7.6 days and standard deviation (SD) of 3.4 days for MERS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], and mean of 8.4 days and SD of 3.8 days for SARS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] as well as their average, see the row heads in Table 1 for each scenario."
