            "The disease caused by the new coronavirus now has an official name: COVID-19.",
            "The disease, and the virus, had been going by a number of monikers, including 2019-nCoV, since they emerged in China in December. The World Health Organization (WHO), which announced the new name on 11 February, said that it chose one that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal or a group of people, to avoid stigma.",
            "On the same day, a group with the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for naming the pathogens, designated the virus itself SARS-CoV-2 (A. E. Gorbalenya et al Preprint on bioRxiv http://doi.org/dmsh; 2020). The group said that this term highlights the new virus\u2019s similarity to SARS-CoV, the coronavirus identified in 2003 that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome.",
            "But the virus name caused consternation, particularly among Chinese virologists, who worry that it will confuse the public and impede efforts to control the pathogen\u2019s spread. Although the two viruses belong to the same species, the new coronavirus spreads faster than SARS-CoV but is less deadly, says Shibo Jiang, a virologist at Fudan University in Shanghai. The new coronavirus has infected more than 73,000 people."

            "Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian environmentalist and former head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) who had been accused of sexual harassment, died on 13 February. He was 79 and his death followed recent heart surgery, according to media reports.",
            "From 2002 to 2015, Pachauri was chair of the IPCC \u2014 the international organization that produces scientific reports on the state of climate change and developed the Paris agreement to halt global warming. In 2007, during his tenure, the organization received the Nobel Peace Prize.",
            "Born in 1940 in Uttarakhand state, Pachauri studied engineering and economics in India and the United States. He became director of the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), a climate and energy-policy institute based in New Delhi, in 1981. He received several civilian honours from the Indian government.",
            "But in 2015, he stepped down as chief of the IPCC and from TERI\u2019s leadership after a female colleague accused him of sexual harassment. Pachauri denied the accusations; a case was pending in a Delhi court at the time of his death.",

            "NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft \u2014 which travelled to the farthest reaches of the Solar System \u2014 took this image in January 2019, when it flew past Arrokoth. The object, which was previously known as 2014 MU69, lies beyond Pluto in the frigid Kuiper belt, and is the most distant Solar System object imaged up close.",
            "Scientists with the mission published new findings on the rocky object in Science on 13 February. They show that Arrokoth\u2019s two lobes are not quite as flat as they appeared previously, and that they probably merged gently in the early days of the Solar System, at least four billion years ago. Arrokoth, which is 36 kilometres long, is extremely red, probably because cosmic rays have blasted its surface to create red organic molecules. Unlike many objects in the outer Solar System, Arrokoth has no water frozen on its surface, although it does have methanol ice (see go.nature.com/37evuex for more).",
            "It is probably typical of the Kuiper belt objects in similar orbits, says David Jewitt, an astronomer at the University of California, Los Angeles. But it would take another spacecraft visit to find out conclusively, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know for sure until we look.\u201d"

            "A government reshuffle last week ousted the UK minister for universities and science, Chris Skidmore.",
            "Skidmore had occupied the position \u2014 which has seen a revolving door of appointees and a series of resignations in recent years \u2014 for two periods since 2018, and was popular with academics.",
            "As Nature went to press, it was not clear who would take on the ministerial briefs for universities and science. But preliminary appointments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative government suggested that responsibility for the areas would be split between ministers for the first time since 2010.",
            "Alok Sharma (pictured) was appointed secretary of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which oversees science. The government also named Sharma president of COP26, the highprofile climate conference to be held in Glasgow in November, where nations will review their pledges to cut emissions.",
            "The reshuffle comes as the United Kingdom heads into negotiations over its future relationship with the European Union. Crucial for UK scientists will be whether they can take part in Horizon Europe, the EU\u2019s next major research-funding programme, following the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the bloc last month."
