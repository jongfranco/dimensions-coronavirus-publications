        "abstract": "Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2\u2019fluoro-2\u2019-C-methylguanosine-5\u2019-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC50 of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1\u20135, ranged from 5\u201328 nM. The active 5\u2019-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1\u20135 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O6-alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC50 values  25 \u03bcM against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.",

            "There are approximately 71 million people globally who are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). A significant number of those with chronic infection will develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or liver failure, resulting in approximately 400,000 deaths each year [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Recently approved combination regimens of DAAs, such as sofosbuvir (SOF) plus ledipasvir or velpatasvir and glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, have not only drastically improved efficacy outcomes, but have decreased treatment side effects compared to the interferon-containing regimens of the past [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Indeed, these regimens have produced sustained virologic response (SVR) rates greater than 90%, and with treatment duration of 8\u201312 weeks, depending on the regimen and patient population, have resulted in sustained virologic cures. Despite these recent advances, significant challenges remain in managing difficult-to-treat populations including those with HCV genotype (GT) 3 infection, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience. These populations typically require at least 12 weeks of treatment, often in combination with ribavirin, which increases the risk of serious side effects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], or they are not able to receive treatment regimens containing a protease inhibitor due to their advanced liver disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Therefore, an ideal regimen would have high efficacy based on shorter treatment duration for most, if not all, patient populations, with an improved safety profile that includes less drugdrug interaction potential compared to some currently approved regimens."

The salt form of AT-511, AT-527, was used in the animal studies because of its increased aqueous solubility, thus enhancing oral absorption.<br/><br/>In initial experiments, an HCV GT1b replicon system in stably transfected Huh-7 cells was used to evaluate the anti-HCV activity and the cytotoxicity of AT-511 using the Britelite and XTT reagents, respectively. SOF, which was used as a positive control, had a mean EC50 value of 48 \u00b1 10 nM (range 33 to 68 nM) and a mean EC95 value of 270 \u00b1 70 nM (range 197 to 387 nM). Six different blinded batches of AT-511 (n = 9 determinations) gave a mean EC50 value of 5 \u00b1 3 nM (range 0.8 to 12 nM) and a mean EC95 value of 25 \u00b1 13 nM (range 3 to 50 nM), demonstrating that AT-511 is roughly 10-fold more potent than SOF (Fig 3; S1 Table).

            "AT-511, the free base of the new drug candidate, AT-527, was significantly more potent in vitro against all HCV genotypes tested when compared to SOF, the only currently approved nucleoside NS5B inhibitor for treatment of HCV infections. Compared to SOF, AT-511 is 11\u2013 14 times more potent against the difficult-to-treat GT3. Moreover, AT-511 is 40\u201358 times and plasma concentrations of AT-511, AT-273, M1 and M4 were measured by LC-MS/MS. Data are mean \u00b1 SD for each group.<br/><br/>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0227104.g007 more potent than SOF against RAVs containing the S282T polymorphism and at least 10-fold more potent than PSI-938, suggesting that AT-511 may potentially demonstrate greater clinical antiviral activity than these other two nucleotide prodrugs. This result is consistent with the high intracellular formation of the active triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, in both Huh-7 cells and in human hepatocytes. The in vivo monkey and rat studies demonstrated that AT511 was efficiently absorbed when dosed orally as its hemi-sulfate salt, AT-527, and was extensively converted to its active TP in liver, the target of HCV infection. Despite the relatively low concentrations of AT-511 in rat plasma after oral administration of AT-527, an observation which is consistent with the known high levels of esterase activity in rodent blood [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], this species produces one of the highest amounts of the active TP in hepatocyte incubations in vitro as well as liver concentrations in vivo. Additionally, the rat and monkey studies showed that oral administration of a single dose of AT-527 resulted in preferential delivery of AT-9010 and its monophosphate precursors, M2 and M3 to the liver, and that the active TP was the predominant intracellular phosphorylated metabolite formed."

            "Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2\u2019fluoro-2\u2019-C-methylguanosine-5\u2019-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC50 of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1\u20135, ranged from 5\u201328 nM. The active 5\u2019-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1\u20135 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O6-alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC50 values  25 \u03bcM against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.",

Despite these recent advances, significant challenges remain in managing difficult-to-treat populations including those with HCV genotype (GT) 3 infection, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience. These populations typically require at least 12 weeks of treatment, often in combination with ribavirin, which increases the risk of serious side effects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], or they are not able to receive treatment regimens containing a protease inhibitor due to their advanced liver disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Therefore, an ideal regimen would have high efficacy based on shorter treatment duration for most, if not all, patient populations, with an improved safety profile that includes less drugdrug interaction potential compared to some currently approved regimens.",
            "For the treatment of HCV, DAAs have been developed that target different critical steps in the HCV life cycle. One such target of interest is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), encoded by the NS5B region of the HCV genome, which is essential for viral replication. Thus, nucleotide analogs that can be converted to their triphosphate analog within cells, incorporated into nascent HCV RNA, and block viral replication are preferred candidates since they have proven to be potent, pan-genotypic inhibitors with a high barrier to drug resistance. In addition, the apparent improved antiviral activity of guanosine analogs, compared to pyrimidine analogs such as SOF [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], had prompted a search for modified guanosine analogs containing a proven substituted ribose moiety with a monophosphate prodrug. Previously identified guanosine analogs such as PSI-938 (a cyclic phosphate prodrug of 2\u2019-fluoro-2\u2019-Cmethylguanosine-5\u2019-monophosphate) and BMS-986094 (a prodrug of 2\u2019-C-methylguanosine5\u2019-monophosphate) had excellent activity against HCV replication, but their development was halted due to observed hepatic and cardiac toxicity, respectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. The structures of AT527, SOF, PSI-938 and BMS-986094 as well as PSI-661, a structurally-related HCV inhibitor that showed potent in vitro activity against HCV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], are presented in Fig 1.",
            "We are presently developing AT-527, whose putative metabolic pathway is presented in Fig 2. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a phosphoramidate prodrug of 2\u2019-fluoro-2\u2019-Cmethylguanosine-5\u2019-monophosphate. The phosphoramidate moiety of AT-527 is identical to that of SOF [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and is presumed to be subject to the same initial metabolic activation pathway leading to the unique nucleotide monophosphate (MP) still containing the N6-methyl modification (M2), that is, hydrolysis catalyzed by human cathepsin A (CatA) and/or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) producing the L-alanyl intermediate (M1), followed by removal of the amino acid moiety by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) resulting in the MP metabolite, M2. As with PSI-938, M2 is likely converted to M3 by adenosine deaminase like protein 1 (ADALP1; [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]) and further anabolized sequentially by guanylate kinase 1 (GUK1) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) to the pharmacologically active triphosphate (TP), AT9010. Presumably, both M2 and M3 can be dephosphorylated by 5\u2019-nucleotidase (5\u2019-NTase) to their respective nucleosides M4 and AT-273 (Fig 2). Thus, AT-527 possesses a unique structural feature with an N6-methyl group which critically differentiates it from other guanosine nucleotide analogs with respect to drug metabolism and provides the compound with a",

The salt form of AT-511, AT-527, was used in the animal studies because of its increased aqueous solubility, thus enhancing oral absorption.",
            "In initial experiments, an HCV GT1b replicon system in stably transfected Huh-7 cells was used to evaluate the anti-HCV activity and the cytotoxicity of AT-511 using the Britelite and XTT reagents, respectively. SOF, which was used as a positive control, had a mean EC50 value of 48 \u00b1 10 nM (range 33 to 68 nM) and a mean EC95 value of 270 \u00b1 70 nM (range 197 to 387 nM). Six different blinded batches of AT-511 (n = 9 determinations) gave a mean EC50 value of 5 \u00b1 3 nM (range 0.8 to 12 nM) and a mean EC95 value of 25 \u00b1 13 nM (range 3 to 50 nM), demonstrating that AT-511 is roughly 10-fold more potent than SOF (Fig 3; S1 Table). Neither AT-511 nor SOF showed toxicity to the replicon cells up to the highest concentrations tested (100 \u03bcM for AT-511; 1 \u03bcM for SOF).",
            "The antiviral activities of AT-511 and SOF were also determined using Huh-7 replicon cells stably-transfected with the NS5B region of HCV GT1b (HCV genotype 1b, Con-1) in the PhenoSense HCV NS5B assay. Concentrations of SOF needed to achieve EC50 and EC95 levels in this laboratory strain (89 and 545 nM, respectively) were up to 9 times greater than those for AT-511 (13 and 61 nM, respectively) (Table 1). An additional five Huh-7 cell lines containing the NS5B regions of various HCV genotypes were tested with AT-511 and SOF (Table 1). Similar to the reference virus, the EC50 value was, on average, 9-fold higher for SOF (11-fold higher for EC95) as compared to AT-511, with potency ratios ranging from 5.5 to 11.4 for the different strains. Additionally, the range in EC50 values for SOF (51\u2013287 nM) was 5.6-fold across the genotypes tested, compared with a tighter 3.1-fold range (9\u201329 nM) for AT-511.",
            "In addition, EC50 values across eight different Huh-7 replicons transiently-transfected with the NS5B regions of HCV derived from clinical isolates of various genotypes were, on average, 8-fold higher for SOF than AT-511, with potency ratios ranging from 4 to 12 (Table 2). The range in SOF EC50 values (23\u2013126 nM) was 5.5-fold, whereas that for AT-511 covered only a 2.3-fold range (6\u201314 nM). The EC95 potency ratios (4 to 14) and variabilities (195\u20131020 nM and 5.2-fold for SOF; 33\u201380 nM and 2.5-fold for AT-511) were similar across the patientderived genotypes as well (Table 2).

This data reflects the rapid absorption and efficient conversion of AT-511 to M1, suggesting that elimination of the nucleoside metabolites M4 and AT-273 (likely via renal excretion) was not saturated as the dose was increased. Again, AT-273 had the longest MRT after administration of AT-527 at all three dose levels (Table 8), indicative of the long half-life of the active TP formed intracellularly.",

Similarly, mean liver/heart concentration ratios for AT-9010 in male monkeys 4 hr after an oral dose of AT-527 at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg (n = 2 per dose) were 11\u201331 (Table 9), indicating preferential formation of the active TP in the liver of both species. In fact, in all heart tissues except one from a rat dosed at 500 mg/kg, concentrations of AT-9010 had to be estimated by extrapolation of the calibration curves below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the LC-MS/MS assay (110 pmol/g). Moreover, as was observed in hepatocytes and Huh-7 cells, the active TP was the predominant metabolite measured in 4-h monkey livers at 30 and 100 mg/kg and its concentrations were dose proportional (545 \u00b1 349 and 1890 \u00b1 519",

At the lower more therapeutically relevant dose of 30 mg/kg, the mean liver AT-9010 concentration was 34-fold higher than its parent phosphoramidate, again demonstrating efficient conversion of AT-511 to the active TP in liver cells. Monkey livers had 500-fold more AT-511 after the 300 mg/kg dose compared to the 30 mg/kg dose, suggesting that conversion to M1 via esterase activity becomes saturated at a very high dose. Nevertheless, even at this high dose, AT-9010 concentrations were 18 times higher in liver compared to corresponding heart tissues. In addition to the high liver/heart ratios for AT9010 in monkeys, the similarly high ratios for its monophosphate precursors, M2 and M3 (11\u2013 72), are further evidence that these compounds are preferentially delivered to the liver, the target organ for HCV infection. As was observed in hepatocytes from all species tested, the 5\u2019-TP of M2 was either not detected in monkey liver and heart tissue or possibly present but only at trace levels, well below the LLOQ of the assay (110 pmol/g).",
            "The dose proportionality of AT-9010 in monkey livers between the 30 and 100 mg/kg doses was reflected in plasma levels of AT-273, with fold increases in respective Cmax and AUC0-last values of 3.1 and 1.9 with the 3.3-fold increase in dose. This is consistent with AT-273 only being formed via dephosphorylation of its phosphorylated forms (Fig 2). Since AT-9010 is the predominant intracellular phosphorylated metabolite, AT-273 can be considered a plasma marker of intracellular levels of the active triphosphate."

Despite the relatively low concentrations of AT-511 in rat plasma after oral administration of AT-527, an observation which is consistent with the known high levels of esterase activity in rodent blood [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], this species produces one of the highest amounts of the active TP in hepatocyte incubations in vitro as well as liver concentrations in vivo. Additionally, the rat and monkey studies showed that oral administration of a single dose of AT-527 resulted in preferential delivery of AT-9010 and its monophosphate precursors, M2 and M3 to the liver, and that the active TP was the predominant intracellular phosphorylated metabolite formed.",

            "The potent antiviral activity of AT-511 appears to be relatively specific to HCV, since the drug showed only weak or no measurable activity against a panel of other viruses. The lack of activity against the DNA viruses (HSV-1, adenovirus and HBV) and HIV-1 (which contains an RNA genome that requires reverse transcription into DNA) may be attributed to the dissimilarity in the polymerases involved in the replication of these viruses compared to that of HCV (a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus). The apparent specificity of AT-511 against the other single-stranded RNA viruses tested, however, suggests that there are differences in the polymerases of these related viruses that render them relatively resistant to inhibition by AT-9010. Nevertheless, the potency of AT-511 across all HCV genotypes tested speaks to the highly conserved nature of the HCV NS5B genomic region.",
            "Since certain N6- and O6-alkylated purines are substrates for ADALP1 only when an unsubstituted 5\u2019-MP group is present [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], it is unlikely that the N6-methyl moiety of either M1 or M4 can be converted directly to their corresponding guanosine analog. Similarly, AT-273 can likely only be formed via dephosphorylation of its mono-, di- and tri-phosphorylated forms. The active TP is formed and retained intracellularly and its levels cannot be directly measured in blood samples. However, as AT-9010 is the most abundant metabolite formed in Huh-7 cells and hepatocytes in vitro and in liver tissue in vivo, plasma levels of AT-273 can be regarded as a surrogate of the intracellular levels of the active TP. Thus, the 10 h half-life of AT-9010 observed in human hepatocytes in vitro as well as the prolonged MRT of AT-273 in plasma of rats and monkeys after administration of a single oral dose of AT-527 are consistent with once daily oral dosing for treatment of HCV infections.",
            "Arnold and colleagues [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] have reported that all antiviral ribonucleoside TP analogs tested, including SOF TP, were incorporated by POLRMT to some extent. Whereas mitochondrial toxicity has not been reported for SOF, the rapid development of cardiac toxicity observed in clinical trials with BMS-986094 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] has been attributed to the ability of its active TP to inhibit POLRMT at concentrations 25- to 50-fold lower than those required of the TPs of AT-511 and SOF, as was demonstrated herein and previously reported for BMS-986094 and SOF [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Undoubtedly, the 2\u2019-\u03b1-fluoro substitution in AT-511 and SOF that replaces the more naturally occurring 2\u2019-\u03b1-hydroxy group in BMS-986094 is the reason for the far lower substrate efficiencies of the TPs of AT-511 and SOF for POLRMT compared to that of the TP of BMS-986094.",
            "To assess the potential for AT-511 to cause mitochondrial toxicity, multiple in vitro tests were conducted. The glucose-galactose cytotoxicity assay in K562 cells did not detect any changes in mitochondrial function. Although this assay has been widely used to detect mitochondrial toxicity, several investigators have found it to be of limited value as some known mitochondrial toxins such as ddC did not generate cytotoxicity in galactose-adapted cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. However, the lack of toxicity observed with AT-511 in the mitobiogenesis assay conducted in PC3 cells is reassuring as these cells are sensitive to mitochondrial toxicity and the mitochondrial protein synthesis assay is well-accepted for evaluating nucleoside analogs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Moreover, AT-511 was not cytotoxic to iPS cardiomyocytes or bone marrow progenitor cells, indicating that this drug will not have the cardiotoxicity or myelosuppressive effects observed with other nucleoside analogs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].",

The results of the rhCYP3A4 study highlight this difference since, unlike PSI661 and PSI-938, no mutagenic O6-alkylguanine bases were formed from AT-511, and only 1.8% was converted to other modified nucleobases, thus mitigating the hepatotoxicity risk from AT-527. Moreover, with almost no inhibitory effect on a panel of cytochrome P450 enzymes, AT-527 appears to have a low potential for metabolic drug-drug interactions.",
            "With potent pan-genotypic antiviral activity and a favorable preclinical safety profile compared to other highly inhibitory protides of GTP analogs, AT-527 has the potential to be a more effective component of HCV therapies by achieving high SVR rates in all patient populations regardless of genotype and stage of disease with possibly shortened treatment duration.

This result is consistent with the high intracellular formation of the active triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, in both Huh-7 cells and in human hepatocytes",
