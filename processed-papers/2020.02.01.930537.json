        "abstract": "The outbreaks of 2002/2003 SARS, 2012/2015 MERS and 2019/2020 Wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus (CoV) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability, and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.",

In November 2002, SARS emerged in southern China and then was spreading across the world in 2003, resulting in ~8,000 cases with a fatality rate of about 10%(WHO, 2004). Ten years later, MERS emerged in Saudi Arabia and spread to different countries with a fatality rate of about 35%(WHO, 2016). Both viruses are of zoonotic nature: SARS-CoV originates from bats/civet cats(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGe_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rGe_et+al_2013_a\">Ge et al, 2013</a>), and the major reservoir for MERS-CoV is dromedary camels(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cReusken_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rReusken_et+al_2016_a\">Reusken et al, 2016</a>).

            "We have performed large-scale protein-protein docking to evaluate the binding affinities of SARSCoV and 2019-nCoV S-RBDs to the human receptor ACE2, in order to quantitatively assess the human receptor-binding capability of 2019-nCoV. Using the well-investigated SARS-CoV as the reference, our results showed that 2019-nCoV reaches about 73% of the ACE2 receptor-binding strength of SARS-CoV. This supports that the 2019-nCoV S-protein encoded by its genome has processed human receptor-binding ability close to that of SARS-CoV, and thus this newly emerged virus is likely able to bind to ACE2 and then to drive human-to-human transmission. However, the docking sampling for a large number of thermodynamically probable conformations did not find any binding conformation with an energy score lower than that of the lowest-energy conformation of SARS-CoV derived from experimentally determined structure, offering molecular evidence that the receptor-binding ability of 2019-nCoV is less than that of SARS-CoV.<br/><br/>Of course, ultimate confirmation of computational predictions requires experimental verification, which will also be very important for improving our method in the future. However, experimental approaches for deeply understanding the human transmission of viruses in terms of receptor-binding interactions and specificity is rather time consuming. Sometimes, it might be even impossible to employ experimental methods to thoroughly examine every evolved, mutant strain of a newly emerged virus, such as 2019-nCoV in our case. As an alternative, using a high-performance computer, our approach may assess the receptor-binding capability of a newly identified strain within a very short period of time. Thus, our method can be useful for the post-genome analysis for a newly identified CoV and its mutant strains, with the first-determined genome data. Note that, although viral genome data provide useful sequence information for comparison-based assessments with previously identified viruses, these data themselves do not offer hints about how the encoded viral proteins carry out their functions which may lead to serious human infections and diseases. Hence, post-genome analysis of viral protein functions is valuable not only for understanding the viruses themselves, but also for offering useful scientific supports for making effective, early decisions about viral prevention and control."

And, it is evident that human-to-human transmission is causing the rapid spreading of this newly emerged virus. Viral strains from infected persons of the area have been sequenced; but only little genetic variation was found, implying that they are descended from a common ancestor(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRambaut_2020_a\" href=\"#rRambaut_2020_a\">Rambaut, 2020</a>). Full-length genome analysis of 2019-nCoV patient samples revealed 79.5% and 96% sequence identities to SARSCoV and a bat SARSr-Cov (severe acute respiratory syndrome-related CoV), respectively; however, sequences of the seven conserved viral replicase domains in ORF1ab show 94.6% identity between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2020_a\">Zhou et al, 2020</a></a>).",
            "It is widely accepted that the CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its trimeric transmembrane spike glycoprotein (S-protein) with the human receptors on the host cell surface. The S-protein consists of two subunits (i.e., S1 and S2) and is essential for the early steps of host cell infection: S-protein of a virion binds to the host cell receptors via its S1 receptor-binding domain (SRBD) and then fuses the viral membrane with cellular membranes. The host cell receptors differ among human CoVs: SARS-CoV binds to exopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2005_a\">Li et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2003_a\">Li et al, 2003</a>), and MERS-CoV to dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DPP4)(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRaj_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rRaj_et+al_2013_a\">Raj et al, 2013</a>); other CoVs such as HCoV-HKU1 use O-acetylated sialic acid as a receptor(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2015_a\">Huang et al, 2015</a>).",

To this end, large-scale local protein-protein docking was first carried out to sample a large number of thermodynamically probable conformations for the S-RBD binding to ACE2. Next, the binding free energy of S-RBD to ACE2 was calculated according to the thermodynamic average over the sampled, low-energy binding conformations. Our results show that the human receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, implying that 2019-nCoV is able to bind to ACE2, and thereby infects the human host cells like SARS-CoV."

Then, more than 3,000 independent docking runs were conducted to sample the low-energy binding conformations by optimizing rigidbody orientation and side-chain conformations, according to the docking protocols in Methods. The binding free-energy scores of the obtained complex models are shown in the scatter plot in Fig. 1A, against their RMSD (root mean square deviation) values of interface residues with respect to those in the starting co-crystal structure.",
            "As seen, a deep energetic funnel exhibits in the plot, and therefore clearly indicates that the docking simulations are very successful, because the presence of such a funnel is the most robust measure of successful docking simulations(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChaudhury_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rChaudhury_et+al_2011_a\">Chaudhury et al, 2011</a>). Due to their locations at the funnel bottom, the top-scoring models have better binding free-energy scores than other low-energy models, and therefore are considered to be the most probable, native-like binding conformations in thermodynamics. Significantly, the number of the native-like models among the top five scores (N5) is 5; also, their interface RMSDs are within 1.5 \u00c5. Therefore, the lowest-energy conformations identified by the docking approach are almost identical to the experimental structure (PDB 2AJF). This provides a very solid basis for using this approach to investigate the S-RBD-ACE2 interactions of 2019-nCoV, in which no experimental complex structure is available because of time limitation, but only the firstdetermined genome data that can be used to predict the 2019-nCoV S-RBD structure.",
            "The successful identification of the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy binding conformations also validates the accuracy of the used Rosetta all-atom energy function(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAlford_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rAlford_et+al_2017_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAlford_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rAlford_et+al_2017_a\">Alford et al, 2017</a></a>) for quantifying the interactions of S-RBD with ACE2. As we will show, we could use the thermodynamic average of the binding energy scores of these conformations as an experiment-based energy reference to characterize the interactions of the 2019-nCoV S-RBD binding to ACE2, and then to evaluate the relative strength with respect to that of SARS-CoV. Such a comparison assessment avoids using the calculated, absolute free-energy scores to correlate with the binding strength, which might systematically differ from the actual measurement values because of the intrinsic, theoretical approximations of the used Rosetta all-atom energy function(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAlford_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rAlford_et+al_2017_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAlford_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rAlford_et+al_2017_a\">Alford et al, 2017</a></a>). We want to point out that all the docking simulations for SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV use the same protocols and a consistent all-atom energy function. So, even the calculated energy scores contain certain errors caused by theoretical approximations, determination of the relative binding strength by comparing the calculated energy scores of two viruses should be fairly accurate.",
            "High-resolution prediction of 2019-nCoV S-RBD structure Because the 2019-nCoVgenome has just been sequenced for a very short period of time, an experimental 3D structure for performing protein-protein docking of 2019-nCoV S-RBD to ACE2 is not yet available. Alternatively, computational methods may be used to predict the 3D structure(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSchwede_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rSchwede_et+al_2009_a\">Schwede et al, 2009</a>). Fortunately, the 2019-nCoV genome has shown that the amino-acid sequence of the S-protein is about 75% identical to that of the SARS-CoV S-protein (Fig. 2A). Therefore, with the SARS-CoV S-RBD structure as a template, it is possible to use high-resolution homology modeling method to accurately predict the 3D model(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cQian_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rQian_et+al_2007_a\">Qian et al, 2007</a>).",

Then, we performed all-atom refinements to optimize this initial model with Rosetta protocols (see Methods). The top-1 scoring model was used as the 3D structure of the 2019nCoV S-RBD for the protein-protein docking with the experimental structure of ACE2 from PDB",
            "When comparing with the SARS-CoV results in Fig. 1A, we found that there is no binding conformation with a binding energy score less than that of the lowest-energy conformation of SARSCoV derived from experimentally determined structure (i.e., -37.4 kcal\u00b7mol-1 in Fig. 1A). To be sure, we also carried out high-resolution all-atom refinements to further optimize the lowest-energy binding conformation by 200 independent runs (see Methods). As indicated the scatter plot in Fig. 4A, the lowest-energy value of the 200 refined models remains about -28.4 kcal\u00b7mol-1 (Fig. 4B). Considering that the protein-protein docking has already sampled a large number of thermodynamically probable, low-energy binding conformations, these results indicate that the existence of an ACE2-binding conformation for 2019-nCoV S-RBD with an energy value < -37.4 kcal\u00b7mol-1 is very limited. So, the binding strength of 2019-nCoV S-RBD to ACE2 is unlikely greater than that of SARS-CoV S-RBD.",
            "Comparison of human receptor-binding capability of 2019-nCoV with SARS-CoV The successful identifications of the native-like binding conformations of S-RBDs to ACE2 enable a comparison of the receptor-binding capability of 2019-nCoV with that of SARS-CoV. Especially, the obtained energy scores based on the experimentally determined structure of SARS-CoV defined a binding free-energy scale, on which the relative receptor-binding strength of a newly emerged CoV could be evaluated.",

            "where N is the total number of the low-energy conformations sampled in the docking simulations, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature (i.e., 298.15 K for the room temperature).",

            "and that of 2019-nCoV S-RBD to ACE2 is:",
            "By comparing these two values, we found that 2019-nCoV S-RBD reaches about 73% of the binding strength of SARS-CoV S-RBD to ACE2. Since the receptor-binding of S-protein is the major driving force for the viral transmission to the human host cells, such a strength order supports that 2019-nCoV is able to infect the human host cells like SARS-CoV(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2020_a\">Zhou et al, 2020</a>).",
            "Soon after the 2019-nCoV genome sequencing, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cXu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rXu_et+al_2020_a\">Xu et al (2020</a>) also used structural modeling approach to predict the binding affinity of S-RBD to ACE2 In their study, two single complex conformations (i.e., one crystal structure and one predicted structure) were employed to calculate the binding free-energies of two CoVs, and showed that the affinity of 2019-nCoV S-RBD to ACE2 was in the order of ~65% of that for SARS-CoV. So, their predicted strength is about 10% lower than our value. Certainly, although our binding free-energy scores were calculated using a large-number of thermodynamically probable, low-energy binding conformations, further experimental measurements will be needed to testify the accuracy of both methods."

        "Conclusions": [
            "We have performed large-scale protein-protein docking to evaluate the binding affinities of SARSCoV and 2019-nCoV S-RBDs to the human receptor ACE2, in order to quantitatively assess the human receptor-binding capability of 2019-nCoV. Using the well-investigated SARS-CoV as the reference, our results showed that 2019-nCoV reaches about 73% of the ACE2 receptor-binding strength of SARS-CoV. This supports that the 2019-nCoV S-protein encoded by its genome has processed human receptor-binding ability close to that of SARS-CoV, and thus this newly emerged virus is likely able to bind to ACE2 and then to drive human-to-human transmission. However, the docking sampling for a large number of thermodynamically probable conformations did not find any binding conformation with an energy score lower than that of the lowest-energy conformation of SARS-CoV derived from experimentally determined structure, offering molecular evidence that the receptor-binding ability of 2019-nCoV is less than that of SARS-CoV.",
            "Of course, ultimate confirmation of computational predictions requires experimental verification, which will also be very important for improving our method in the future. However, experimental approaches for deeply understanding the human transmission of viruses in terms of receptor-binding interactions and specificity is rather time consuming. Sometimes, it might be even impossible to employ experimental methods to thoroughly examine every evolved, mutant strain of a newly emerged virus, such as 2019-nCoV in our case. As an alternative, using a high-performance computer, our approach may assess the receptor-binding capability of a newly identified strain within a very short period of time. Thus, our method can be useful for the post-genome analysis for a newly identified CoV and its mutant strains, with the first-determined genome data. Note that, although viral genome data provide useful sequence information for comparison-based assessments with previously identified viruses, these data themselves do not offer hints about how the encoded viral proteins carry out their functions which may lead to serious human infections and diseases. Hence, post-genome analysis of viral protein functions is valuable not only for understanding the viruses themselves, but also for offering useful scientific supports for making effective, early decisions about viral prevention and control.",
            "In summary, this study presents a fast method for accurately assessing the human transmission capability of newly emerged CoVs, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of CoV proteinprotein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for the viral prevention and control."

            "To validate the docking approach, the authors first carried out local protein-protein docking to investigate the binding interactions of SARS-CoV S-RBD with ACE2, in order to test whether this approach could identify the lowest-energy conformations of S-RBD complexed with ACE2 identical or close to the experimental structure(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2005_a\">Li et al, 2005</a>)",
            "The latter is considered to be the most probable, native-like binding conformation in reality.",
            "The binding free-energy scores of the obtained complex models are shown in the scatter plot in Fig. 1A, against their RMSD values of interface residues with respect to those in the starting co-crystal structure"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "The authors have performed large-scale protein-protein docking to evaluate the binding affinities of SARSCoV and 2019-nCoV S-RBDs to the human receptor ACE2, in order to quantitatively assess the human receptor-binding capability of 2019-nCoV.",
            "Using the well-investigated SARS-CoV as the reference, the results showed that 2019-nCoV reaches about 73% of the ACE2 receptor-binding strength of SARS-CoV.",
            "This supports that the 2019-nCoV S-protein encoded by its genome has processed human receptor-binding ability close to that of SARS-CoV, and this newly emerged virus is likely able to bind to ACE2 and to drive human-to-human transmission.",
            "Post-genome analysis of viral protein functions is valuable not only for understanding the viruses themselves, but for offering useful scientific supports for making effective, early decisions about viral prevention and control"
