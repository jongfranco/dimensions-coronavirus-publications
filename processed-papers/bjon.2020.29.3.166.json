For example, travel between most places in the world takes less time than the incubation period for many infectious diseases (Wilson, 2003). From an infectious disease perspective, globalisation has resulted in a world without borders where control of infections necessitates international cooperation and coordination. Currently we are experiencing this first-hand with the outbreak of a new coronavirus in the city of Wuhan in China, resulting in immense concern regarding a severe global public health threat.",

Lu et al (2020) advise that this is a fish and wild animal market that also sold live animals such as poultry, bats, marmots, and snakes. Public Health England (PHE) referred to the new virus as Wuhan novel coronavirus (WNCoV) ahead of an internationally accepted term; however,WHO now recommends that the interim name of the disease in the current outbreak should be \u20182019-nCoV acute respiratory disease\u2019 (the \u2018n\u2019 is for novel and \u2018CoV\u2019 is for coronavirus).This name complies with the WHO (2015) best practices for naming of new human infectious diseases.
