        "abstract": "The outbreak of 2019-nCoV in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019 poses unprecedent public health challenges to both China and the rest world[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified bat coronavirus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. The newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a continuous threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.",

RNA from 17 of the 25 Malayan pangolins generated the expected PCR product, while RNA from the Chinese pangolins failed to amplify. In the analysis of plasma samples from eight of the Malayan pangolins using a double-antigen sandwich ELISA designed for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against with 2019-nCoV, one sample reacted strongly with an OD450 value of 2.12 (cutoff value: 0.11). The plasma remained positive at the dilution of 1:80, suggesting that the pangolin was naturally infected a 2019-nCoV-like virus. Comparing with one \u03b2 CoV-negative pangolin, histopathological examinations of tissues from four \u03b2 CoV-positive pangolins revealed the occurrence of interstitial pneumonia in the lung and severe congestion and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver, kidney, lymph node, and other organs. Minor hemorrhage was seen in alveolar ducts of the lung and epithelial surface of the bladder (Fig 1 and Fig S1)."
