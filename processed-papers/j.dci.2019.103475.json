        "journal": "Developmental & Comparative Immunology",
        "volume": "102",
        "abstract": "In mammals, interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) can be activated by tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Upon activation, IRF5 translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to IFN promoter and up-regulates IFN expression. However, there are few reports on the molecular mechanism by which TRAF6 up-regulates IFN expression in fish. In this study, we explored how Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) TRAF6 initiated innate immunity by activating IRF5. We found that CiTRAF6, CiIRF5 and CiIFN1 were all significantly up-regulated in LPS-stimulated CIK cells and the expression of CiTRAF6 was earlier than the expressions of CiIRF5 and CiIFN1. These findings suggested that CiIFN1 expression might be induced by CiTRAF6 in fish. CiIFN1 expression, CiIFN1 promoter activity and CO cells viability were all significantly up-regulated in the overexpression experiments, but they were significantly down-regulated in the gene silencing experiments. This indicated that CiTRAF6, along with CiIRF5, regulated CiIFN1 expression. The localization analysis found that both CiTRAF6 and CiIRF5 located in the cytoplasm. Following LPS stimulation, CiIRF5 was observed to translocate to the nucleus. GST-pull down and co-IP experiments revealed that CiTRAF6 interacted with CiIRF5. The colocalization analysis also showed that CiTRAF6 bound with CiIRF5 in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of CiTRAF6 increased the endogenous CiIRF5, promoted its ubiquitination and nuclear translocation. In conclusion, CiTRAF6 bound to CiIRF5 in the cytoplasm, and then activated CiIRF5, resulting in up-regulating the expression of CiIFN1.",
