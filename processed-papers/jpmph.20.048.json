With the arrival of Chinese tourists and the domestic travel in conjunction with Chinese New Year's Day and Korean New Year's Day holidays, 24 cases were confirmed in Korea on February 8, 2020. As Jeju Island is a popular tourist destination, the risk of influx of COVID-19 and community spread is higher than any other region in Korea.",

Chinese authorities reported on January 26 that COVID-19 is infectious during the incubation period [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. In addition, a news story from January 28 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] and a research paper published on January 30 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] reported that a confirmed patient in Germany had contact with an asymptomatic woman from China two days before the onset of symptoms.
