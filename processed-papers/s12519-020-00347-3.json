Owing to rigorous quarantine and control measures taken in China, routine neonatal health surveillance and follow-up have become challenging. Without follow-up surveillance, some rapid and progressive newborn diseases, such as bilirubin encephalopathy, may be ignored. The characteristics of onset age of kernicterus suggest that monitoring of bilirubin level at home provides a useful way to alert hospital visits and to prevent the development of extremely hyperbilirubinemia. Therefore, we developed an online follow-up program for convenient monitoring of bilirubin level of newborns that is based on our practical experiences. The aim is to make our management strategies of neonatal jaundice tailored to the infection prevention and control during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

        "Risk factor screening for severe hyperbilirubinemia": [
            "Risk factors of severe hyperbilirubinemia include preterm birth, perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, isoimmune hemolysis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency, cephalohematoma, significant skin bruising, hypoalbuminemia, jaundice observed in the first 24 hours, and exclusive breastfeeding with excessive weight loss [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
            "Maternal medical history and birth history should be reviewed in detail. Every newborn infant should be examined comprehensively. According to the history, physical examination and risk factors, necessary diagnostic investigations, and laboratory tests (total serum bilirubin, count of blood cell, hematocrit, liver function, blood type, Coomb\u2019s test, G-6-PD screening, head ultrasound, etc.) were chosen to explore the underlying conditions."
        ],
        "Early establishment of breastfeeding": [
            "For infants without contraindications of enteral feeding, breastfeeding should be started at 20\u201330 min after birth. Infant\u2019s weight is measured every 1\u20132 days. Breastfed infants usually reach the maximum weight loss by day 3 of age, and most lose weight less than 10% of their birth weight. If the weight loss is more than 10%, the adequacy of milk intake should be evaluated. Other evidence of adequate intake includes 4\u20136 thoroughly wet diapers in 24 h and the passage of 3\u20134 stools per day by the fourth day [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Medical staff should evaluate mother\u2019s lactation skills every day and identify the risks of inadequate breast milk intake promptly."
        ],
        "Monitoring and management of hyperbilirubinemia before discharge": [
            "Jaundice is usually seen first in the face of the infant, and then progresses to the trunk and extremities. Since the visual estimation of the degree of jaundice is not reliable, we recommend transcutaneous bilirubin (TCB) measurement as the first choice. The interval between two measurements is 12\u201324 h. The results should be recorded in the chart. TCB is correlated with total serum bilirubin (TSB) decreasing as serum bilirubin concentration higher than 255 \u03bcmol/L (15 mg/dL), so TSB should be checked to confirm when TCB > 255 \u03bcmol/L.",
            "During the first days after birth, the bilirubin level is changing dynamically, so we use the hour-specific nomogram developed by Bhutani to predict the subsequent severe hyperbilirubinemia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. The bilirubin level below the 40th percentile is labeled as a low-risk zone and that above the 95th is labeled as a high-risk zone. Bilirubin levels between 40 to 75th and 75th to 95th percentile are low\u2013intermediate-risk zone and high\u2013intermediate-risk zone, respectively.",
            "The management plan is developed based on the risk zones as follows: 1. TCB level < 75th percentile (low-risk or low\u2013intermediate-risk zone): the risk of subsequent significant hyperbilirubinemia is low; infants just need routine care and repeated TCB in 24 hours.",
            "2. TCB level between 75 and 95th percentile (high\u2013intermediate-risk zone) without any risk factors: the risk of subsequent significant hyperbilirubinemia is still low; infants just need routine care and repeat TCB in 24 hours.",
            "3. TCB level between 75 and 95th percentile (high\u2013intermediate-risk zone) with at least one of the risk factors: the risk of subsequent significant hyperbilirubinemia is high; infants need aggressive breast feeding, ensure adequate intake and reduce the enterohepatic circulation. TCB should be repeated in 12 hours. Evaluate the causes of jaundice.",
            "4. TCB level > 95th percentile (high-risk zone): the risk of subsequent significant hyperbilirubinemia is very high; TSB should be checked. Infants need prompt intervention, start phototherapy, or exchange transfusion if the criteria met. Monitor the bilirubin level closely and evaluate the causes of jaundice."
        ],
        "Parenting education": [
            "With the rapid development of internet technology, smartphone application software (APP) has been used successfully in the monitoring for transcutaneous bilirubin level of newborn infants [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. We use online training instead of the classroom teaching during the epidemic. Parents can access the resources including education videos and training brochures on social media. Every parent should be fully informed of the potential harm of hyperbilirubinemia, the importance of bilirubin monitoring, the availability of online resources, and methods for assessing a newborn infant\u2019s condition. In addition, detailed information about COVID-19 and prevention strategies should be provided."
        ],
        "Indications of discharge": [
            "Healthy newborn infants with gestational age at 35 or more weeks are usually discharged on days 2 or 3 if the vital signs are stable, if feeding is good and daily weight loss is less than 3% of birth weight, and if the value of TCB on the day of discharge is below the 75th percentile. For the newborn infants admitted to the special care nursery or neonatal intensive-care unit, the indications of discharge include the following: (1) the underlying disease is cured or significantly improved; (2) the vital signs are stable; (3) infants who had been treated with phototherapy and/or exchange transfusion should be observed for at least 24 to 48 hours to make sure of no obvious rebound of bilirubin; (4) the TCB value on the day of discharge is below the 75th percentile.",
            "The follow-up plan is made based on the gestational age of infants, days after birth, and the bilirubin level on discharge day. The time schedule of the first online follow-up is listed in Table 1. Parents should be advised to use the APP software for remote follow-up and online consultation. Doctors will give the color calibration card for transcutaneous bilirubin measurement to parents. The remote follow-up route is mainly through Internet hospitals or other qualified Internet platforms. Under the guidance of healthcare workers, parents can make an appointment in Internet hospital before infants discharged home."
        ],
        "General condition evaluation": [
            "The parents shall fill in the questionnaire on the APP software, including the general conditions of the infant, feeding issues, weight changes, abnormal clinical symptoms, etc. (Table 2).",
