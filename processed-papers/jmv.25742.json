We extracted the data on 14 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinhua Municipal Central hospital through January 27th, 2020. We found that compared to pharyngeal swab specimens, nucleic acid detection of COVID-19 in fecal specimens was equally accurate. And we found that patients with a positive stool test did not experience gastrointestinal symptoms and had nothing to do with the severity of the lung infection. These results may help to understand the clinical diagnosis and the changes of clinical parameters of COVID-19.",

            "Since February 4th, we have collected patient samples intensively as the supply of PCR kits has increased. It was found that 5 of the 14 confirmed patients (35.7%) had a positive stool sample COVID-19 nucleic acid, and patients with positive stool samples were also positive for oropharyngeal swabs specimens at least the day before (Figure 1); The same trend is that patients with negative stool samples are also negative for oropharyngeal swabs for at least the first two days(Figure 1). This may indicate that the accuracy of fecal specimen detection and oropharyngeal swabs is the same.",
            "All 14 patients had computed tomography on admission, 92.8% manifested as pneumonia. 1 patient (Patient 3) chest computed tomography images did not demonstrate any consolidation or scarring (Figure 2),however, this patient was positive for multiple stool and oropharyngeal swabs specimens (Figure 1). Among the remaining 13 patients, ground glass opacity was observed in both lungs. 2 patients(Patient 6 and Patient 14) severely yielded more prominent abnormalities on chest computed tomography than non-severe cases (Figure 3), the nucleic acid test was negative for stool samples in these two patients, this indicates that fecal specimens are not related to nucleic acid positivity and severity. As of February 9, 2020, 3 patients recovered, but 11 were still being treated in the hospital."
