        "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has emerged as a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular (CV) disease and plays a pivotal role in coronaviruses and influenza viruses infections. The present review is primarily focused on the findings to indicate the role of ACE2 in the relationship between coronaviruses and influenza viruses with CV disease. It is postulated that the risk of coronavirus or influenza virus infection is high, at least partly, due to high ACE2 expression in population with high CV risk. Coronaviruses and influenza viruses vaccine usage in high CV risk population could be a potential strategy to prevent both CV disease and coronaviruses or influenza viruses infections.",
