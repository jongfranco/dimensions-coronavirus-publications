        "abstract": "2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is the pathogen of Corona Virus Disease 2019. Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical diagnosis. However, the positive rate is only 30-50%. Currently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR technology is mainly used to detect 2019-nCoV. According to \u201cThe Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)\u201d issued by National Health and Commission of China and \u201cThe Experts\u2019 Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV\u201d released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56\u00b0C or higher to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of 56 \u00b0C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 \u00b0C for 5 minutes when the samples were preserved by Hank\u2019s solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 \u00b0C or higher if the samples were preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted. We therefore highly recommend to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV genome and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.",

            "3.1 The integrity of nuclei acids of the 293T cells preserved in Hank\u2019s solution was damaged seriously after the sample was incubated under 56oC or above high temperature",
            "To test whether the virus inactivation progress by high temperature would disrupt the detectable template of the coronavirus, we performed a series of experiments using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Briefly, we mixed the 293T cells and PEDV coronavirus (RNA virus) and phage DNA (DNA virus) together using Hank\u2019s solution and then divided the mixture",
            "into five groups. Three groups were incubated at 56oC for 30, 45 and 60 minutes, respectively. The fourth was incubated at 92 oC for 5 minutes, and the fifth group was stored at 4oC as no inactivation control. After the high-temperature inactivation was completed, nucleic acids (including DNA and RNA) were extracted by conventional methods, and subjected to run 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Compared with the samples stored at 4 oC, both the DNA and RNA in the samples either incubated at 56 oC for 30 - 60 minutes or 92 oC for 5 minutes were degraded. The 28 S and 18 S RNA bands became indistinct and invisible in all high-temperature inactivation group and almost no electrophoretic bands could be observed in the group of 92oC inactivation (Fig. 1A).",
            "3.2 The detectable amount of the porcine coronavirus preserved in Hank\u2019s solution was reduced seriously after the sample was incubated under 56oC or above high temperature",
            "To understand the effect of the virus inactivation progress with the temperature higher than 56oC on the integrity of viral nucleic acid, we quantitated the amount of PEDV coronavirus after inactivation by qRT-PCR. Compared with the CT (threshold cycle value) of the control group that the sample was stored at 4 oC (31.94 \u00b1 0.10), the mean value of CT (32.94 \u00b1 0.18) in the group incubated at 56 oC for 30 minutes was increased by 0.996 (P< 0.01; Fig 1B; Fig. S1A, Table S1) while the mean value of CT (36.84 \u00b1 0.37) in the group treated with 92 oC for 5 minutes was increased by 4.8947 (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1C; Fig. S1A, Table S1). The results suggest that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation progress of incubation at 56 oC for 30 minutes and only 3.36% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation progress of incubation at 92 oC for 5 minutes.",
            "3.3 R503 solution was able to partially protect the integrity of nuclei acids of the 293T cells from being disrupted in the virus inactivation progress under 56oC or above high temperature",
            "To investigate whether any solutions are able to protect viral RNA integrity from",
            "disrupting during the inactivation progress with high temperature, R503 (Vazyme, China) was used to prepare the samples instead of Hank\u2019s solution. We then performed the same viral inactivation experiments as using Hank's solution. Compared with the control group that the sample was stored at 4 oC, both DNA and RNA in the samples incubated at 56 oC for 30 - 60 minutes also displayed obvious degradation, among which the 28 S and 18 S bands of total RNA of human cells were obviously smeared, and the large bands of genomic DNA became weaker while there were almost no visible genomic DNA and 28 S RNA bands in the sample incubated at 92 oC for 5 minutes (Fig 1D). However, the degradation of nucleic acid during the inactivation progress was not as serious as that of the samples prepared by Hank's solution. The results suggest that R503 should have a significant protective effect of both total RNA and genomic DNA from degradation.",
            "3.4 The detectable amount of the porcine coronavirus preserved in R503 solution was not changed after the sample was incubated under 56oC or above high temperature",
            "To determine the effect of the inactivation progress with temperature higher than 56oC on the integrity of viral nucleic acid in the samples prepared with R503, we examined the amount of porcine PEDV coronavirus by qRT-PCR as above. Compared with the CT (31.64 \u00b1 0.10) of the control group that the sample was stored at 4 oC, the mean value of CT (31.31 \u00b1 0.17) of the group incubated at 56 oC for 30 minutes had no significant change. The difference of CTs between the two groups was less than 0.5 (Fig. 1E; Figure S1B; Table S1). Moreover, the mean value of CT (31.43 \u00b1 0.08) in the group incubated at 92 oC for 5 minutes was also not changed significantly. The difference of CTs between the two groups was less than 0.5 either (Fig. 1F; Fig. S1B; Table S1). These results showed that the inactivation progress with the temperature higher than 56 oC did not significantly affect the detectable template of viral nucleic acid when it was prepared with R503, suggesting that the fragmented viral RNA could still be good for using as a template for qRT-PCR even if the viral nucleic acid was degraded.",
            "protecting the detectable amount of coronavirus RNA from disrupting, we first compared the difference of the detectable amount of coronavirus RNA between the two samples that are prepared with R503 and Hank\u2019s solution and stored at 4 oC. The results showed that the detectable amount of the viral RNA in the two prepared solutions was similar (Fig. 1G, Table S1), and the difference between the mean values of their CT was less than 0.5 (31.64 \u00b1 0.10 vs 31.95 \u00b1 0.10). The results suggest that there is no significant difference in the amount of detectable viral RNA templates between the samples prepared by either R503 or Hank\u2019s solutions that were stored at 4 oC.",
            "When the samples were incubated at 56 oC for 30 minutes, however; the CT of detected PEDV virus was 31.31 \u00b1 0.17 in the samples prepared by R503 and 32.94 \u00b1 0.18 in the ones prepared by Hank's solution, respectively. The mean value of CT of detected virus in Hank's solution was 1.6305 higher than that in R503 (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1H, Table S1). The results suggest that the detectable templates of viruses in the samples prepared by Hank's solution was only 32.30% of R503 solution after the samples were inactivated at 56 oC for 30 minutes to kill the virus.",
            "Furthermore, after inactivation at 92 oC for 5 minutes, the CT of detected PEDV virus in the two preservation solutions were 31.43 \u00b1 0.08 (R503) and 36.84 \u00b1 0.37 (Hank's), respectively. The mean value of CT of detected virus in the samples prepared by Hank's solution was 5.4125 higher than that prepared by R503 (P < 0.0001; Figure 1I, Table S1). The results reveal the detectable amount of virus in the samples prepared by Hank's solution was only 2.35% of R503 solution after the samples were inactivated at 92 oC for 5 minutes to kill the virus.",
            "3.5 The detectable amount of phage \u03bb DNA was also reduced after the sample preserved in R503 was incubated under 56oC or above high temperature",
            "In addition to the disruptive effect of the virus inactivation with high temperature on the detection of RNA virus, the detectable amount of the viral DNA (\u03bb phage) in the samples was also significantly affected. qPCR results (Fig. S1C, Table S1) showed that mean value of CT (23.55 \u00b1 0.20) of detectable virus in the samples",
            "incubated at 56oC for 30 minutes was increased by 0.5230 (P < 0.01) compared with the CT (23.02 \u00b1 0.15) of the samples stored at 4oC. The mean value of CT (25.58 \u00b1 0.21) was increased by 2.5572 (P < 0.0001) in the sample incubated at 92oC for 5 minutes.",
            "Furthermore, we examined the amount of phage DNA in the sample prepared with R503 after high temperature treatment by qPCR. The results (Fig. S1D, Table S1) showed that the mean value of CT (21.71 \u00b1 0.04) in the sample prepared by R503 and incubated at 56 oC for 30 minutes had no significant change compared with that in the control group (21.61 \u00b1 0.06) (the difference between the two was less than 0.5). The mean value of CT (22.90 \u00b1 0.26) was increased by 1.2880 in the sample that was inactivated at 92 oC for 5 minutes, suggesting that 92 oC treatment significantly reduced the detectable amount of DNA viruses in sample even prepared by R503."

        "4. Discussion": [
            "In conclusion, our results show that virus inactivation with temperature higher than 56 oC result in the degradation of viral nucleic acids seriously, which will lead to the artificial shortage of detectable templates of viral nucleic acids in samples, and finally lead to false negative of clinical detection in some samples. Preserved with the optimized solution such as R503, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be kept unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 oC or higher for killing the viruses although the integrity of cellular nucleic acids were obviously disrupted. The results suggest that if the samples were prepared with an optimal solution, the detectable numbers of viral templates would be unchanged because virus inactivation progress with high temperature does not erase all the RNA but leave small fragments of nucleic acids that are good enough for using as the template for qRT-PCR detection. If it is true for 2019-nCoV, preparing the human samples with the optimal solution can not only keep the clinical inspectors from virus infection by inactivating the virus using 56oC or higher as normal, but also improve the detection sensitivity of viral nucleic acid in the sample, leading to avoiding or at least reducing false negative",
            "results of detection. Recently, Chen reported that the inactivation by incubating the sample with 56oC for 30 min to kill the virus had no significant effect on the detection of 2019-nCoV by qRT-PCR [5]. However, combining the limitations such as only two samples tested and higher amount of virus in the two samples as the authors discussed in their researches, and our experimental evidences that the virus inactivation by high temperature did reduce the detectable amount of the porcine coronavirus template seriously, it is highly recommended to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage."
