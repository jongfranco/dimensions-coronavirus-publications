        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a newly emerged strain that has never been found in humans before. At present, the laboratory-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the main method to confirm COVID-19 infection. The intensification of the COVID-19 epidemic overwhelms limited clinical resources in particular, but not only, in developing countries, resulting in many patients not being tested for the infection and in large queues of potentially infected individuals waiting to be tested while providing a breeding ground for the disease. We describe here a rapid, highly sensitive, point-of-care, molecular test amenable for use at home, in the clinic, and at points of entry by minimally trained individuals and with minimal instrumentation. Our test is based on loop mediated isothermal amplification (COVID-19 LAMP) and for higher sensitivity on nested nucleic acid, two stage isothermal amplification (COVID-19 Penn-RAMP). Both tests can be carried out in closed tubes with either fluorescence or colorimetric (e.g., leuco crystal violet LCV) detection. COVID-19 LAMP performs on par with COVID-19 RT-PCR. COVID-19 RAMP has 10 fold better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMP and COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing purified targets and 100 times better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMP and COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing rapidly prepared sample mimics. Due to fortunate scarcity of COVID-19 infections in the USA, we were not able to test our assays and methods with patient samples. We hope that such tests will be carried out by colleagues in impacted countries.  Our Closed-Tube Penn-RAMP has the potential to significantly reduce false negatives while being amenable to use with minimal instrumentation and training. &lt;/p&gt;",

The intensification of the COVID-19 epidemic overwhelms limited clinical resources in particular, but not only, in developing countries, resulting in many patients not being tested for the infection and in large queues of potentially infected individuals waiting to be tested while providing a breeding ground for the disease. We describe here a rapid, highly sensitive, point-of-care, molecular test amenable for use at home, in the clinic, and at points of entry by minimally trained individuals and with minimal instrumentation. Our test is based on loop mediated isothermal amplification (COVID-19 LAMP) and for higher sensitivity on nested nucleic acid, two stage isothermal amplification (COVID-19",

        "Introduction": [
            "Coronaviruses are a large family of RNA viruses including HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 that usually cause mild respiratory illnesses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] with the exceptions of the fatal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS)",

However, RT-PCR tests require well-equipped laboratories and skilled personnel. The growing number of suspected cases exceeds the capacity of many hospitals, leaving many patients untested challenging to the control of the disease. A rapid, point -of \u2013care molecular diagnostics for the COVID-19 is urgently needed.",
            "We report here on simple closed-tube molecular tests for COVID-19 that can be carried out at home and in the clinic by minimally trained personnel without a need for sophisticated equipment. Using bioinformatics, we have identified highly conserved sequences in the COVID-19 and we have designed primers targeting the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) gene of the COVID-19",
            "RNA. Previously, we have shown that RT-LAMP successfully detects pathogen nucleic acids with either bioluminescent indicator and smartphone [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] or colorimetrically and with minimal instrumentation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Since many COVID-19 infected individuals are reported negative in the commonly used RT-PCR test, we address the need for a higher sensitivity test with our two-stage isothermal method, dubbed Penn-RAMP [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. We have originally developed Penn-RAMP to enable high level of multiplexing, but surreptitiously discovered that, in many cases, our two-stage method is 10 times more sensitive than LAMP and PCR when processing purified nucleic acids and 100 times more sensitive than LAMP and RT-PCR with minimally processed samples.",
            "Since at the time of writing this paper, only a very small number of COVID19 cases have been identified in the USA, we have not been able to test our assay with actual patient samples.

We measured the amplification threshold time as a function of sample incubation time and incubation temperature and determined that incubation for over 15 min at temperature above 65\u00b0C is enough to lyse the virus and suppress inhibitors (Figure S1) with a relatively small increase in threshold time and reduced reproducibility (Figure",
