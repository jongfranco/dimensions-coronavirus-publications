Furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that ACE2 and TMPRSSs are highly coexpressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. Our results provide the bioinformatics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate its potential target cells.",

Here we used the alignment, furin score and homology modeling to compare the sequence of the S1/S2 and S2' cleavage sites between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 1c). The amino acid sequence of the",

Its furin score was 0.688, which was obviously higher than that of the corresponding sequence in SARS-CoV (0.139), indicating that the insertion sequence may increase the cleavage efficiency by proteases (Fig. 2b).",

            "Structurally, TMPRSSs include extracellular domain, transmembrane domain and intracellular domain in which extracellular domain is the main catalytic domain. They show similar substrate-specificity and catalytic mechanism. Take TMPRSS2 as an example. The catalytic triad consisted of H296, D345 and S441 and the substrate binding residue D435, a conserved aspartate residue, was located in the bottom of pocket[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. The substrate binding pocket is deeper than most of serine proteinase (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b). The bottom of the catalytic pocket has a negatively charged aspartic acid residue which can facilitate the binding and stabilization of arginine or lysine residues in the P1 position[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].",

The conformation of the insertion sequence in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and TMPRSS2 was next simulated by molecular docking. We found the insertion sequence formed a loop which was easily recognized by the catalytic pocket of TMPRSS2 (Extended Data Fig. 2f, g). Thus, both the furin score and molecular docking revealed that the insertion sequence of SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the TMPRSS2 recognition and S protein cleavage.",

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, two betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, result in persistent public panics and became the most significant public health events[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. In December",
            "2019, a novel identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) induced an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei, China 7. The rapidly increasing number of",
            "SARS-CoV-2-infected cases suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted effectively among humans and give rise to a high pandemic potential 7,8,24.",
            "Previous studies identified that SARS-CoV mutated between 2002 and 2004 to better bind to its cell receptor, replicate in human cells and enhance the virulence 9. Thus, it is important to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 behaves like SARS-CoV to adapt to the host cell. Notably, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share the same receptor protein",

Besides, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 with the similar affinity as SARS-CoV RBD does[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Thus, during the process of viral and host cellular membrane fusion, whether the specific structure of",
            "SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-26.",
            "In this study, we found the furin score of the S1/S2 cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 was higher than that of SARS, implying a more degree of hydrolysis. Through the comparison of the two structures, R682, R683 and relative S680, P681 extended the original exposed loop combined with R685 of SARS-CoV-2, which was more suitable for hydrolysis by TMPRSSs. The substrate specificity of TMPRSSs are almost similar, revealing a strong preference for arginine or lysine residues in the P1 position represented by R. More R (R682, R683 and R685) in the S1/S2 cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 can enhance the cleavage of S1 with S2, which means that the structurally constrains of S1 on S2 is removed, and the fusion peptides in S2 are exposed and insert into the target host cell membrane, finally it increases the efficiency of fuse membranes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].",

However, the results of protein sequence alignment revealed that the similar sequence of the reported fourth insertion site (680-SPRR-683) in SARS-CoV-2 was commonly found in many beta-coronavirus.

Moreover, we also found the endocytosis-associated genes was highly expressed in AT2 cells, implying that endocytosis may also facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. As the alveolar stem-like cells, AT2 cells are in charge of surfactant biosynthesis, self-renewal and immunoregulation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 not only damages the AT2 cells leading to the direct injury to alveoli, but also raises alveolar surface tension to induce dyspnea[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Additionally, the injuryed AT2 also damages the immunologic balance in alveoli and results in inflammatory cascade[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. In addition, they are also highly co-expressed in absorptive enterocytes and upper epithelial cells of esophagus, implying that intestinal epithelium and esophagus epithelium may also be the potential target tissues.
