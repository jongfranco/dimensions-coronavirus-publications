            "Evolution requires genetic diversity, and genetic diversity arises from two distinct mechanisms: mutation and recombination. Mutation is the replacement of one nucleotide base with another, or the addition/removal of nucleotide(s). Mutations are the only true source of genetic novelty. Recombination, on the other hand, can increase genetic diversity by placing existing mutations into new genetic backgrounds. Two articles in the most recent issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases explore these sources of genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2. Li and colleagues describe the genetic variability within 7 COVID-19 patients from China. Yi explores potential instances of recombination among 84 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from multiple countries."
