In what ways does this awareness impact their sensory experience?",
            "While I do not argue against being mindful of the impact of one\u2019s actions on the use and enjoyment of public space by others, the sign in my library signals a regime of sensory discipline and judgment disguised as a call to civility. This is a familiar rhetorical and regulatory move embedded in long histories of racialized and colonial hierarchies of sensation. The standard of behavior required is impossible, requiring the consuming patron to inhabit another\u2019s body, not only to sense as another does but also to anticipate the other\u2019s thresholds of sensory tolerance, comfort, and taste. Is slurping noodles in soup better or worse than the crinkling of a chip bag? Am I crunching my carrot sticks too loudly (for you)? Eating and drinking are life-sustaining practices shaped, among other things, by the specificities of individual bodies and cultural belongings. Do the librarians charged with enforcing this policy receive more complaints about curry than pizza? Which sounds and smells blend into the dominant sensescape of a shared space and are thus beneath (regulatory) notice? Which sensations interrupt, and hence are coded as violation(s)?",
            "In circumscribing quotidian sensory activity through soft law and according to prior normative standards, which inevitably have differential impact on its subjects of attention, my library is engaged in sensuous governance. Sensuous governance implicates",
            "S. N. HAMILTON hierarchical social institutions, relies upon particular sensory knowledge-making practices and knowing systems, and makes and remakes sensational subjects as within or outside of recognized norms. Answering the still relevant call for more \u201csensuous scholarship\u201d (Stoller 1997), the concept of sensuous governance interrogates the myriad ways in which sensing \u2013 embodied being, experiencing, and inter-acting in the world \u2013 is integrated into the juridification of social life (see <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHolmberg_2014_a\" href=\"#rHolmberg_2014_a\">Holmberg 2014</a>). It invites us to consider what a governing rationality of the sensorial might look like \u2013 or more precisely \u2013 feel like.",
            "Sensuous governance is located within the emergent field of sensori-legal studies (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHowes_2019_a\" href=\"#rHowes_2019_a\">Howes 2019</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHamilton_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rHamilton_et+al_2017_a\">Hamilton et al 2017</a>),1 and draws upon and extends the productive set of questions offered by governmentality studies (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFoucault_1991_a\" href=\"#rFoucault_1991_a\">Foucault 1991</a>, 2009; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBurchell_1991_a\" href=\"#rBurchell_1991_a\">Burchell 1991</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHunt_1994_a\" href=\"#rHunt_1994_a\">Hunt and Wickham 1994</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDean_1999_a\" href=\"#rDean_1999_a\">Dean 1999</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWalters_2011_a\" href=\"#rWalters_2011_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWalters_2011_a\" href=\"#rWalters_2011_a\">Walters 2011</a></a>). Governance thinking directs us to the relations and rationalities of governing. It unpacks the ways in which everyday regulatory practices are shaped by larger governing logics which make, rather than discover, their objects of intervention. Sites of governance are thus spaces where technologies of power and technologies of the self intersect (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWalters_2011_a\" href=\"#rWalters_2011_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWalters_2011_a\" href=\"#rWalters_2011_a\">Walters 2011</a></a>, 15). Governmentality studies troubles the assumption that power operates in a top-down manner where governors act on the governed. Instead, it recognizes that in contemporary governance, subjects are induced by regulatory systems to modify their own behaviors in relation to particular norms, to self-govern, and that this work takes place in the realms of everyday life. A variety of expert knowledges become central to the production of those norms and the work of setting (and thus solving) the \u201cproblems\u201d to be regulated.",
            "While governmentality theory offers much to the notion of sensuous governance, as Mariana Valverde (2015) correctly recognizes, it often overlooks the emotional, aesthetic, and affective dimensions of social and socio-legal life (33). The sensorial could be added to Valverde\u2019s list of governmentality\u2019s oversights. Sensuous governance therefore seeks, not merely to incorporate the senses into the examination of the ways in which relations of governing operate, but rather to fully integrate sensation and the sensorium in understanding how governance is (and has always been) embodied knowing, guiding, forming. Uli Linke argues in his consideration of the sensual life of the state, \u201c[p]olitical worlds have a visual, tactile, sensory and emotional dimension . . . . Modern governmentalities act on and inhabit the body\u201d (2006, 206; see further <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHowes_2014_b\" href=\"#rHowes_2014_b\">Howes and Classen 2014</a>). The articles in this special issue illustrate the sensations of politics, not only, or even primarily at the level of the state, but at the level of quotidian life \u2013 eating and grocery shopping for one\u2019s family; using a cell phone to film a police officer speaking to the driver of a car they pulled over; donning a smart watch before going for a run as one trains for a half-marathon; watching a ghost-hunter reality television show; wandering the halls of a museum; or going online to commiserate with, and learn from, other sufferers of a skin condition.",
            "Sensuous governance assumes that sensory perceptions interact and co-constitute each other in complex ways, what <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHowes_2005_a\" href=\"#rHowes_2005_a\">Howes (2005</a>) calls \u201cintersensoriality.\u201d We never experience our senses in isolation from each other and further, the senses are not simply biological or primarily personal, but fundamentally cultural. As a result, the sensory realm is pervaded by power relations: \u201c[t]he senses are gateways of knowledge [and] instruments of power . . ..\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHowes_2005_a\" href=\"#rHowes_2005_a\">Howes 2005</a>).",
            "The production of and traffic in sensory knowledge, or sensologies, is central to relations of sensuous governance. Drawing upon the work of <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNewhauser_2014_a\" href=\"#rNewhauser_2014_a\">Newhauser (2014</a>, cf. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHolmberg_2014_a\" href=\"#rHolmberg_2014_a\">Holmberg 2014</a>), sensologies denote specific forms of sensory knowing, anchored in the body logics of their time and place, that make the sensorium amenable to regulatory action. The articles in this collection make visible, and thus available to analysis and critique, the sensologies upon which contemporary practices of sensory governance rely. These sensologies evoke, produce, and reproduce, sensual norms, and yet, as sensing subjects we neither precede, nor are determined by, those norms. Judith Butler reminds us that \u201c[n]orms act on us from all sides, that is, in multiple and contradictory ways; they act upon a sensibility at the same time that they form it; they lead us to feel in certain ways, and those feelings can enter into our thinking even, as we might well end up thinking about them\u201d (2015, 5).",
            "Finally, a brief note on language: the double entendre of the word \u201csensuous\u201d is deliberate. The Oxford English Dictionary advises that historically, \u201csensuous\u201d was a more neutral term than \u201csensual,\u201d merely \u201crelating to the senses,\u201d rather than to their gratification. As the lore has it, John Milton (1641) first invoked \u201csensuous\u201d specifically in order to avoid the sexual implications of \u201csensual.\u201d \u201cWhile traditionalists struggle to maintain a distinction, the evidence suggests that the neutral use of sensuous is rare in modern English\u201d (OED 2020). The sensuous in sensuous governance eschews the fool\u2019s game of neutrality and demands that in matters sensate, we not lose sight of the prospect of pleasure. Governance and gratification should never be, a priori, mutually exclusive.",
            "\u222b\u222b\u222b Using a framework of sensuous governance, we can ask: How do sensory attributes become quantified and amenable to calculation? Through which technologies and techniques do we render the sensorium knowable and thus an object of possible regulation, legislation, or juridification? How do differently sensing and sensed subjects get streamed into different echelons of social organization, institutions, and social spaces? How do they then navigate those complicated \u201cfields of impressionability\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cButler_2015_a\" href=\"#rButler_2015_a\">Butler 2015</a>, 11)? How do governmental agents use their sensory impressions in order to render judgment? How do sensational subjects accede to and/or exceed regulatory apparatuses? The articles in this issue take up the spirit and the letter of these questions in productive and stimulating ways. Marc Lafrance and R. Scott Carey offer an important reminder that the skin is our largest sense organ, orchestrating and enabling, touch, sight and taste in ways that are often inextricably entangled. In \u201cSensing the skin: acne sufferers and the dermatologization of life\u201d they challenge us to think past the medicalization of the skin to the dermatologisation of life \u2013 that is, the ways in which key elements of the daily life of those with acne are \u201cassigned a dermatological significance,\u201d a significance that impacts how they experience their own skin, their ways of \u201cskin sensing.\u201d Lafrance and Carey\u2019s case study comprises an analysis of central narratives on the website acne.org \u2013 an online community forum for those with, or interested in, acne. The authors highlight narratives of hormones, food, and sleep, revealing that the skin sensing practices and discourses of the forum\u2019s participants produce the skin as, not a passive surface upon which medical and other knowledges are inscribed, but rather, in their eloquent phrase, a \u201csomatic theatre\u201d in which subjects, their bodies, and their experiences are staged. The authors\u2019 object of analysis powerfully articulates how people sense, sense with, and make sense of, their skin. These experiences are never simply determined by social institutions, even ones as powerful as medicine and dermatological science.",
            "Like acne sufferers, endurance athletes, too, are engaged in practices of embodied selfmonitoring and management that generate a range of affects. However, as Michael S. Mopas and Ekaterina Huybregts demonstrate in, \u201cTraining by feel: wearable fitnesstrackers, endurance athletes, and the sensing of data,\u201d the sensorium of these athletes\u2019 bodies is extended through digital technology and \u201cdata sensing\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLupton_2018_a\" href=\"#rLupton_2018_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLupton_2018_a\" href=\"#rLupton_2018_a\">Lupton and Maslen 2018</a></a>, 649) into a sensory circuit comprised of fitness tracking technology, their bodily sensations, and self- and other-generated performance norms. The athletes Mopas and Huybregts interview express how these technologies not only track their fitness but extend the body\u2019s sensory abilities, seamlessly integrating into their somatic schema. In looking to the device to help them make sense of how they feel, like the police use of body-cams Jessica J. Chapman discusses in her article, these subjects enact a \u201cmore-thanhuman sensorium\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLupton_2018_a\" href=\"#rLupton_2018_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLupton_2018_a\" href=\"#rLupton_2018_a\">Lupton and Maslen 2018</a></a>); yet, unlike their police counterparts, the athletes\u2019 pleasure of the mediated sensation is more evident and less dangerous. The hybrid entity of the body-device that the authors theorize works against discourses of sensorial or embodied purity and authenticity, making porous the line between human and nonhuman sensing. Yet while the data-sense produced by the use of these devices generates self-judgments of pleasure, frustration, disappointment, or triumph, it also produces sense data of interest to marketers, insurers, and states.",
            "Risk management practices are central to contemporary governance, namely the identification of risky objects and the consequent development of mechanisms to control, or control for, that risk. Charlene Elliott\u2019s fascinating study of the Canadian government\u2019s construction and management of kids\u2019 food as an object of risk testifies to the challenges of regulating taste. \u201cFrom fun to fraught: marketing to kids and regulating \u2018risky foods\u2019 in Canada\u201d points out a tension between the ways in which packaged food targeted at children operates simultaneously as both risk object and child object. As child object, food is seen to generate pleasure and identity. When these same foods are constituted as risk objects, a \u201cclash of values\u201d occurs. Health and pleasure are placed in conflict by the regulatory regime. Again, we see mediation\u2019s relevance as regulatory attention sticks both to certain foodstuffs deemed unhealthy for children, and to the child-oriented advertising of foodstuffs (whether healthy or not). Both candy and communication can harm. Elliott illustrates that regulation relies upon scenarios and models for guiding sensory practices and experiences. The competing nutrient profiling models she discusses privilege different risk factors and thus offer different targets for governmental anxiety.",
            "Not dissimilarly from endurance athletes, contemporary police officers wear, and begin to sense like, their technologies of sensory extension, in this case, video cameras. Yet as Jessica Chapman points out, police increasingly work in an environment of ubiquitous techno-sensing where citizens turn their hand-held cameras on the state. The resulting sensory record(ing)s are often translated into evidence in cases where police are alleged to have used excessive force. Too often, video in the courtroom is assumed to be solely visual and its audition ignored, subordinated, or treated as self-evidently true. While asking how it is that courts hear, in \u201cIntroducing audio-vision into evidence: the impact of audio recordings and their technical limitations in police use of force cases,\u201d Chapman does not suggest replacing law\u2019s well-documented ocularcentrism with a new focus on aurality, but rather to make the intersensorial move to understanding \u201caudiovision\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChion_1994_a\" href=\"#rChion_1994_a\">Chion 1994</a>). To explore the sonic register, we must consider the technological affordances of recording and transmitting media. Chapman\u2019s attention to media enables the consideration of the ways in which what the court hears differs from the sounds of the event itself \u2013 due both to the technologies and the technical and social norms of auditory relevance governing what is valued as sound and what is dismissed as noise. Chapman provides a rich theoretical palette and her work reminds us to pay attention to legally neglected sensations. She pulls back the curtain on mediation practices that we too often take for granted, to expose \u201cshadow media\u201d to the light of day. She asks us to think where lies the lie, not in the sense of deliberate deception, but in looking for the points in the circuit of mediated sensory experience that disrupt the \u201ctruthiness\u201d of our sensational stories and destabilize our sensory comfort zones.",
            "The notion of trust in our own sensations, in the \u201ctestimony of the body\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAgnew_2019_a\" href=\"#rAgnew_2019_a\">Agnew 2019</a>, 77), and its relationship with audiovisual media is also at the heart of Jarkko Toikkanen\u2019s engaging analysis of paranormal reality television and its generation of imagined touch in \u201cFeeling the unseen: imagined touch perceptions in paranormal reality television.\u201d. Rather than the imagination being false or untrue, somehow less than the \u201creal\u201d experience of the haptic encounter, he argues that the sensations evoked by these television shows are all the more powerful because they are imagined. Drawing on the concepts of \u201cekphrasis\u201d and \u201chypotyposis\u201d from intermediality scholarship, he maps the ways in which the sensory register of an experience is transformed \u2013 how in seeing and hearing, we can feel through our skin. As in many articles in this issue, the medium matters, not because it determines experience, and certainly not because it distorts true sensation, but because our sensory experiences are enabled and constrained by perceptible and perceptive media technologies. Like James S. Bielo revealing the expert design choices producing the \u201csensory gymnasium\u201d (Howes 2015, 265) and Chapman attending to the media affordances of audio recording devices, Toikkanen considers the rhetorical and visual techniques of audio-visual mediation, resisting the tendency to gloss the work of sensory transformation or render it, by inattention or assumption, either magical or manipulative. He asks: \u201cWhy and how exactly is it that media mediate?\u201d (Toikkanen 2020, 74), tuning our expectations to certain sensory orientations. The experience Toikkanen seeks to capture doesn\u2019t rely on the perceiver\u2019s preexisting belief in the paranormal phenomenon, or on their being convinced of the veracity of the experience portrayed in the television program, only on their familiarity with the genre of paranormal investigation in its televisual mode. In these programs, the \u201cunsensed\u201d is rendered sensible, despite the everpresent risk that it may be non-sense.",
            "Running through this collection is an awareness of the ways in which various technologies and techniques of sensuous governance teach us to sense differently and Constance Classen\u2019s article is particularly concerned with this theme. In, \u201cThe senses at the National Gallery: art as sensory recreation, refinement, and regulation in Victorian England,\u201d the author takes us back to the plurisensory site of London\u2019s National Gallery, contrasting the sensory ideal it was designed and managed to promulgate and the more messy reality of sensorial life within its walls. Classen\u2019s analysis considers how sensory governance has long been a civilizing project, intimately tied to the construction of propriety \u2013 those who know how to sense properly \u2013 in the service of civic goals. Governance is often enacted in and through cultural institutions, those seeking to discipline embodied experience and produce more docile subjects, in her evocative words, \u201ctransforming social disorder into social order and destructive sensuality into compliant sensitivity\u201d (2020, 85). However, as Classen so richly details, the bodily practices of sensing subjects inevitably leak out of the strictures of institutional regulation, not necessarily always as an assertion of agency or class awareness (although that is also possible), but sometimes merely because sensing and being sensed are complicated and complicating activities.",
            "Cross the Atlantic Ocean and fast forward just over a century, and we encounter another cultural institution seeking to produce sensory experiences, the Museum of the Bible, in Washington, D.C. Refreshingly, rather than offering an ideological critique of the representations in the museum, James Bielo examines how, through the practices of experiential design, the museum mobilizes sensory modes and stages sensory experiences. \u201cExperiential design and religious publicity at D.C.\u2019s Museum of the Bible\u201d asks, \u201cwhat media genres and attendant sensory configurations are authorized in processes of religious publicity?\u201d (Bielo 2020, 100). In contrast to the National Gallery of London, interactivity and immersive storytelling have become specific techniques in the \u201cexperience economy\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKlingman_2007_a\" href=\"#rKlingman_2007_a\">Klingman 2007</a>, 6) of the contemporary museum. Like Chapman, Bielo digs into the sensory technologies, speaking to the experience designers themselves to understand the mediated construction of anticipated (and orchestrated) sensation. The designers rely upon what Bielo calls a \u201chistorically durable ideology of sensation,\u201d one that rests on an abiding trust in our bodies and our senses \u201cbecause we listen to them as responding in an unmediated way\u201d (2020, 108). Like the other work in this issue, Bielo\u2019s analysis troubles this ideology of the purity of experience, of non-mediated sensation.",
            "Together these papers offer resources for thinking about the regulation, norms, and knowledges that engage and shape our sensory experiences in many sites of contemporary life. They denaturalize the sensory domain, demanding that we think of the ways that our experiences are always, already mediated. They push scholars working at the intersection of legal studies and sensory studies to continue to look past the formal structures of law and to understand quotidian sensory experiences as surveilled, managed, guided, taught, selfevaluated, and circumscribed. Our senses are rendered recognizable and knowable both to ourselves and to governing systems through the language and ideas of certain types of expertise and an increasing array of complex digital and data-dependent technologies. Regulated bodies become impure hybrids and regulatory regimes operate through our practices of consumption, work, leisure, and pleasure. Sensuous governance is productive activity in which we are all engaged, making and remaking our sensory experiences in language and legal consciousness, aligning our bodies with norms, measuring and being measured, and, always, telling stories to make sense of it all.",
            "As I complete the final edits to this introduction, I am listening to a recording of citizens in Wuhan, China leaning out of their windows singing songs and chanting, \u201cKeep it up, Wuhan,\u201d trying to raise morale under the quarantine conditions the Chinese government established in an attempt to control the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus. These sounds, thousands of kilometers away from where I sit, in languages I do not speak, are beautiful, resonant, moving. In a context where formal and informal regulation proliferates, touch is off-limits, and lines of sight complicated, sound prevails. Relations of sensuous governance simultaneously produce subjects both sensible and sensitive \u2013 our experiences are rendered legible to the regulatory impulse in the sensorial register, and yet this encapsulation is never total. Always, regulation also enables the assertion of the sensational.",

            "Hierarchical social institutions, relies upon particular sensory knowledge-making practices and knowing systems, and makes and remakes sensational subjects as within or outside of recognized norms."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Not merely to incorporate the senses into the examination of the ways in which relations of governing operate, but rather to fully integrate sensation and the sensorium in understanding how governance is embodied knowing, guiding, forming.",
            "Sensuous governance assumes that sensory perceptions interact and co-constitute each other in complex ways, what <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHowes_2005_a\" href=\"#rHowes_2005_a\">Howes (2005</a>) calls \u201cintersensoriality.\u201d We never experience our senses in isolation from each other and further, the senses are not biological or primarily personal, but fundamentally cultural.",
            "Mopas and Ekaterina Huybregts demonstrate in, \u201cTraining by feel: wearable fitnesstrackers, endurance athletes, and the sensing of data,\u201d the sensorium of these athletes\u2019 bodies is extended through digital technology and \u201cdata sensing\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLupton_2018_a\" href=\"#rLupton_2018_a\">Lupton and Maslen 2018</a>, 649) into a sensory circuit comprised of fitness tracking technology, their bodily sensations, and self- and other-generated performance norms.",
            "Bielo revealing the expert design choices producing the \u201csensory gymnasium\u201d (Howes 2015, 265) and Chapman attending to the media affordances of audio recording devices, Toikkanen considers the rhetorical and visual techniques of audio-visual mediation, resisting the tendency to gloss the work of sensory transformation or render it, by inattention or assumption, either magical or manipulative.",
            "Running through this collection is an awareness of the ways in which various technologies and techniques of sensuous governance teach them to sense differently and Constance Classen\u2019s article is concerned with this theme.",
            "Like Chapman, Bielo digs into the sensory technologies, speaking to the experience designers themselves to understand the mediated construction of anticipated sensation.",
            "Together these papers offer resources for thinking about the regulation, norms, and knowledges that engage and shape the sensory experiences in many sites of contemporary life."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Sensuous governance is productive activity in which the authors are all engaged, making and remaking the sensory experiences in language and legal consciousness, aligning the bodies with norms, measuring and being measured, and, always, telling stories to make sense of it all.",
            "Relations of sensuous governance simultaneously produce subjects both sensible and sensitive \u2013 the experiences are rendered legible to the regulatory impulse in the sensorial register, and yet this encapsulation is never total."
