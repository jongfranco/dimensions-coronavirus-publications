            "In the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease, investigating, classifying, tracking, and managing contacts by identifying the patient\u2019s route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease. However, omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient. To overcome these limitations, methods that can objectively verify the patient\u2019s claims (medical facility records, Global Positioning System, card transactions, and closed-circuit television) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in South Korea."

            "If there are several unknown epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and an effective medical intervention is lacking, contact management becomes 1 of the core strategies to minimize additional transmission.",
            "For these strategies to be successful, it is necessary to evaluate between-person exposure risk in all locations where there have been confirmed cases, and to classify contact persons based on this risk.",

        "Results": [
            "COVID-19 contact investigation and management comprised of the following: 1) determination of the location of the contact, 2) exposure risk evaluation, 3) contact classification, and 4) contact management.",
            "The location of the contact was determined through the process of preliminary identification, by interviewing patients, and their acquaintances, and by objective verification of the investigated information.",
            "Exposure risk evaluation was performed depending on the route of disease transmission, patient characteristics, and environmental characteristics.",
            "The method of managing the classified contacts was largely distinguished between movement restriction and symptom monitoring."
