        "abstract": "It has been reported that ACE2 is the main host cell receptor of 2019-nCoV and plays a crucial role in the entry of virus into the cell to cause the final infection. To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected. RNA-seq profiling data of 13 organ types with para-carcinoma normal tissues from TCGA and 14 organ types with normal tissues from FANTOM5 CAGE were analyzed in order to explore and validate the expression of ACE2 on the mucosa of oral cavity. Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the ACE2 expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity. Interestingly, this receptor was highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue. Preliminarily, those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in dental clinical practice as well as daily life.",

Study of Zhou et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] indicated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is likely the cell receptor of 2019-nCoV, which were also the receptor for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL637,8.

The study of Xu et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] found that the RBD domain of the 2019-nCoV S-protein supports strong interaction with human ACE2 molecules. These findings suggest that the ACE2 plays an important role in cellular entry, thus ACE2-expressing cells may act as target cells and are susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",
            "The expression and distribution of the ACE2 in human body may indicate the potential infection routes of 2019-nCoV. Through the developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technique and single-cell transcriptomes based on the public database, researchers analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile at single-cell resolution. High ACE2 expression was identified in type II alveolar cells (AT2) of lung[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], cholangiocytes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], myocardial cells, kidney proximal tubule cells, and bladder urothelial cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].

The result showed that the ACE2 could be expressed in the oral cavity, and was highly enriched in epithelial cells.

Xu et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] RESULTS Public bulk RNA-seq dataset analysis NA-seq profile data of 13 organs including 695 para-carcinoma normal tissues as control from public TCGA were obtained for our analysis, and Fig. 1a showed that ACE2 could be expressed in various organs, the mean expression of different organs could be found in Table 1. According to the mean expression of ACE2, the mucosa of oral cavity could express ACE2, and the results were validated by the data of normal tissues from the FANTOM5 CAGE dataset (Fig. 1b). To investigate the ACE2 expression on mucosa of oral cavity, we looked into the ACE2 expression in different oral sites. According to the site information provided by the TCGA, among the 32 adjacent normal tissues, 13 tissues located in the oral tongue, 2 tissues located in the base of tongue, 3 tissues located in the floor of mouse, and 14 tissues did not definite the site and were just put into the category of oral cavity. The mean expression distribution of different sites was shown in Fig. 1c. When we combined the base of tongue, floor of mouth and oral cavity as other sites, and compared them with oral tongue, we found the obvious tendency that the mean expression of ACE2 was higher in oral tongue (13 tissues) than others (19 tissues) (Fig. 1d), while may due to the limitation of the sample size, the p value was not significant (P = 0.062).",
            "Single cell RNA-seq analysis of oral tissues Single cell RNA-seq was utilized for four oral tissues, and the data was analyzed to confirm the above results and assess the cell typespecific expression of ACE2. After the data preprocessing (shown in section \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d), 22 969 cells were acquired and 7 cell types were identified (Fig. 2a), including epithelial cells (marker genes including SFN, KRT6A, and KRT10), fibroblasts (marker genes including FAP, PDPN, COL1A2, DCN, COL3A1, COL6A1), T cells (marker genes including CD2, CD3D, CD3E, and CD3G), macrophages (marker genes including CD163, CSF1R, CD68, and FCGR2A), mast cells (marker genes including CMA1, MS4A2, TPSAB1, TPSB2), B cells (marker genes including SLAMF7, FCRL5, and CD79A) and endothelial cells (marker genes including PECAM1, VWF, and ENG). The heatmap of main cell markers across the cell types can be found in Fig. 2b.",

Figure 2e shows that the ACE2-positive cells could be found in oral tissues including epithelial cells (1.19% ACE2-positive cells), T cells (<0.5%), B cells (<0.5%), and fibroblast (<0.5%), and the ACE2 was highly enriched in epithelial cells, of which 93.38% ACE2positive cells belong to epithelial cells (Fig. 2f). The above results indicated that the ACE2 could be expressed on the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa and highly enriched in tongue epithelial cells."

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "In the last two decades, coronavirus has caused two large-scale pandemics, SARS in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome",
            "nCov) induced an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, restated the risk of coronaviruses posed to public health[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. The infection routes and pathogenesis of 2019-nCov are not fully understood by far, and the study of 2019-nCoV host cell receptor ACE2 could be valuable for the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19.",
            "In this study, the analysis of public bulk-seq RNA datasets showed that the mucosa of oral cavity could express the ACE2 and was higher in tongue than other oral sites. The results of this study were consistent with the study of Zou et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] in general, many organs with higher expression of ACE2 than lung, such as intestine, heart, and kidney. According to the study of Zhao et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], the ACE2 expression in lung is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2), that may cause the relatively low ACE2 expression of lung in bulk-seq RNA datasets analysis. Even though, the result of Zou et al indicated that the respiratory tract should also be considered as a vulnerable target to 2019-nCoV infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",
            "The results of our single cell RNA-seq profiles validated the ACE2 expression in oral cavity, and the level of ACE2 expression in oral tissues was higher in tongue than buccal or gingival tissues. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that the",
            "ACE2-positive cells were enriched in epithelial cells, which was also reported by previous study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. These findings indicated that oral cavity could be regarded as potentially high risk for 2019-nCov infectious susceptibility.",
            "Interestingly, we found that the ACE2 also expressed in lymphocytes within oral mucosa, and similar results were found in various organs of the digestive system and in lungs[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].",
            "Whether those facts have reminded the 2019-nCoV attacks the lymphocytes and leads to the severe illness of patients needs more in vitro and in vivo evidence and validations, though the proportion of ACE2-positive lymphocytes is quite small.",
            "Previous studies have investigated the ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in various tissues by bulk samples[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], however, the distribution of ACE2 through bulk data could not indicate the cell type-specific expression of ACE2. Recently developed single-cell RNAsequencing technology enabled the generation of vast amounts of the transcriptomic data at cellular resolution[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. The ACE2 expression profile in various organs, tissues, and cell types, provides the bioinformatics evidence for the potential infection routes of 2019-",

            "Although studies have reported multiple symptoms of hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], some cases at home",
            "3 might be asymptomatic. It is worth noting that, a previous study showed that 99% of the patients had no clinical manifestation of oral human papillomavirus (HPV), but HPV DNA was detected in 81% of oral mucosa samples, and anti-HPV IgA was detected in the saliva of 44% of the patients[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Likewise, although 2019-ncov infection hardly presented oral symptoms, the ACE2 expression in the oral cavity indicated that the oral infection route of 2019-nCoV cannot be excluded. Moreover, a latest pilot experiment showed that 4 out of 62 stool specimens tested positive to 2019-nCoV, and another four patients in a separate cohort who tested positive to rectal swabs had the 2019-nCoV being detected in the gastrointestinal tract, saliva, or urine[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Thus, our results support that in addition to the respiratory droplets and direct contact, fecal\u2013oral transmission might also be the route of transmission of 2019-nCoV.",
            "Our results are mainly based on public datasets and single cell RNA-sequencing data of in-house oral tissues with minimal diseased lesion which from our previous project found no significant expression difference among the common epithelial markers in our past study and other previous study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. It is warrant that further histological methods are used to confirm our results and enhance the persuasion of the conclusion.",
            "The ACE2-expressing cells in oral tissues, especially in epithelial cells of tongue, might provide possible routes of entry for the 2019-nCov, which indicate oral cavity might be a potential risk route of 2019-nCov infection. Those preliminary findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provide a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in clinical practice as well as daily life."
