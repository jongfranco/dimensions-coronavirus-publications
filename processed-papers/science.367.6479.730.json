But now, the rapid spread of a novel coronavirus, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern last month, will overshadow his stated priorities. It puts Tedros in a difficult position: If he wants WHO to stay informed about what's happening in China and influence how the country handles the epidemic, he cannot afford to antagonize the notoriously touchy Chinese government\u2014even though it is clear the country has been less than fully transparent about the outbreak's early stages, and perhaps still is. And how Tedros handles the unfolding crisis will shape not just his legacy, but the future of WHO.",
