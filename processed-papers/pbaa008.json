Chinese hospitals, especially those in Hubei Province, are facing increasing admission of infected patients, and the epidemics involve hospitals across all levels, some of which may not be fully prepared.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Thus, there has been an urgent need for practical guidance to protect the health of both patients and healthcare professionals, the highest-risk people in the battle against the fatal virus infection. However, most existing documents were based on expert opinions and consensuses, calling for evidence-supported decision-making guidance.",
            "In response to this emergence, the West China Hospital (WCH) of Sichuan University initiated the urgent evidence-based guideline approach (i.e., West China Urgent Recommendations, English version shown as Supplementary Material@) that aimed to offer timely recommendations for healthcare practitioners and institutes about the hospital disease control during the viral epidemics.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Based on the MAGIC (making GRADE the irresistible choice) evidence ecosystem,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] this urgent guideline approach was adapted specifically for the present outbreak and future public health emergencies.
