Approval for a conversion ban transcends political party \u2014 self-identified Republicans and Democrats expressed equal levels of support \u2014 buttressing claims that the issue is not a partisan one. Accordingly, LGBTQ advocates are seeing a growing willingness to consider bans in red states such as Oklahoma and Kentucky. \u201cUtah opened the door to conversation,\u201d said Sam Brinton, head of advocacy and government affairs for The Trevor Project, an organization that focuses on suicide prevention among LGBTQ youths. \u201cTroy Williams, who helped lead the fight to make the Utah the 19th state to establish a conversion ban, said lawmakers from Idaho, Arizona, Kentucky and Iowa have reached out to his group, Equality Utah, for help in advancing their own prohibitions. \u201cEveryone in red states is now saying, \u2018If Utah can do it, so can we!\u2019\u201d Williams wrote in a text message. \u201cWe are hopeful that Utah will again inspire the rest of the country.\u201d",
