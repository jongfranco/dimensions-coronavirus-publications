In order to gain more insight into the molecular epidemiology of IBV in Poland, in the present study the S1 coding region of 34 IBV isolates and nearly whole genome of 10 strains collected over a period of 38 years was characterized.

Additionally, two strains from 1989 and 1997 formed a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree categorized as unique early Polish variants, and one strain was revealed to be the recombinant of these and GI-1 lineage viruses. Irrespective of year of isolation and S1-dependent genotype, the genome sequences of Polish IBV strains showed the presence of six genes and 13 ORFs: 5\u2032UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3\u2032UTR, however their individual genes and putative proteins had different lengths. The phylogenetic analyses performed on the genome of ten Polish IBV strains revealed that they cluster into different groups. The Polish GI-1, GI-19 and GI-23 strains cluster with other similar viruses of these lineages, with the exception of the two strains from 1989 and 1997 which are different.
