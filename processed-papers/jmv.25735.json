        "abstract": "Objective: We aim to summarize reliable evidences of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection were collected for Meta-analysis. Results: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with 2019nCoV infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 89.1%, the incidence of cough was 72.2%, and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 42.5%. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 96.6%, the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 4.3%.",

        "4 Discussion": [
            "2019-nCoV is one type of coronaviruses which belongs to \u03b2-coronavirus cluster. It causes the third kind of zoonotic coronavirus disease after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Wei Ji et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] found that 2019-nCoV seemed to be a recombinant virus between bat coronavirus and coronavirus of another unknown origin. Kangpeng Xiao et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] confirmed that malayan pangolins were the most likely intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. The research of Domenico Benvenuto et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] found that 2019-nCoV was only closely related to the coronavirus isolated from chrysanthemum-headed bat in 2015. Their research suggests that bats may be the reservoir host for 2019-nCoV. According to the research by Peng Zhou et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] and Fan Wu et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], it was found that the sequence homology between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV was 79.5%. The homology between 2019-nCoV and bat coronavirus at the genetic level was 96%. Therefore, very likely it can be confirmed that 2019-nCoV comes from bats.",
            "According to the results of Meta-analysis, we find that the most common symptoms of patients with 2019nCoV infection were fever and cough, and most of the patients had abnormal chest CT. Some patients with 2019-nCoV infection had muscle soreness or fatigue, ARDS, and other symptoms. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms only occurred among a small number of patients. The proportion of severe cases in all infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate was 4.3%. At present, the Chinese government has announced that the case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection in China is 3.36%, which is lower than that of another two widely contagious zoonotic coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS. Infection mortality rates of SARS and MERS are 9.6% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] and 35% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], respectively. Gaohong Sheng et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] have shown that viral infection could increase the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Xie et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] found that 45% of patients showed signs of pulmonary fibrosis within one month after being infected with SARS-CoV. Hui et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] revealed that 36% and 30% of patients infected with SARS-CoV developed pulmonary fibrosis 3 and 6 months after infection. These studies consistently suggest that pulmonary fibrosis will become one of the serious complications in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. How to prevent and reduce the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with 2019-nCoV infection are urgent problems for medical workers in the treatment of 2019-nCoV. Yu Zhao et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] found that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was the receptor of 2019-nCoV. In normal lung tissue, ACE2 is mainly expressed by type Iand type IIalveolar epithelial cells. It was reported that 83% of II-type alveolar cells expressed ACE2. Therefore, 2019-nCoV infection causes damages to most II type alveolar cells. In addition, the use of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of patients with 2019 nCoV infection can also aggravate the injury of alveolar cells. After alveolar cell injury, transfor ming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF- \u03b2) released in tissue promotes the lung repair. Virus infection often leads to excessive activation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, which leads to the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis. Based on the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis after virus infection, we can formulate corresponding prevention and treatment proposals. The first is the treatment of 2019-nCoV infection. At present, a variety of drugs have been found to inhibit 2019-nCoV. Michelle L. Holshue et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] achieved remarkable results in the treatment of patients with 2019-nCoV infection with remdesivir. This drug is currently in clinical trials. Second, it is necessary to inhibit the inflammatory reaction and reduce the exudation. On this direction, antibiotics not only have traditional antibacterial effects, but also have immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory properties [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin, azithromycin, and erythromycin prevent the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune mediators [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. The third is to inhibit the fibrogenic effect of TGF-\u03b2. Luo et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] found that arsenic trioxide could inhibit the signal transduction of TGF-\u03b2 and play a role in anti-fibrosis. The fourth is the rational use of ventilator to avoid unnecessary lung damages. In addition, pirfenidone and nintedanib as drugs for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can also be used to prevent and treat pulmonary fibrosis in patients with 2019 -nCoV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. In all, a total of 10 articles were covered in the Meta-analysis, including 50466 patients with 2019-nCoV infection. By far, it is the first Meta-analysis with the largest sample size. The quality of the literature included in this study is high, the analysis is rigorous, and the conclusions drawn by the st udy are highly credible. However, this Meta-analysis also has some limitations: 1) All studies included in this Meta-analysis are retrospective studies with large heterogeneity; 2) Most patients in our Meta-analysis are Chinese, and we aimed to use the conclusions of this study to predict patients in general, including other countries and races; 3) There was publication bias in the Meta-analysis of the ARDS group. The analytical conclusion of the ARDS group may be influenced by publication bias. 4) The study subjects were inpatients who have been diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection. So the incidence of severe pneumonia or the fatality rate in the total population infected with 2019-nCoV would be much lower than the results shown in this study. Therefore, based on the above limitations, the conclusions of this Meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.
