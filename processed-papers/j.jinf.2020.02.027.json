            "To summarize, this study confirmed the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with other beta coronaviruses on the amino acid level. The hyper-variable genomic hotspot has been established in the SARS-CoV-2 population at the nucleotide but not the amino acid level, suggesting that there have been no beneficial mutations. The mutations in nsp1, nsp3, nsp15, and gene S that identified in this study would be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and was worthy of further study.
