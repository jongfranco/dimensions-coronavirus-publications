            "We have developed a model of the COVID-19 epidemic in China that incorporates key features of this epidemic: (1) the importance of the timing and magnitude of the implementation of major government public restrictions designed to mitigate the severity of the epidemic; (2) the importance of both reported and unreported cases in interpreting the number of reported cases; and (3) the importance of asymptomatic infectious cases in the disease transmission. In our model formulation, we divide infectious individuals into asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals. The symptomatic infectious phase is also divided into reported and unreported cases. Our model formulation is based on our work [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], in which we developed a method to estimate epidemic parameters at an early stage of an epidemic, when the number of cumulative cases grows exponentially. The general method in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], was applied to the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China, to identify the constant transmission rate corresponding to the early exponential growth phase.",

It is evident, that control of a COVID-19 epidemic is very dependent on an early implementation and a high level of restrictions on public functions.",

We showed that if this fraction is higher, then a significant increase in the number of total cases results. If it is lower, then a significant reduction occurs. It is evident, that control of a COVID-19 epidemic is very dependent on identifying and isolating symptomatic unreported infectious cases. We also decreased the parameter \u03bd (the reciprocal of the average period of asymptomatic infectiousness), and showed that the total number of cases in smaller. It is also possible to decrease \u03b7 (the reciprocal of the average period of unreported symptomatic infectiousness), to obtain a similar result. It is evident that understanding of these periods of infectiousness is important in understanding the total number of epidemic cases.",
