            "Biodiversity is rarely allowed to stop or delay a new airport runway or power plant.\u201d",
            "headline ambition to slow and eventually reverse the loss of biological diversity around the world.",
            "The Aichi targets failed, in part, because their format makes progress hard to measure. Ahead of this year\u2019s talks, a group of researchers led by Elizabeth Green at the Centre for Conservation Science in Sandy, UK, scanned the literature for mentions of the Aichi targets since 2010. The team then invited an expert group to score the targets on a scale of one to ten. All of the targets scored highly for being comprehensive, but most scored relatively poorly on being measurable and realistic (E. J. Green et. al. Conserv. Biol. 33, 1360\u20131369; 2019).",
            "Take the first target, intended to ensure that \u201cpeople are aware of the values of biodiversity and the steps they can take to conserve and use it sustainably\u201d. It\u2019s clear this aims to raise public awareness of and engagement with biodiversity, but it\u2019s not clear when success has been achieved.",
            "Those drawing up a new generation of biodiversity goals and targets understand this. The text of a new draft released last month contains spaces in square brackets, ready to be filled in when more-quantitative measures are agreed. Such measures include ensuring strict protection for important ecosystems and finding nature-based solutions that increase resilience to natural disasters (see Comment page 360)."
        ],
        "Ambition versus achievement": [
            "The Aichi targets didn\u2019t fail solely because they weren\u2019t measurable. They also failed because countries did not need to report what they were doing to achieve them.",
            "The biodiversity convention\u2019s member states have to publish biodiversity action plans \u2014 but these are often statements of a country\u2019s ambitions, rather than records of its achievements. For the next set of goals this has to change, and fortunately there seems to be a way forward. This is the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA), a mechanism for reporting environmental data, and it needs to become the global standard for environmental reporting.",
            "SEEA was adopted in 2012 to encourage countries\u2019 national statistical offices to take responsibility for collecting and reporting environmental data. Asking statistics offices to do this was a stroke of genius. These offices are already responsible for reporting national economic data to the UN. They work to the best available standards and strict deadlines \u2014 and they get the job done. Charging them with reporting environmental data ensured that these data would be treated in the same way.",
            "What began as a trickle of countries following the system has surged to more than 80 states sending updates to the UN on a multitude of environmental indicators, from the state of their forests to the state of their fisheries. Developing countries will need to be supported to get up to speed and contribute their own ideas. But the die is cast.",
            "As is sometimes the case with the UN, a lack of joined-up thinking allowed SEEA to emerge independently of other indicators, such as the Aichi targets and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Now, moves are under way towards some harmonization. Last July, the UN published a global indicator review (go.nature.com/2ssazbc) in which",
            "\u00a9 2 0 2 0 S p ri ngerNatureLim it e d . A ll ri ghtsreserved .",
            "Editorials researchers confirmed that countries could use SEEA to report 34 of the 147 Aichi target indicators and 21 of the 230 SDG target indicators. This is an important start, but also indicates how much needs to be done before more goals and targets can be reported using the SEEA framework \u2014 an opportunity which researchers must not pass up.",
            "Measuring and reporting numerical targets, although vital, is not the whole story. If the world is to understand why the Aichi targets failed \u2014 and improve on them \u2014 it must assess the broader obstacles.",
            "One is the historical tension between development and the environment \u2014 and the expectation of poorer countries that they should be able to develop, just as richer countries did. There is also a perception that new environmental standards will hold them back. No one can contest their case for developing, but, considering the state of the planet, their concerns need to be met through greener development. They need support to provide their citizens with basic amenities \u2014 such as clean water, nutrition and power \u2014 in a way that is sustainable and protects future generations. This means making significant changes to how economic decisions are made."
        ],
        "No contest": [
            "Usually, in any contest between industrial growth and the preservation of species and ecosystems, growth comes out on top. Biodiversity is rarely allowed to stop or delay a new airport runway or power plant. If a wetland needs to be concreted over to make way for a housing development, in many countries it has little chance of being protected, even though losing the wetland means sacrificing the services it provides to people \u2014 such as wildlife habitats and flood defences. These services are rarely quantified.",
            "Fortunately, researchers and policymakers globally are taking a stronger interest in valuing biodiversity\u2019s contribution to economies and to societies. IPBES is deep in a project that will advise countries on the many ways to value biodiversity; a report is due to be presented next year. And last year, the UK Treasury launched its own independent review, chaired by the economist Partha Dasgupta of the University of Cambridge, that is due to report in time for the biodiversity conference in China.",
            "We know that working in an economic and financial system that places little value on the natural world will make it difficult to meet goals in biodiversity and sustainable development. That\u2019s why it is prudent to tackle smaller aspects of the system \u2014 at least for now. At the same time, it\u2019s imperative that the new biodiversity goals find synergies and avoid conflicts with the Paris climate agreement and the SDGs, neither of which existed a decade ago.",
            "The road to the Kunming convention will be long and complicated. This is inevitable, both because life on Earth is itself beautifully complex, with so many global systems influencing biodiversity, and because the outcomes matter. Humanity\u2019s future depends on our ability to protect the planet. Greater awareness of threats to the natural world \u2014 perhaps an intangible impact of the Aichi targets \u2014 has created a moment ripe for action. The challenge will be to keep the devil in the detail from derailing the process itself."

        "The final countdown": [
            "The United Kingdom\u2019s Research Excellence Framework might turn out to be the last.",
            "It was the day most UK academics were dreading. On Monday 17 February, funding agencies fired the starting gun on the next Research Excellence Framework (REF 2021), the United Kingdom\u2019s system for evaluating research quality. Universities have until 27 November to submit their researchers\u2019 outputs to the REF. These will then be graded by review panels on a scale of 1 to 4 \u2014 the highest score meaning that the work is deemed \u201cworld leading\u201d in its originality, significance and rigour. A lot is riding on the outcome because funders use the results to allocate around \u00a32 billion (US$2.6 billion) in annual research funding to university departments. Most institutions will want to see their academics graded in the top two bands, because lower-performing departments are unlikely to get much money at all. The exercise is valuable in providing public accountability for research spending while protecting universities\u2019 financial autonomy. But many researchers and research managers are wondering whether REF 2021 could be the last. Many would not mourn the REF\u2019s demise. By coincidence, from 20 February thousands of UK academics will be on strike for 14 days, calling for better pay and more-secure pensions. The constant monitoring of performance that comes with research evaluation is also mentioned by academics as a source of stress and anxiety. The REF is also not cheap to administer \u2014 the 2014 exercise cost around \u00a3246 million. And as with most indices, the REF\u2019s overlords keep having to make changes to prevent it from being gamed. In the past, departments were able to achieve high scores by submitting outputs from a fraction of their best-performing staff \u2014 something that is no longer allowed. Universities that obtain the most REF-based funding are concentrated in London and southeast England, and this has fuelled arguments that the metric\u2019s funding formula helps to reinforce the UK\u2019s regional imbalance. That alone could be an argument for radical reform from a government looking to level up funding to other parts of the United Kingdom. That said, the REF\u2019s critics need to be careful what they wish for, because the framework protects money that universities rely on to pay salaries andto keep the lights on. The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also looking to cut funding from publicly funded bodies that have operated largely autonomously from the state \u2014 including the national broadcaster, the BBC. Moreover, proposals for research funding reforms are widely expected this year. A bonfire of the REF might well appeal to many, but not if the outcome leads to cuts, or reduced autonomy for institutions. There could be a wiser option: adjust the REF\u2019s funding formula so that money for the best work is distributed more fairly across the United Kingdom."
