        "abstract": "Vaccination is an effective method to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. In this paper, we develop an SIVS epidemic model with degree-related transmission rates and imperfect vaccination on scalefree networks. Firstly, we derive two threshold parameters and existence conditions of multiple endemic equilibria. Secondly, not only the global asymptotical stability of disease-free equilibrium and the persistence of the disease are derived, but also the global attractivity of the unique endemic equilibrium is proved using the monotone iterative technique. Thirdly, the effects of various immunization schemes including uniform immunization, targeted immunization and acquaintance immunization are studied, and the optimal vaccination strategy is analyzed by Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify these theoretical results.",

Notable viral emergence events include the 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza, the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERSCoV) in the Arabian peninsula, the West African Ebola outbreak, and ZIKV\u2019s invasion of the Americas [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. In the largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus in humans, 28625 cases were confirmed and 11325 died [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. As of February 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Therefore, it is very important to prevent and control the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases.<br/><br/>Vaccination is one of the most effective public policies to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Since Kermack and Mckendrick established the Susceptible Infected Removed (SIR) model of plague in 1927 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and Susceptible Infected Susceptible (SIS) model in 1932 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], respectively, more and more epidemic models of infectious diseases with vaccination have largely focused on the standard SIS model. In 2000, Kribs-Zaleta and Velasco-Hern\u00e1ndez [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] put forward an SIVS model with multiple endemic states which exhibited a backward bifurcation for some parameter values and presented a complete analysis of its behavior. Thereafter, many researchers considered various cases based on this model, such as nonlinear incidence rate [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], age of vaccination [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], spatial dispersal of individuals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], and state-dependent pulse vaccination [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. However, the basic assumption for the above works is that individuals in each compartment are homogeneously mixed. There are a few developments on the case of heterogeneously mixed. In 2013, Peng et al extended the SIVS model to Watts\u2013Strogatz small world, Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert scale-free, and random scale-free networks and made numerical analysis in detail [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. In 2016, Peng et al studied the combination of human behavior and demographics and put forward adaptive SIVS models on networks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. But the dynamic analysis and control strategy were excluded from these works. Recently, Chen et al added the quarantined compartment to the SIVS model on scale-free networks and presented the global dynamics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]."

            "The purpose of this paper is to study the global dynamics and control strategies of a newly proposed SIVS epidemic model on scale-free networks. We analytically derive the expressions of the epidemic threshold parameters R0 and R0. And we show that when R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium of system (1) is globally asymptotically stable, i.e., the disease will die out; when R0 > 1, there is a unique endemic equilibrium and the disease will persist on networks. For the four control schemes, we conclude that the targeted immunization method is the most effective among the first three schemes under some condition and present the numerical bounds of Dk : Wk for different cases.<br/><br/>In the current work, we only discuss the global dynamics of the endemic equilibrium P\u2217 for R0 > 1. However, there exist other endemic equilibria Pi\u2217(i ="
