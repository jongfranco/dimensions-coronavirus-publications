Using publicly available data regarding the transmissibility potential (i.e. basic reproduction number) of 2019\u2013nCoV, we demonstrate that relevant preprint studies generated considerable search and news media interest prior to the publication of peer-reviewed studies in the same topic area. We then show that preprint estimate ranges for the basic reproduction number associated with 2019\u2013nCoV overlap with those presented by peer-reviewed studies that were published at a later date. Taken together, we argue that preprints are capable of driving global discourse during public health crises; however, we recommend that a consensus-based approach \u2013 as we have employed here \u2013 be considered as a means of assessing the robustness of preprint findings prior to peer review.",
