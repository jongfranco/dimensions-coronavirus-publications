There are three outputs within which are given as and nine pairs of outputs within which are given as where the pair for represents the respondents response on presence or absence of sign and symptom and duration of corresponding sign and symptom (i) If the set of identifiers, , for is equal to one of the elements of the set , for for a respondent, then, send HCRC or MHCRC. If is not equal to any of the elements of the set then proceed to test criteria (iii). (ii) If the set of identifiers, , for is equal to one of the elements of the set then send HCRC or MHCRC to that respondent, else proceed to the test criteria (iv).

As we are focusing, in this note, only identification of cases, further analysis techniques are out of the scope. However, our approach is flexible to capture various other associations within the populations.",

Responses are randomly associated and not depended on the sickness due to the virus. The pair gives us the proportions who have responded and not responded in that region. Note that we can compute because the value is known to us in that region. Let out of are possible cases identified through our algorithm and out of are possible cases of the virus which were never identified by the algorithm (because number of individuals never responded to the survey).

            "Emerging and novel pathogens are a significant problem for global public health and technology can assist in faster identification of possible cases to bring timely interventions. This is especially true for viral diseases that are easily and readily transmissible and have asymptomatic infectivity periods. The novel Coronavirus (SARSCoV2) described in December 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in major quarantines throughout the world, including major cites, villages and public areas throughout China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] to prevent further spread. As of February 25th 2020, the World Health Organization\u2019s situational data indicates that there were about 77780 confirmed cases, including 2666 deaths due to COVID-19, including cases in 25 countries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. The majority of the deaths reported so far have been in China only [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization have issued interim guidelines in order to protect the population, and to attempt to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 from infected individuals[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Since cities and villages throughout China are unable to accommodate such large numbers of infected individuals, and be able to maintain the quarantined. China has built several new hospitals in an attempt to manage the infected individuals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. It is imperative that we evaluate novel models in an attempt to control the rapidly spreading virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "In order to reduce the time to identification of a person under investigation (PUI) for the COVID-19 infection, and the rapid isolation of this individual, we propose to collect the basic travel history along with the more common manifestations using a phone-based online survey. Such collected data can be used to assist in the preliminary screening and early identification of possible COVID-19 infected individuals. Thousands of data points are able to be collected and processed through an artificial intelligence (AI) framework which can ultimately evaluate individuals that may be infected and stratify them into no-risk, minimal-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk of being infected with the virus. The identification of the high-risk cases can then be quarantined earlier, thus decreasing the chance of spread."

As we are focusing, in this note, only identification of cases, further analysis techniques are out of the scope. However, our approach is flexible to capture various other associations within the populations.",

Responses are randomly associated and not depended on the sickness due to the virus. The pair gives us the proportions who have responded and not responded in that region. Note that we can compute because the value is known to us in that region. Let out of are possible cases identified through our algorithm and out of are possible cases of the virus which were never identified by the algorithm (because number of individuals never responded to the survey). Since and are known to us, one of the following relations will hold: We will know which one of the relations listed in (A2.1) is true. When the following relations will hold:",

If there are 100 possible cases of virus (which we do not have a mechanism to count) out of 500 who never responded, then the relation is true. Similarly, we will see other relations of (A2.2) could arise when",
