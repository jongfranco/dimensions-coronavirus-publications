In the process of dealing with group crisis intervention, various forms of psychosocial intervention services have been developed, including the intervention model of expert-coach-teacher collaboration after the Wenchuan earthquake[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] and the equilibrium psychological intervention on people injured in the disaster incident after the Lushan earthquake.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] With the support for remote psychological intervention provided by the development of Internet technology, especially the widespread application of 4G or 5G networks and smartphones, we developed a new intervention model to handle the present COVID-19 public health event. This new model, one of West China Hospital, integrates physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers into Internet platforms.",
            "We propose that the psychological crisis intervention should be dynamic, adapted to suit different stages of the epidemic, i.e., during and after the outbreak. During the outbreak, mental health professionals should actively participate in the overall intervention process for the disease, so that the mental health and psychosocial response can be mobilized in a timely fashion.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Specifically, psychological crisis interventions should be integrated into the treatment of pneumonia and blocking of the transmission routes. In this stage, psychological crisis intervention should include two simultaneous activities: (1) intervention for fear of disease, carried out mainly by physicians and assisted by psychologists; (2) intervention for difficulty in adaptation, mainly by social psychologists. Among them serious mental problems (e.g. violence, suicide behaviors) must be managed by psychiatrists. Such emotion hypothetical model of psychological crisis intervention is shown in Fig. 1.",
            "During the epidemic, rapid integration of the government and social forces into the Internet framework can maximize effective management of the psychological crisis. We established a pyramid structure of psychological crisis management with government",
            "as the core leader. At the bottom of the pyramid are communities, which mainly provide psychosocial support. Psychological assistance (such as hotline, online consulting) is used to identify and help the target groups who need intervention. Through the Huayitong app and Psyclub applet (two integrated APPs for online registration, appointment, payment and other functions for West China Hospital and Sichuan psychological consultant platform), telephone hotline and WeChat platform, we quickly organized physicians at all levels of the West China Hospital (including retired professors) and psychologists from all over Sichuan Province to form psychological rescue teams to formulate solutions (e.g. developing technical guidelines and training programs, starting online consultation and setting up problem feedback mechanisms). Psychological rescue teams conduct crisis interventions for confirmed patients and front-line staff. The expert team at the top of the pyramid",
