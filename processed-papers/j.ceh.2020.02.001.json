It can be applied for the prevention and control of SARI (severe acute respiratory infection). By combining sensors, information technology, artificial intelligence, and available dynamic networking devices, IoT could realize long-distance communication between hospitals, patients, and medical devices, which could ultimately improve current medical conditions.",
