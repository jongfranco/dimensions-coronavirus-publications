            "In conclusion, influenza infections were associated with seasonal and severe disease, occurred more commonly in older patients, and usually, in a non-immunized population. The influenza treatment rates should be increased and treatment should be initiated earlier, especially in critically ill patients. An increased frequency of influenza B infections occurred in 2013, probably due to a mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating lineage. Strengthening surveillance systems within institutions is important to rapidly identify the circulation of pathogens that present a risk to public health."

This kit enables the simultaneous detection of multiple RVs: human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, and PIV-4), influenza A (FLUA), influenza B (FLUB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-A, RSV-B), human rhinovirus type A and B (HRV A/B), human enterovirus, and human bocavirus, and human coronavirus type 229E/NL63 (alfa-coronaviruses) and OC43/HKU1 (beta-coronaviruses). Influenza A subtyping was performed using real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].

Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to assess differences between continuous variables with normal and asymmetric distributions, respectively. Fisher\u2019s exact and Pearson\u2019s chi-square tests were used to assess differences between categorical variables, as appropriate. Covariates were examined in univariate analysis to determine their association with influenza and other RV infections. Those with p<0.05 were included in the multivariate analysis. Using a stepwise conditional procedure, multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to identify independent predictors considering the presence of influenza or other RV infection as the endpoint. To verify the quality of the fit (goodness-of-fit), we used the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and qq-plot graph; both showed a good fit of the proposed model to the data.

Viral co-detection occurred in 127 cases (29% of positive samples); among the influenza virus infections, we found eight co-detections, mainly with HRV.

The median age differed significantly between influenza and ORV cases, at 5.4 and 0.7 years, respectively (Table 1). Influenza infection affected more patients aged 14-60 years, a population that remains susceptible to the virus, as the public health system provides the vaccine to children (<5 years), elderly (>60 years), health workers, and patients with comorbidities.

Even though influenza infections comprised only 10% of the total cases of RV detected in this study, these viruses represented 44% of all cases with myalgia. Furthermore, influenza infections tended to cause more severe disease, with more cases of SARI; however, this finding should be confirmed by prospective studies with higher numbers of patients. Of the 775 total cases in this study, 70% (535/775) were diagnosed with SARI and 57% (444/775) were virus-positive, 8% of which were positive for influenza (Table 2). Adjusted analysis showed that patients who were older, with SARI, and with myalgia had increased chances of positive results for influenza. Therefore, older patients with SARI diagnosis should be treated as having influenza infections until the laboratory investigation is completed.",

Most studies neglected the analysis of X-ray patterns in respiratory tract infections caused by influenza, which showed statistical relevance in this analysis.

However, unlike previous findings, no association was observed between influenza circulation and rainfall during the study period[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Studies on influenza seasonality in Brazil have shown distinct patterns of viral circulation; in the Northeast region, influenza circulates in the first 4 months of the year, overlapping with a period of higher humidity in that area[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].

In the Northeastern region, which has different climatic conditions, there was circulation of influenza A/H3N2 in the first 16 epidemiological weeks (EW) and then an increased detection of H1N1pdm between the 20th. and 30th EW, but with a lower intensity than occurred in the Southeastern and Southern regions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].

In both years, the predominant circulating lineage was Victoria-like, a variant different from that selected for vaccine composition (A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2, a virus similar to the B/Wisconsin/1/2010, Yamagata lineage10), highlighting the importance of updated information on circulating viruses to determine the vaccine composition. These findings emphasize the importance of public vaccination and studies on circulating virus strains.",

A prospective study involving a wider period of time would improve the analysis, allowing evaluation of the seasonality of influenza B cases.",
            "In conclusion, influenza infections were associated with seasonal and severe disease, occurred more commonly in older patients, and usually, in a non-immunized population. The influenza treatment rates should be increased and treatment should be initiated earlier, especially in critically ill patients. An increased frequency of influenza B infections occurred in 2013, probably due to a mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating lineage. Strengthening surveillance systems within institutions is important to rapidly identify the circulation of pathogens that present a risk to public health."
