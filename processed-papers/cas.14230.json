        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among women. Although endocrine therapy is effective, the development of endocrine resistance is a major clinical challenge. The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor malignancy, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) within the TME play a crucial role in endocrine resistance. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between TAM and the endocrine-resistant phenotype of breast cancer. Macrophages were cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from tamoxifen-sensitive (MCF7-S) or -resistant (MCF7-R) MCF7 breast cancer cells. M2 polarization was detected by CD163 immunofluorescence. To determine the effect on endocrine resistance, MCF7 cells were cultured in the supernatant of different TAM, and then treated with tamoxifen. CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) immunohistochemistry was carried out on pathological sections from 100 patients with invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. We found that macrophages cultured in the CM of MCF7-S and MCF7-R cells were induced into TAM, with a more obvious M2 polarization in the latter. Tamoxifen resistance was increased by culture in TAM medium. TAM secreted CCL2, which increased endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. High expression of CCL2 was correlated with infiltration of CD163+macrophages (r = 0.548, P < .001), and patients with high CCL2 expression presented shorter progression-free survival than those with low CCL2 expression (P < .05). We conclude that CCL2 secreted by TAM activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and promotes an endocrine resistance feedback loop in the TME, suggesting that CCL2 and TAM may be novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrineresistant breast cancer.",

            "In conclusion, our results indicate that endocrine-resistant tumor cells are more likely to promote M2 polarization of macrophages, whereas M2-polarized TAM further promote endocrine resistance in tumor cells, thus forming a positive feedback loop between TAM and breast cancer cells (Figure 5C). CCL2 plays an important role in this positive feedback loop. Increased CCL2 secretion by M2-polarized TAM activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in tumor cells to promote endocrine resistance and formation of the endocrine-resistant microenvironment by aggregating monocytes into the TME. These findings suggest that CCL2 and TAM may be potential novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrine-resistant breast cancer."

At present, most studies on the mechanism of endocrine resistance are focused on breast cancer cells, and only a few studies have focused on the role of other cells in the TME. TAM are an important component of the TME that play a role in angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor malignancy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>] Our previous studies have confirmed that TAM are correlated with tamoxifen resistance in patients with breast cancer.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying TAM-mediated endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells.<br/><br/>We showed that endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells can induce M2 polarization of TAM. M2-polarized TAM, in turn, promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. We found that breast cancer cells secrete trace amounts of TNF\u03b1 and promote autocrine secretion of TNF\u03b1 in macrophages, thereby activating the NF-\u03baB pathway and promoting CCL2 release. Endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells activate the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway of macrophages by altering amino acid metabolism in the environment, further promoting M2 polarization and CCL2 secretion by macrophages."

Slides were incubated with anti-CCL2 antibody (1:400 dilution; BioSource International) and anti-CD163 antibody (1:250 dilution; 10D6; Novocastra). Yellow granules indicated CCL2 positivity. CCL2 immunoreactivity was scored by staining intensity (negative, weak, moderate, or strong staining) and the percentage of positive tumor cells per core (\u226425%, >25%-50%, >50%-75%, and >75%). Tissues were considered positive for CCL2 expression with \u2265moderate staining intensity in >25% of the cells examined. Yellow granules indicated CD163 positivity. CD163 immunoreactivity was scored as the infiltration density of CD163+ macrophages ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (dense). A score equal to or greater than 1 was regarded as positive.",

            "THP-1 cells were first differentiated into macrophage (M\u03a6) by treatment with 320 nm PMA for 24 hours. Then, CM from tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 (MCF7-S) and tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 (MCF7-R) cells was added to M\u03a6 for another 24 hours of culture (Figure 1A). Finally, we obtained two types of TAM: TAM from a tamoxifen-sensitive TME (MS) and TAM from tamoxifen-resistant TME (MR).",
            "To examine the differences in the macrophages, cellular CD163 immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis were carried out on the M\u03a6, MS, and MR. CD163 is considered a polarization maker for TAM and M2. We found that CM from breast cancer cell lines increased CD163 expression in M\u03a6, indicating M2 polarization. CD163 expression was higher and M2 polarization was more significant in MR than in MS (Figure 1B,C). These observations indicate that macrophages can be polarized to assume different phenotypes in different microenvironments.",
            "3.2 | Conditioned medium from M2-polarized macrophages induces MCF7 tamoxifen resistance",
            "To investigate the function of macrophages of different phenotypes, supernatants of M\u03a6 and tumor-related macrophages, MS and MR, were added to tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 cells for 24 hours to obtain MCF7(M\u03a6), MCF7(MS), and MCF7(MR) cells (Figure 1D). The cells were then treated with 5 \u03bcmol/L tamoxifen. Apoptotic flow cytometry analysis was carried out and cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay (Figure 1E,F). Significant resistance to tamoxifen was observed in MCF7 cells cultured in CM of TAM (MS, MR), with MCF7(MR) being the most tamoxifen resistant. Thus, we conclude that the increased M2 polarization of TAM increased their ability to resist apoptosis and promote endocrine resistance. Endocrine-resistant cancer cells promote M2 polarization of macrophages, which, in turn, promotes endocrineresistance in cancer cells.",
            "We hypothesize that the different abilities of TAM to promote endocrine resistance is due to the different levels of secreted cytokines. After reviewing the relevant literature, we selected seven cytokines (CXCL-1, CCL2, CCL5, interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL17, and CXCL-5) that may promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>] Transcription of these seven cytokines in the three macrophages (M\u03a6, MS, and MR) was assessed by RT-PCR to identify the cytokines whose transcription levels were consistent with the trends from the CCK-8 and apoptotic flow cytometry assays. Only CCL2 was consistent with the previous results and the difference was statistically significant (Figure 2A). IL-6 also has the ability to promote endocrine resistance, and the transcription in MS and MR is different. However, our results showed that the transcription of IL-6 in M\u03a6 and MS was not statistically significant. Secretion of IL-6 could not explain the difference between M\u03a6 and MS in promoting drug resistance of endocrine tumors. Therefore, IL-6 was not chosen as the main object of the present study. To exclude the effect of autocrine CCL2 from cancer cells, we measured CCL2 expression levels in MCF7-S and MCF7-R cells by ELISA, and did not detect significant levels. We then determined the CCL2 concentration in CM from the three macrophages. With M2 polarization of macrophages, the concentration of secreted CCL2 increased significantly. Concentration of CCL2 was positively correlated with the trend of endocrine resistance in MCF7 cells (Figure 2B). Thus, we conclude that CCL2 is associated with endocrine resistance promoted by TAM. Two hormone receptor-positive cell lines, MCF7 and T47D, were selected to test the effect of CCL2. We confirmed that CCR2, the receptor of CCL2, was expressed in both cell lines (Figure S1). CCL2 (100 nm/mL) was added to the two cell lines and the cells were cultured for 24 hours. Subsequently, tamoxifen (5 \u03bcmol/L) was added to all four groups (MCF7, MCF7+CCL2, T47D, and T47D+CCL2) and the cells were cultured for 24 hours. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay (Figure 2C,D). The four groups were also analyzed by flow cytometry to detect apoptosis (Figure 2E,F). We found that CCL2 promotes endocrine resistance and reduces apoptotic proportion in the two hormone receptor-positive cell lines.",
            "3.4 | CCL2 inhibits apoptosis and increases endocrine resistance by activating the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR pathway",
            "We have shown that CCL2 is associated with endocrine resistance in MCF7 and T47D cell lines. As the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is a classic pathway regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and endocrine resistance, we investigated the effect of CCL2 on the activation of this pathway. When MCF7 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L CCL2, phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR was significantly increased. Adding CM of MR to MCF7 cells also activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. When MR was treated with 300 nmol/L Bindarit (a CCL2 synthesis inhibitor), the ability of the CM (MR + Bindarit) to increase the levels of phosphorylated Akt and mTOR was weakened (Figure 2G). These results suggest that TAM promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells partly by secreting CCL2, which then activates the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR pathway.",

            "CCL2 secretion has been thought to be dependent on the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which is activated by TNF\u03b1 in TME.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] We tested whether breast cancer cells and macrophages produce TNF\u03b1 by ELISA of CM(MCF7-S), CM(MCF7-R), CM(M\u03a6), CM(MS) and CM(MR). We found that MCF7-S and MCF7-R could secrete low concentrations of TNF\u03b1. The supernatant of breast cancer cells can promote autocrine secretion of TNF\u03b1 in macrophages. However, there was no significant difference in TNF\u03b1 level between CM(MS) and CM(MR), nor between CM(MCF7-S) and CM(MCF7-R) (Figure 3A). Further analysis of the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway in M\u03a6, MS, and MR showed that activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway in TAM was significant, but that activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway in MS and MR was not statistically significant (Figure 3B).

        "4 | DISCUSSION": [
            "Endocrine resistance in breast cancer is a major clinical challenge in treating patients with resistant disease. At present, most studies on the mechanism of endocrine resistance are focused on breast cancer cells, and only a few studies have focused on the role of other cells in the TME. TAM are an important component of the TME that play a role in angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor malignancy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>] Our previous studies have confirmed that TAM are correlated with tamoxifen resistance in patients with breast cancer.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying TAM-mediated endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells.",
            "We showed that endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells can induce M2 polarization of TAM. M2-polarized TAM, in turn, promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells. We found that breast cancer cells secrete trace amounts of TNF\u03b1 and promote autocrine secretion of TNF\u03b1 in macrophages, thereby activating the NF-\u03baB pathway and promoting CCL2 release. Endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells activate the mTORC1-FOXK1 pathway of macrophages by altering amino acid metabolism in the environment, further promoting M2 polarization and CCL2 secretion by macrophages.",
            "We also found that TAM promote endocrine resistance by secreting CCL2, which activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, CCL2 plays an important role in this malignant feedback loop. In addition, CCL2 promotes the aggregation of monocytes and macrophages in the TME.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>] The transition from monocytes to TAM further promotes the formation of the endocrine-resistant microenvironment. Analysis of tissue samples from patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer confirmed a correlation between high expression of CCL2 in the paraneoplastic stroma and infiltration of CD163+ macrophages. Moreover, patients with high CCL2 expression in the stroma had a shorter PFS after endocrine therapy. This is consistent with the findings of our previous study that patients with high CD163+ macrophage infiltration tend to develop endocrine resistance.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] The finding that CCL2 promotes the formation of the TME and the malignant cycle of cells in the TME may partly explain why patients with endocrine resistance in the past are more likely to be resistant to new endocrine therapy.",
            "Tumor-associated macrophages can adjust their phenotype and function in response to local cues provided by the TME.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>] Crosstalk between TAM and cancer cells is complex and involves exosomes, cytokines, and metabolites.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>] In the present study, we focused on the cytokine CCL2 secreted by macrophages and examined its role in the endocrine resistance of breast cancer cells. We found that CCL2 activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is a classical endocrine resistance pathway. However, the direct mechanism by which CCL2 activates this pathway was not determined. Another limitation of the present study was that due to the long culture time of drug-resistant cell lines, the effects of endocrine-resistant and -sensitive T47D cell lines on macrophages could not be repeated.",
            "Cell components in the TME are complex. In addition to TAM, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, epithelial cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes can also be tamed by tumor cells and promote a tumor malignant environment.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>] It has been reported that dendritic cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells tamed by cancer cells secrete CCL2.55-58 These cells can also contribute to the positive feedback loop. However, there are only a few studies on the role of these cells in the endocrine resistance of breast cancer, and there is no report on the effect of endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells on the differentiation of these cells. Future research should focus on the effect of other cell components in the TME on the endocrine resistance of breast cancer.",
            "In conclusion, our results indicate that endocrine-resistant tumor cells are more likely to promote M2 polarization of macrophages, whereas M2-polarized TAM further promote endocrine resistance in tumor cells, thus forming a positive feedback loop between TAM and breast cancer cells (Figure 5C). CCL2 plays an important role in this positive feedback loop. Increased CCL2 secretion by M2-polarized TAM activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in tumor cells to promote endocrine resistance and formation of the endocrine-resistant microenvironment by aggregating monocytes into the TME. These findings suggest that CCL2 and TAM may be potential novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrine-resistant breast cancer."
