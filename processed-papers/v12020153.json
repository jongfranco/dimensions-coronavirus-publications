        "abstract": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has recently estimated that the world equid population exceeds 110 million (FAOSTAT 2017). Working equids (horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules) remain essential to ensure the livelihood of poor communities around the world. In many developed countries, the equine industry has a significant economical weight, with around 7 million horses in Europe alone. The close relationship between humans and equids, and the fact that the athlete horse is the terrestrial mammal that travels the most worldwide after humans, are important elements to consider in the transmission of pathogens and diseases, amongst equids and to other species. The potential effect of climate change on vector ecology and vector-borne diseases is also of concern for both human and animal health.",

            "With this Special Issue, which assembles a collection of communications, research articles, and reviews, we intend to explore our understanding of a panel of equine viruses, looking at their pathogenicity, their importance in terms of welfare and potential association with diseases, their economic importance and impact on performance, and how their identification can be helped by new technologies and methods. Beyond their potential risk to other species, including humans, equine viruses may also represent an interesting model for reproducing virus infection in the host species.",
            "Dennis et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] contributed a review on African Horse Sickness (AHS). This disease, caused by the orbivirus AHS virus (AHSV), induces a very high mortality rate that can exceed 95% in its most severe form. This disease mostly occurs in southern African countries, but its transmission by Culicoides biting midges is of great concern in the current context of global warming and its consequence on displacement of vector populations. In the absence of treatment, prevention is essential, and Dennis et al also provide a comprehensive review of the different vaccine strategies and technologies available and in current development against AHSV. While live attenuated and inactivated AHSV vaccines have played a role to reduce the impact and occurrence of AHS in affected areas, the number of AHSV serotypes in circulation and their lack of DIVA markers (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) is a drawback that leads to the development of a new generation of vaccines, such as poxvirus-vectored or reverse genetics vaccines. Lecollinet et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] reviewed major viruses inducing encephalitis in equids and their growing importance as a threat to the European horse population. Amongst them, equid herpesviruses (EHVs) are some of the most frequently isolated equine viruses worldwide. The equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is of particular interest to the equine industry because of the different forms of disease it can induce, from a mild respiratory infection to abortion, neonatal death, and myeloencephalopathy (EHM) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. A communication from Preziuso et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] and an article from Sutton et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] specifically focused on EHV-1 strain characterization in order to better understand EHV circulation in Italy and France. Different approaches were compared, from the single-nucleotide point (SNP) mutation in ORF30 (historically associated with abortive or neuro-pathogenic strains), to other ORF gene sequences and the newly described multilocus strain typing methods (MLST; [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]). The MLST method is an interesting new approach for EHV-1 and a potential epidemiological tool"
