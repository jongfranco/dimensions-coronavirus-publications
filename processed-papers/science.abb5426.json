            "How feasible these kinds of stringent measures are in other countries is debatable. \u201cChina is unique in that it has a political system that can gain public compliance with extreme measures,\u201d Gostin says. \u201cBut its use of social control and intrusive surveillance are not a good model for other countries.\u201d The country also has an extraordinary ability to do labor-intensive, large-scale projects quickly, says Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development: \u201cNo one else in the world really can do what China just did.\u201d",
            "Nor should they, says lawyer Alexandra Phelan, a China specialist at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Global Health Science and Security. \u201cWhether it works is not the only measure of whether something is a good public health control measure,\u201d Phelan says. \u201cThere are plenty of things that would work to stop an outbreak that we would consider abhorrent in a just and free society.\u201d",
            "The report does mention some areas where China needs to improve, including the need \u201cto more clearly communicate key data and developments internationally.\u201d But it is mum on the coercive nature of its control measures and the toll they have exacted. \u201cThe one thing that\u2019s completely glossed over is the whole human rights dimension,\u201d says Devi Sridhar, an expert on global public health at the University of Edinburgh. Instead, the report praises the \u201cdeep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action in the face of this common threat.\u201d",
            "\u201cTo me, as somebody who has spent a lot of time in China, it comes across as incredibly na\u00efve\u2014and if not na\u00efve, then willfully blind to some of the approaches being taken,\u201d Phelan says. Singapore and Hong Kong may be better examples to follow, Konyndyk says: \u201cThere has been a similar degree of rigor and discipline but applied in a much less draconian manner.\u201d",
            "The report doesn\u2019t mention other downsides of China\u2019s strategy, says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, who wonders what impact it had on, say, the treatment of cancer or HIV patients. \u201cI think it\u2019s important when evaluating the impact of these approaches to consider secondary, tertiary consequences,\u201d Nuzzo says.",
            "And even China\u2019s massive efforts may still turn out to have only temporarily slowed the epidemic. \u201cThere\u2019s no question they suppressed the outbreak,\u201d says Mike Osterholm, head of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. \u201cThat\u2019s like suppressing a forest fire, but not putting it out. It\u2019ll come roaring right back.\u201d But that, too, may teach the world new lessons, Riley says. \u201cWe now have the opportunity to see how China manages a possible resurgence of COVID-19,\u201d he says.",
            "Aylward stresses that China\u2019s successes so far should give other countries confidence that they can get a jump on COVID-19. \u201cWe\u2019re getting new reports daily of new outbreaks in new areas, and people have a sense of, \u2018Oh, we can\u2019t do anything,\u2019 and people are arguing is it a pandemic or not,\u201d Aylward says. \u201cWell, sorry. There are really practical things you can do to be ready to be able to respond to this, and that\u2019s where the focus will need to be.\u201d"
