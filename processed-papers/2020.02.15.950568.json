        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health concern as it continues to spread within China and beyond. The causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus which also includes severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV). Codon usage of viral genes are believed to be subjected to different selection pressures in different host environments. Previous studies on codon usage of influenza A viruses can help identify viral host origins and evolution trends, however, similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking. In this study, global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group correspondence analysis (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) were performed among different genes in coronavirus viral sequences. The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs. However, we found greater synonymous codon usage differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures.",

This novel coronavirus outbreak had raised global concern but current knowledge on the origin and transmission route of the pathogen is still limited. The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.<br/><br/>Apart from human, many animal species, such as bat, rat, camel, swine and hedgehog, can be infected by different types of coronaviruses.

Viral sequences from 3 different species (Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV), Betacoronavirus 1, SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-<br/><br/>Cov)) were the three most dominant species (see Supplementary Figure S1) in the filtered dataset.<br/><br/>Four conserved protein sequence encoding regions of Betacoronavirus were analysed separately. The median lengths of the studied sequence regions were 21237 nt for orf1ab gene, 4062 nt for spike gene, 660 nt for membrane gene and 1242 nt for nucleocapsid gene.<br/><br/>Spike gene has the lowest average and median G + C contents among these four genes (median: 37.45%, 37.31%, 42.60% and 47.22% for orf1ab, spike, membrane and nucleocapsid respectively). The G +C contents of the orf1ab and spike genes were found distributed in bi-modal patterns, and the G + C contents of SARS-CoV-2 were found located at the lesser half of the data of these two genes. The G + C contents for membrane and nucleocapsid genes of studied viral sequences were distributed in unimodal pattern (see",

Specifically, we discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 had amino acid usage pattern most similar to bat RaTG13 virus, followed by pangolin P1E, bat CovVZC45 and bat CoVZXC21. The sequences of<br/><br/>BtKY72 and BM48-31 were from a more phylogenetically distant clade, and, accordingly, they had relatively distinct amino acid usage to SARS-CoV-2 as expected in all four studied genes. This result agrees with the result in the full-genome phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Figure S7).<br/><br/>The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 at synonymous codon usage level was marginal in orf1ab and nucleocapsid sequences. Interestingly, there were noticeable differences in the spike and membrane gene analyses. Our results suggest the synonymous codon usage patterns in the spike and membrane gene of SARS-CoV-2 are different from those of its genetically related viruses (i.e. RaTG13 and other reference relatives). For example, the synonymous codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closer to a cluster of rodent murine coronaviruses at the first two factorial levels (Figure 3A and Figure"

We observed that leucine and valine were the two most frequently used amino acids in the four studied genes, while tryptophan, histidine and methionine were the three least used ones. We also found that codons ending with cytosine or guanine were generally less frequent than the codons ending with adenine or thymine. This pattern of uneven usage in synonymous codons is in accordance with the G + C content distribution results (codons ending with guanine or cytosine were less frequently observed).<br/><br/>We found a substantial bias in amino acid usage among these four genes, and this bias is well explained by the hydropathy of the encoded proteins (results from global correspondence analysis on all the four genes, collectively, data not shown). The GRAVY scores for every sequence were calculated to represent the degree of hydropathy. We discovered that the nucleocapsid protein sequences had significantly lower GRAVY scores as compared to those from other genes, while the membrane protein sequences had highest GRAVY scores (see",

There are two levels of codon usage biases, one is at amino acid level and the other is at synonymous codon level. The amino acid composition of proteins can be an important factor that explaining certain sequence traits.

            "Results from the BCA suggested that the amino acid usage of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to bat and human SARSr-CoVs in all four genes (Figure 3B and Figure 4B).

            "BtKY72 and BM48-31 were from a more phylogenetically distant clade, and, accordingly, they had relatively distinct amino acid usage to SARS-CoV-2 as expected in all four studied genes. This result agrees with the result in the full-genome phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Figure S7).",
            "The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 at synonymous codon usage level was marginal in orf1ab and nucleocapsid sequences. Interestingly, there were noticeable differences in the spike and membrane gene analyses. Our results suggest the synonymous codon usage patterns in the spike and membrane gene of SARS-CoV-2 are different from those of its genetically related viruses (i.e. RaTG13 and other reference relatives). For example, the synonymous codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closer to a cluster of rodent murine coronaviruses at the first two factorial levels (Figure 3A and Figure",
            "4A).",
            "Further analysis on spike gene, however, suggested that the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 and rodent murine coronaviruses were distinct at the third factorial level (Supplementary Figure",

            "Figure S8A). It is evident that the synonymous codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is distinct from other bat origin coronaviruses. The difference in synonymous codon usage is largely explained by the first factor (more than 50%), and our analysis on codon usages suggest that the first factor maybe highly related to the preferential usage of codons ending with cytosine (Supplementary Figure S9). We also had similar observation for the membrane gene. Our three-dimensional analysis revealed that the synonymous codon usage of SARS-",

        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Codon usage can be affected by many sequence features, including nucleotide composition, dinucleotide composition, amino acid preference, host adaption, etc[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. The codon usages of viral sequences can vary by genes and host origins[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. The bias in codon usage is a unique and distinctive characteristic that can reflect the \u201csignature\u201d of a genomic sequence.",
            "Codon usage analyses are often complementary to ordinary sequence alignment-based analyses which focus on the genetic distance at nucleotide level, whereas codon usage analyses enable capturing signals at different sequence parameters. Therefore, codon usage bias can be another good proxy for identifying unique traits (e.g. virus origin, host origin, or some functions of proteins) of a genome. The goal of this study was to investigate the codon usage bias of betacoronaviruses. By studying the codon usags of these viruses in a systematic manner, we identified viral sequences carrying traits similar to those of SARS-CoV-2, which provided useful information for studying the host origin and evolutionary history of SARS-",
            "CoV-2.",
            "The codon usage of different genes in betacoronaviruses are very different. The G+C content, especially the GC3 content is known to be influential to the codon usage of some bacteria and viruses 7,24,25. The GC3 content has pronounced effects on our WCA analysis of the orf1ab and spike genes. The GC3 content was found correlated with high WCA values on the first factor of orf1ab (Supplementary Figure S9). By contrast, codons ending with cytosine had lower factorial values in the spike gene analysis (Supplementary Figure S9). The G + C contents in membrane and nucleocapsid genes were less suppressed (Supplementary Figure",
            "S2). This can be partly explained by the fact that membrane and nucleocapsid are two genes with shorter lengths which may limit the flexibilities for mutation or codon usage adaptation.",
            "In addition to global CA analysis, the application of WCA and BCA can eliminate the effects caused by amino acid compositions and synonymous codon usage, respectively. These alternative analytical tools were important to our study. It is because the amino acid sequences are expected to be more conserved such that they can preserve biological functions of the translated genes. By contrast, mutations at synonymous level tend to be more frequent, as most of these codon alternatives do not affect the biological function of a protein.",
            "Of all the existing genomes in the dataset, RaTG13 best matched the overall codon usage pattern of the SARS-CoV-2. Although the SARS-CoV-2 had amino acid usage similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs, the synonymous codon usages between them were relatively different, which indicates similar protein characteristics but maybe different evolutionary histories. The codon usage of bat coronaviruses are more scattered than coronaviruses of other hosts. This result agrees with the fact that bat is a major host reservoir of coronavirus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>], thus it harbours coronaviruses with more complex genomic backgrounds.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in human, but its codon usage pattern is very different from those of other human betacoroanviruses (Supplementary Figure S5A). In fact, the codon usage at both the amino acid level and synonymous level denote that the orf1ab gene in",
            "SARS-CoV-2 had closest relationship to SARSr-CoV, especially RaTG13. The CoVZX45 and CoVZXC21 had similar amino acid usage but relatively different synonymous codon usage to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3). Besides bat-origin SARSr-CoV, the pangolin P1E also had similar codon usage to SARS-CoV-2 both at amino acid and synonymous codon levels. The result in orf1ab is in accordance with the full-genome phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary",
            "Figure S7), showing a close relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 by the overall backbone of the genome.",
            "The S protein is responsible for receptor binding which is important for viral entry. The genetic variability is extreme in spike gene[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>], and this highly mutable gene may possess valuable information about recent evolution history. In our results, the synonymous codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in spike gene was distinct from those of RaTG13 and other phylogenetic relatives (Figure 3A), which was not observed in orf1ab or nucleocapsid gene.",
            "Although the codon usage in spike of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and P1E were similar at amino acid level, the difference at synonymous codon usage level indicates that they are unlikely to share a very recent common ancestor. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and P1E might have undergone different evolution pathways for a certain period of time. The amino acid usage of SARS-CoV-2 in membrane was clustered with bat SARSr-CoV, however the synonymous codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 was still distinct to these bat coronaviruses.",
            "Notably, in membrane gene, pangolin P1E had a more similar synonymous codon usage to",
            "SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13. These findings suggest that there may be different selection forces between genes. Our result supports different evolutionary background or currently unknown host adaption history in SARS-CoV-2. The codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in nucleocapsid gene was similar to bat SARSr-CoV both at amino acid level and synonymous level, suggesting that no highly significant mutation happened in this gene.",
            "Codon usage can be shaped by many different selection forces, including the influence from host factors. Some researchers have hypothesised that the codon usage in SARS-CoV-2 maybe directly correlated to the codon usage of its host[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. However our recent study on influenza A viruses implied that these may not be the most influential factors shaping the codon usage of a viral genome[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].
