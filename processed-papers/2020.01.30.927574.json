        "abstract": "SummaryCoronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3\u2019-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.",

            "One of the most important druggable targets is the RdRp. Example drugs include Gilead\u2019s sofosbuvir (which is paired with velpatasvir as the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA), to inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the hepatitis C virus. Sofosbuvir, a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue (Fig. 2) with a blocked phosphate group enabling it to enter infected eukaryotic cells, is a prodrug, which is converted into its active triphosphate form by cellular enzymes (Fig. 3). The activated drug binds in the active site of the RdRp, where it is incorporated into RNA, and due to modifications at the 2\u2019 position, inhibits further RNA chain extension and halts RNA replication. It acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor by competing with natural ribonucleotides.",

            "There are many other RNA polymerase inhibitor drugs which are used as antivirals. A related purine nucleotide prodrug, remdesivir (Fig. 4), was developed by Gilead to treat Ebola virus infections, though not very successfully, and is currently being considered for repositioning to treat the 2019-nCoV outbreak (https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gilead-mulls-repositioning-failed-ebola-drug-china-virus).",
            "In contrast to sofosbuvir, both the 2\u2019- and 3\u2019-OH groups are unmodified, but a cyano group at the 1\u2019 position presumably serves to inhibit the RdRp in the active triphosphate form.
