        "abstract": "The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over China and to more than 20 other countries. Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RTPCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients.",

            "The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over China and to more than 20 other countries. Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RTPCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients.",
            "We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories.",

Countrywide interventions include delaying resumption of workplaces, and encouraging citizens to stay and work from home, and so on.",
            "However, these efforts are limited by one hard problem: how to differentiate the COVID-19 cases from the healthy. For confirmed COVID-19 cases, reported the common clinical symptoms include fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Yet these symptoms are not unique features of COVID-19 because these symptoms are similar to that of other virusinfected disease such as influenza.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Currently, virus nucleic acid Real Time-PCR (RTPCR), CT imaging and some hematology parameters are the primary tools for clinical diagnosis of the infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Many laboratory test kits have been developed and used in testing patient specimens for COVID-19 by Chinese CDC, US CDC and other private companies. The virus nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become as the current standard diagnostic method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Yet these real-time PCR test kits suffer from many limitations: 1) These tests have long turnaround times and are complicated in operation; they generally take on average over 2 to 3 hours to generate results. 2) The PCR tests require certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained technicians to operate. 3) There are some numbers of false negatives for RT-PCR of COVID-19.11 These limitations make RT-PCR unsuitable for use in the field for rapid and simple diagnosis and screening of patients. It limits the outbreak containment effort. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a rapid, simple to use, sensitive, and accurate test to quickly identify infected patients of SARS-CoV-2 to prevent virus transmission and to assure timely treatment of patients.",
            "Testing of specific antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 in patient blood is a good choice for rapid, simple, highly sensitive diagnosis of COVID-19. It is widely accepted that IgM provides the first line of defense during viral infections, prior to the generation of adaptive, high affinity IgG responses that are important for long term immunity and immunological memory.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] It was reported that after SARS infection, IgM antibody could be detected in patient blood after 3 - 6 days and IgG could be detected after 8 days.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Since COVID-19 belongs to the same large family of viruses as those that cause the MERS and SARS outbreak, we assume its antibody generation process is similar, and detection of the IgG and IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2 will be an indication of infection. Furthermore, detection of IgM antibodies tends to indicate a recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2, whereas detection of COVID-19 IgG antibodies indicates virus exposure some time ago. Thus, we believe that detection of both IgM and IgG could provide information on virus infection time course. The rapid detection of both IgM and IgG antibodies will add value to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 disease.",
            "Based on these, we developed a point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test product, which can detect IgM and IgG simultaneously in human blood within 15 minutes. We tested the product in 8 hospitals and Chinese CDC agencies to validate its clinical efficacy. The results demonstrated this rapid antibody test has high sensitivity and specificity. It can be used in hospitals, clinics, and testing laboratories. The test can also be effectively deployed in businesses, schools, airports, seaports and train stations, etc., giving it the potential to become a compelling force in the fight against this global threat."

The mechanism of the assay is based on the hydration and transport of reagents as they interact with the specimen across the strip via chromatographic lateral flow (Figure 1 A). As the specimen flows through the device, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies, if present in the specimen, are bound by the SARS-CoV-2 antigen labeled gold colorimetric reagent fixed on the conjugate pad. As the conjugated sample continues to travel up the strip, the anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies are bound on the M(IgM) line, and the anti-COVID-19 IgG antibodies are bound to the G (IgG) line. If the specimen does not contain SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, no labeled complexes bind at the Test",

During the test, excess reagent including AuNP-rabbit IgG conjugates migrate passes the control line zone, where the AnNP-rabbit IgG conjugates binds to anti-rabbit IgG to form red line on the control line.

            "The detection sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM combined antibody kit",
            "In order to test the detection sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM combined antibody test, blood samples were collected from COVID-19 patients from multiple hospitals and Chinese CDC laboratories. The tests were done separately at each site. A total of 525 cases were tested: 397 (positive) clinically confirmed (including PCR test) SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and 128 non- SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (128 negative). The testing results of vein blood without viral inactivation were summarized in the Table 1. Of the 397 blood sample from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 352 tested positive, resulting in a sensitivity of 88.66%. 12 of the blood samples from the 128 nonSARS-CoV-2 infection patients tested positive, generating a specificity of 90.63%. It was also found that 64.48% (256 out of 397) of positive patients had both IgM and IgG antibodies (Table 1).",
            "For the test, it is very important to know the data of infection time point from clinical samples which will be helpful to compare the data of single or double positive in Table 1. Due to limited time, we do not have complete detailed information for how long each patient was infected or for how long each patient had symptoms when blood sample was collected at all the clinical sites. We only had such data from one of clinical site- Wuhan Red Cross Hospital. As a reference, by analyzing one subset data of 58 patients in Wuhan, it was found that 94.83% of the positive patients had both IgM and IgG positive test lines, and 1.72%, 3.45% had only IgM or only IgG positive lines respectively (table 2). The test time was at day 8 to day 33 after infection symptoms appeared. Further studies and information collection are needed for this.",
            "The above results have verified the sensitivity and specificity of kit detection in uninactivated vein blood. However, it is more convenient to collect fingerstick blood outside hospitals and clinics. In order to achieve a simpler operating process, we tested the performance of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM combined antibody kit with peripheral blood. Patient fingerstick blood and vein blood and plasma from the same patient were tested. As showed in the Table 3, seven COVID-19 patients and three healthy volunteers were recruited. We took the blood samples from fingerstick, serum of venous blood, and plasma of venous blood and tested them with the kits. Within the 7 patients, 3 patients have IgM only positive and 4 patients have both IgM and IgG positive. All healthy volunteers tested negative. The results showed that all of the positive and negative test results matched with 100% consistency among the corresponding blood samples. This result demonstrates that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM combined antibody test kit can be used as a point-of-care test (POCT). It can be performed near the bedside with fingerstick blood."

This test kit provides a product to meet the urgent need for immunoassay tests in Chinese hospitals for the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

It was also been confirmed that the detection sensibility was higher in IgG-IgM combined antibody test than in individual IgG or IgM antibody test (Table 1). Therefore, we more recommend the development of IgG-IgM combined antibody test kits than the separate IgG or IgM antibody test kits, if there is a reliable technical system available. It is a better test for screening COVID-19 patients.",
            "This new develop test kit, the IgG-IgM combined antibody test kit, has sensitivity of 88.66% and specificity of 90.63%. However, there were still false positive and false negative results (Table 1). The reasons for the false negative may be due, first, to low antibody concentrations. When IgM and IgG levels are below the detection limit (not determined yet) of this rapid test, the test results will be negative. Second, the difference in individual immune response antibody production could be one reason for the false negative results in COVID-19 patients. The last but not least, IgM antibody will decrease and disappear after 2 weeks. In some cases, it is hard to know exactly when the patient was infected or how long the patient was infected. Thus, when the patient was tested, the IgM level might well be below its peak and not detectable by this test. Therefore, we encourage more research and development of the COVID-19 IgG-IgM combined antibody test kit to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for patients. Since COVID-19 recombinant antigen was used in the test, our test is specific for COVID-19 infection. The clinical testing data in this paper at different clinical sites from east, south, west and middle of China confirmed the specificity of the test kit. However, because of the emergency of outbreak of COVID-19, we could not carry out normal research activities and perform enough tests to verify if there is interference from other IgM and IgG induced by different virus infections such as typical flu viruses. This work need be done later.",
            "This new rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM combined antibody test kit has several advantages. Compared to RT-PCR, it saves time and it does not require equipment, it is simple to perform and only requires minimal training. It can be performed at the bedside, in any clinic or laboratory, at airports or at railway stations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. It will be more convenient to use fingerstick blood or heel blood instead of vein blood for out-of-clinic screening. Our initial test results using fingertip blood were as good as that of vein blood (Table 3), which suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM combined antibody test kits can be developed as agents for rapid field detection. Another potential application of this test is screening asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, it was reported that asymptomatic carriers could spread SARS-CoV-2 virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] This finding made the current COVID-19 outbreak control more difficult, because there is no method available to screen asymptomatic carriers. This rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody test kit makes large scale screening of asymptomatic carriers possible. At least some if not all of the carriers are likely to have anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies, as demonstrated by asymptomatic Zika virus carriers.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] Because this test can detect IgM and IgG simultaneously, it could be used for both early diagnosis (IgM) and for monitoring during treatment. SARS-CoV-2 infection starts at the lungs, not in the upper respiratory tract,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] therefore, sampling during the early infection stage using throat swab or sputum may not detect the virus. This is one possible explanation for high false negatives in nucleic acid PCR test. However, this sampling effect should not have any effect on IgM and IgG detection with this rapid test.",
            "Based on our knowledge and information, there are several other Chinese IVD companies are developing or have developed similar products ranging from IgM only and IgM-IgG combined tests. We do not know the details about their technical performance since there is no publication on them. We believe the good test products will be used in clinical sites and the information will emerge. We will carry out comparison studies later.",
            "Certainly, this test cannot confirm virus presence, only provide evidence of recent infection, but it provides an important immunological evidence for physicians to make the correct diagnosis along with other tests and to start treatment of patients. In addition, possible cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and flu viruses were not studied, and the change level of antibody was not compared in the different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We believe the combination of nucleic acid RT-PCR and the IgM-IgG antibody test can provide more accurate SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis."
