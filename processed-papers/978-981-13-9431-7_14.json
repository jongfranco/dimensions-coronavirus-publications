        "abstract": "This chapter provides an overview, from bioeconomic and global sustainability perspectives, of the main constraints to the current global vaccine innovation system for achieving Sustainable Development Goals \u2013 SDGs. Biotechnology market trends, gaps in vaccine coverage against emerging and neglected diseases, and patent protection and regulation are discussed. A structured long-term \u201cpublic-return-driven\u201d innovation model to overcome vaccine market failure is proposed.\nUnited Nations (2014) Secretary General.
