        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The\nfamily of viruses belonging to Coronaviridae mainly consist of virulent\npathogens that have a zoonotic property, Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)\nand Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) of this family have emerged\nbefore and now the Novel COVID-19 has emerged in China. Characterization of spike\nglycoproteins, polyproteins and other viral proteins from viruses are important\nfor vaccine development. Homology modelling of these proteins with known\ntemplates offers the opportunity to discover ligand binding sites and possible\nantiviral properties of these protein ligand complexes. Any information emerging\nfrom these protein models can be used for vaccine development. In this study we\ndid a complete bioinformatic analysis, sequence alignment, comparison of\nmultiple sequences and homology modelling of the Novel COVID-19 whole genome\nsequences, the spike protein and the polyproteins for homology with known\nproteins, we also analysed receptor binding sites in these models for possible\nvaccine development. Our results showed that the tertiary structure of the polyprotein\nisolate COVID-19 _HKU-SZ-001_2020 had 98.94 percent identity with\nSARS-Coronavirus NSP12 bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors. Our results indicate\nthat a part of the viral genome (residues  \n254 to 13480 in  Frame 2 with  4409 amino acids) of  the Novel COVID-19  virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (Genbank Accession\nNumber MN908947.3)   when modelled with template  2a5i of the PDB database  had 96 percent identity with a 3C like\npeptidase of SARS-CoV which has ability to bind with Aza-Peptide Epoxide (APE)\nwhich is known for  irreversible\ninhibition of SARS-CoV main peptidase. The part of the genome when modelled\nwith template 3e9s of the PDB database had 82 percent identity with a papain-like\nprotease/deubiquitinase which when complexed with ligand GRL0617 acts as\ninhibitor which can block SARS-CoV replication. It is possible that these viral\ninhibiters can be used for vaccine development for the Novel COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

            "The family of viruses belonging to Coronaviridae mainly consist of virulent pathogens that have a zoonotic property, Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) of this family have emerged before and now the Novel COVID-19 has emerged in China.

Homology modelling of these proteins with known templates offers the opportunity to discover ligand binding sites and possible antiviral properties of these protein ligand complexes. Any information emerging from these protein models can be used for vaccine development. In this study we did a complete bioinformatic analysis, sequence alignment, comparison of multiple sequences and homology modelling of the Novel COVID-19 whole genome sequences, the spike protein and the polyproteins for homology with known proteins, we also analysed receptor binding sites in these models for possible vaccine development. Our results showed that the tertiary structure of the polyprotein isolate COVID-19 _HKU-SZ-001_2020 had 98.94 percent identity with SARS-Coronavirus NSP12 bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors.
