The seafood market which was thought to be the source was closed on 1 January 2020.2 The causative organism was identified on 7 January 2020 as a novel coronavirus (nCOV). The genetic sequence of at least 19 strains found in infected patients has been published so far.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] To date, COVID19 has already confirmed to have affected almost >68,000 with >1600 deaths in China, and over 680 cases outside of China spanning 25 countries over South East Asia, Europe, North America, Australia and the Middle East, etc. This number is expected to rise over the next few months worldwide. So far, 41 million from China and at least 14 cities in the Hubei province have travel restrictions, some with suspension of outbound flights and trains as well as other public transport, and many countries are taking measures to quarantine travellers from China.",

            "Comparisons are being made with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), also both caused by coronaviruses. SARS emerged in 2003 and caused the first pandemic of the 21st century, affecting more than 8000 people, killing 774 in 26 countries.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] MERS coronavirus (MERS-\u00adCoV) was isolated in 20126 and has seen over 2400 cases reported to WHO to date, and over 850 deaths.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Of the 2223 laboratory-\u00ad confirmed MERS-\u00adCoV cases reported to WHO, 415 were healthcare workers, representing over one-\u00adthird of all secondary transmission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] SARS and MERS spread principally by direct transmission and respiratory droplets.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] However, SARS-C\u00adoV, and perhaps also MERS-C\u00ad oV, may shed and be transferred to environmental surfaces, and thence contaminate hands and mucous membranes subsequently.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]",
            "Ocular involvement has not been described with either MERS-C\u00adoV or SARS-\u00adCoV11\u201313 although polymerase chain reaction on tears from patients with SARS-\u00adCoV infection demonstrated presence of the virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] There is also evidence that some coronavirus can occasionally cause conjunctivitis in humans. In fact, human coronavirus NL 63 (HCoV-N\u00ad L63) was first identified in a baby with bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Subsequent in 28 cases of children with confirmed HCoV-\u00ad NL63 infections, 17% had conjunctivitis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]"
