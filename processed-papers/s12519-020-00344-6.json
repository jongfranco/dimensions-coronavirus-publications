Several gradually presented with fever, fatigue, dry cough, accompanied by other upper respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, runny nose, and seldom gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory examination in pediatric patients showed that blood routine was often normal, and C-reactive protein was normal or transiently elevated. Lung imaging examination revealed mild increase of lung markings or ground-glass opacity or pneumonia.",

            "Interferon (IFN) is a group of low-molecular glycoproteins with similar structure and function, which is produced by host cells through antiviral response when the body is infected by virus. IFN is the first-line innate immune defense of the body against viral infection. Based on different gene and protein structures, IFN is divided into IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and so on. Interferon mainly plays antiviral effects through two ways: (1) inducing production of antiviral effector proteins, thereby inhibiting viral replication in the cells to protect normal cells from viral invasion; (2) activating cellular immunity by promoting proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), activating natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages to clear the virus. The body\u2019s endogenous IFN deficiency or insufficiency may lead to reduced antiviral activity. Children are susceptible to viral infections because of their immature immune function and relatively low levels of specific humoral and cellular immunity and IFN secretion.",
            "In 1973, Merigan et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] from the British Medical Research Center firstly confirmed that IFN could prevent and treat respiratory virus infections. Thereafter, many researches have been carried out to approve the findings. Multi-center clinical studies in children from China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] have also revealed that IFN-\u03b1 atomization can reduce the viral load, alleviate symptoms and shorten disease duration in treating viral infections including bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, acute upper respiratory tract infection and hand, foot and mouth disease. Our team also found that topical use of recombinant human IFN-\u03b12b spray in the mouth and nose can alleviate symptoms and shorten disease course of upper respiratory tract infections in children [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",
