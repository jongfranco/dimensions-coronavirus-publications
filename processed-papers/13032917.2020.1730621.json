        "abstract": "The coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China has sparked a global epidemic, which the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern on 31st January 2020 (Beijing time). This crisis has attracted intense media attention. Recently, some media outlets inappropriately labelled the coronavirus by race, using such headlines as \u201cChinese virus pandemonium\u201d and even suggesting \u201cChina kids stay home.\u201d The biased and misleading coverage presented via Western media channels has incited anger throughout the Chinese community and has placed undue stress upon Chinese individuals living outside China. This postpublished review takes a tourism-focused perspective to examine findings from a quantitative study (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRodriguez-Seijas_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rRodriguez-Seijas_et+al_2015_a\">Rodriguez-Seijas, Stohl, Hasin, & Eaton, 2015</a>) published in 2015 in JAMA Psychiatry. The current paper highlights the potential impacts of misleading and biased media coverage on Chinese individuals\u2019 mental health. Specifically, this work considers perceived racial discrimination stemming from coronavirus as a public health crisis and the effects of such discrimination on individuals of Chinese heritage. Similarly imperative are pertinent effects on country image and destination image with respect to tourism marketing and tourist behaviour during times of crisis. By considering racism in the context of the coronavirus outbreak, this paper identifies potential avenues for relevant research in tourism and hospitality.",

We are particularly interested in how NCP-related discrimination has pervaded Chinese communities, a phenomenon partially attributable to misleading and biased media coverage. Greater awareness of this topic may promote better informed media consumption as well as careful consideration of how news reports may affect involved parties. More interdisciplinary studies are also needed that examine the antecedents and consequences of racial discrimination relative to tourism marketing and tourist behaviour during public health crises and other large-scale events. Several tourism-related research gaps discussed herein will hopefully encourage researchers to delve more deeply into topics such as the impact of racial discrimination on destination image."

            "The coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China has sparked a global epidemic, which the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern on 31st January 2020 (Beijing time). This crisis has attracted intense media attention. Recently, some media outlets inappropriately labelled the coronavirus by race, using such headlines as \u201cChinese virus pandemonium\u201d and even suggesting \u201cChina kids stay home.\u201d The biased and misleading coverage presented via Western media channels has incited anger throughout the Chinese community and has placed undue stress upon Chinese individuals living outside China. This postpublished review takes a tourism-focused perspective to examine findings from a quantitative study (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRodriguez-Seijas_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rRodriguez-Seijas_et+al_2015_a\">Rodriguez-Seijas, Stohl, Hasin, & Eaton, 2015</a>) published in 2015 in JAMA Psychiatry. The current paper highlights the potential impacts of misleading and biased media coverage on Chinese individuals\u2019 mental health. Specifically, this work considers perceived racial discrimination stemming from coronavirus as a public health crisis and the effects of such discrimination on individuals of Chinese heritage. Similarly imperative are pertinent effects on country image and destination image with respect to tourism marketing and tourist behaviour during times of crisis. By considering racism in the context of the coronavirus outbreak, this paper identifies potential avenues for relevant research in tourism and hospitality.",

            "The proliferation of network and social media in the digital era has drastically altered information delivery. Today, media outlets are essential in providing the public with timely news coverage. These channels are expected to report on public crises or disasters professionally and promptly. Social media plays an important role in the public\u2019s perceptions of such events (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSchultz_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rSchultz_et+al_2011_a\">Schultz, Utz, & G\u00f6ritz, 2011</a>). A case in point is the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, China (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2020_a\">Huang et al, 2020</a>). The disease has become a global epidemic, claiming 724 lives in China thus far among 34,941 confirmed cases across Japan, Thailand, the U.S, Australia, and France (World Health Organization, 2020). On 31 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus strain a public health emergency of international concern, only the sixth of its kind (ABC News, 2020). On 8 February 2020, the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2020) renamed the new coronavirus \u201cnovel coronavirus pneumonia\u201d (NCP).",
            "The NCP outbreak in China has generated global concern, as evidenced by growing media coverage and public interest. Some media channels initially reported NCP as \u201cChinese virus pandemonium\u201d before China confirmed the condition\u2019s official name, inappropriately labelling the disease by race. Even bolder headlines, such as \u201cChina kids stay home\u201d and \u201cChina is the real sick man of Asia\u201d have misled members of the public and increased racial discrimination against individuals of Chinese descent outside mainland China. The media\u2019s perspective on NCP could thus affect the well-being of Chinese individuals.",
            "Effects of misleading media coverage on racial discrimination and mental disorders",
            "<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRodriguez-Seijas_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rRodriguez-Seijas_et+al_2015_a\">Rodriguez-Seijas et al (2015</a>) came to poignant conclusions regarding the association between racial discrimination and mental health among African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans. In a similar vein, the media\u2019s publication of biased headlines could presumably bring adverse effects to focal communities, namely through inequitable treatment and misperceptions. In the case of NCP, such coverage could affect Chinese people living overseas. Individuals could also develop mental health conditions that may persist in the current social climate. Unfortunately, RodriguezSeijas et al (2015) did not consider how media coverage conveying racial discrimination may have affected their nine discrimination scenarios. The broader literature has also largely neglected the media\u2019s role in such situations, hence our decision to address the potential impacts of misleading media coverage on perceived racial discrimination. Biased reporting could be associated with unique consequences during times of public crisis.",
            "Virus outbreaks can result in lost lives, negative impacts on businesses, and general stress. China has taken several steps to control the spread of NCP and, by extension, the aforementioned consequences. Relevant actions include the emergency establishment of two quarantine hospitals (Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital) within a 10-day span. Other protective measures have been enacted as well: Wuhan Hongshan Sports Centre, Wuhan Living Room, and Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Centre are functioning as temporary isolation areas, capable of accommodating up to 6,300 patients in total (China Daily, 2020a, 2020b, 2020c; Xinhua News, 2020). Medical workers and soldiers from other provinces are travelling to Wuhan to treat patients (China Daily, 2020d). Given that NCP poses a major threat to international public health, all countries must cooperate to combat it (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHui_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rHui_et+al_2020_a\">Hui et al, 2020</a>). Media channels should ideally deliver objective reports to increase support and understanding instead of presenting biased information; such coverage may only serve to divide individuals and stoke fear.",
            "Misleading media coverage around NCP has led people of Asian heritage, especially Chinese nationals and individuals of Chinese origin, to face intense discrimination. Tourists and others returning from China are being quarantined and sprayed with antiseptic upon arriving in their destination. Although this precaution may initially appear logical, such treatment could give rise to prejudice. Even Chinese people who have not travelled to their home country or who reside elsewhere are likely to encounter discrimination in their everyday lives at this time. For example, some schools and colleges are requesting that Chinese students not attend classes. Many Chineseowned establishments have been plagued by slow business since the outbreak. Anti-Chinese and anti-Asian xenophobia has also been reported in several countries including the U.S, Canada, the UK, Europe, Malaysia, and Australia. Many Chinese customers have been refused entry into restaurants in Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam; in Indonesia, Chinese hotel guests were asked to leave the country entirely (Amnesty International, 2020). These reactions are blatantly discriminatory and may negatively influence Chinese individuals\u2019 well-being (e.g. poor mental health related to social isolation and perceived distrust).",
            "Racial discrimination, country image, and destination image through a tourism lens",
            "Racial discrimination represents a violation of human rights; all human rights legislation seeks to uphold each person\u2019s right to coexist without discrimination, no matter their country of residence. News reports regarding racial discrimination against the Chinese during the NCP outbreak could have far-reaching effects beyond a personal level. For instance, negative news coverage could greatly compromise China\u2019s national and destination image. In the tourism literature, the constructs of country image and destination image are commonly applied to understand tourism marketing and tourist behaviour. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMossberg_2005_a\" href=\"#rMossberg_2005_a\">Mossberg and Kleppe (2005</a>) identified image objects related to country image and destination image as parallel research tracks in tourism.",
            "Specifically, concepts related to country image are organized within a hierarchical framework in which country image encompasses an image pool for product-related image concepts, whereas destination image serves as an umbrella concept for numerous geographical units that constitute a vertical framework. By combining these frameworks, Mosseberg and Kleppe (2005) identified substantial overlap between country image and destination image with respect to referent objects. Studies have also considered the effects of tourism satisfaction on country image, destination image, and travellers\u2019 post-visit intentions (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNisco_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rNisco_et+al_2015_a\">Nisco, Mainolfi, Marino, & Napolotano, 2015</a>). Other work has compared country image and destination image in Turkey (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMartinez_2010_a\" href=\"#rMartinez_2010_a\">Martinez & Alvarez, 2010</a>). However, no tourism research appears to have explored the associations among perceived racial discrimination, country image, and destination image, particularly in terms of how media coverage can influence daily life.",
            "Some human rights organizations have taken steps to dispel myths and alleviate public alarm related to NCP. Following reports of racial discrimination against Chinese nationals and other Asian citizens during the outbreak, the United Nations Human Rights Office issued the following statement on Twitter: It\u2019s understandable to be alarmed by #Coronavirus. But no amount of fear can excuse prejudice & discrimination against people of Asian descent. Let\u2019s #FightRacism, call out hatred & support each other in this time of a public health emergency.#StandUp4HumanRights.",
            "Individuals have also used Twitter to combat NCP-related racism. After a regional French newspaper expressed anti-Asian sentiment with the front-page headline \u201cYellow alert\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRich_2020_a\" href=\"#rRich_2020_a\">Rich, 2020</a>), Chinese people responded with the Twitter hashtag \u201c#JeNeSuisPasUnVirus\u201d (\u201cI am not a virus\u201d) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAguilera_2020_a\" href=\"#rAguilera_2020_a\">Aguilera, 2020</a>). The newspaper later issued an apology. Ontario\u2019s Human Rights Commission (OHRC) also discouraged discrimination against the Chinese, urging citizens to respect the human rights of Ontario\u2019s East Asian community. The organization further noted that discriminatory behaviour is prohibited under the Human Rights Code and that the coronavirus is not limited to individuals of any particular ethnicity, place of origin, or race (OHRC, 2020).",
            "Racial discrimination is an inherently interdisciplinary topic. The tourism industry in particular is built upon close contact among customers, service employees, and managers (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGill_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rGill_et+al_2010_a\">Gill, Fitzgerald, Bhutani, Mand, & Sharma, 2010</a>). The interactive nature of this industry presents numerous opportunities for racial discrimination. Although research efforts in other disciplines (e.g. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRodriguez-Seijas_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rRodriguez-Seijas_et+al_2015_a\">Rodriguez-Seijas et al, 2015</a>) have revealed valuable findings from a more clinical perspective, studies of racial discrimination in tourism and hospitality often involve certain contexts. A large body of work has focused on restaurant settings, namely in terms of employment, tipping behaviour, and racial profiling of customers (e.g. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBrewster_2012_a\" href=\"#rBrewster_2012_a\">Brewster, 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBrewster_2014_a\" href=\"#rBrewster_2014_a\">Brewster & Lynn, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDirks_2004_a\" href=\"#rDirks_2004_a\">Dirks & Rice, 2004</a>).",
            "However, according to <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTribe_1997_a\" href=\"#rTribe_1997_a\">Tribe (1997</a>), tourism has generally been recognized as a phenomenon rather than a discipline suited to expansive research lines. This perception may explain the relative lack of knowledge around the broader role of racial discrimination in tourism; the same can be said for the emerging literature on new media\u2019s place in this industry, especially in times of disaster. In today\u2019s high-tech society, tourism scholars may wish to engage in interdisciplinary studies (e.g. involving psychology, medicine, and law) to thoroughly explore how tourism marketing and tourist behaviour may relate to social media coverage. News reports on global concerns such as NCP, a disease tied to a specific country, may well shape individuals\u2019 travel decisions. The effects of these choices could easily trickle down to tourism revenue, destination marketing, and other aspects of tourism and hospitality."
        ],
        "Concluding remarks": [
            "In our review, we have drawn from key findings of <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRodriguez-Seijas_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rRodriguez-Seijas_et+al_2015_a\">Rodriguez-Seijas et al (2015</a>) to critically consider China\u2019s NCP outbreak. We are particularly interested in how NCP-related discrimination has pervaded Chinese communities, a phenomenon partially attributable to misleading and biased media coverage. Greater awareness of this topic may promote better informed media consumption as well as careful consideration of how news reports may affect involved parties. More interdisciplinary studies are also needed that examine the antecedents and consequences of racial discrimination relative to tourism marketing and tourist behaviour during public health crises and other large-scale events. Several tourism-related research gaps discussed herein will hopefully encourage researchers to delve more deeply into topics such as the impact of racial discrimination on destination image."
