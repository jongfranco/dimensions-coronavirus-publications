        "abstract": "Background: Influenza is a zoonotic disease that infects millions of people each year resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, and in turn devastating pandemics. Influenza is caused by influenza viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). There are many subtypes of IAV but only a few seem to be able to adapt to humans and to cause disease. In 2013, an H7N9 IAV subtype emerged in China that does not cause clinical symptoms in its chicken host but leads to severe infections when transmitted into humans. Since 2013, there have been six epidemic waves of H7N9 with 1567 laboratory-confirmed human infections and 615 deaths. Pathogenicity of IAV is complex, but a crucial feature contributing to virulence is the activation of the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein by host proteases that triggers membrane fusion and leads to subsequent virus propagation. Methods: 293T, VERO, and MDCK cells were used to conduct Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence assays, and pseudoparticle and live virus infections, and to evaluate H7N9 HA cleavage-activation. Results/Conclusions: We show that human matriptase/ST 14 is able to cleave H7N9 HA. Cleavage of H7N9 HA expressed in cell culture results in fusogenic HA and syncytia formation. In infection studies with viral pseudoparticles carrying matriptase/ ST 14-activated H7N9 HA, we observed a high infectivity of cells. Finally, human matriptase/ST 14 also activated H7N9 live virus which resulted in high infectivity. Our data demonstrate that human matriptase/ST 14 is a likely candidate protease to promote H7N9 infections in humans.",

            "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate in waterfowl as their natural reservoir and are categorized based on the antigenic properties of their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. There are 16 different HAs and nine different NA present in wild birds.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Frequently, wild birds infect poultry resulting in the culling of millions of birds and significant economic losses.

        "1 | INTRODUCTION": [
            "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate in waterfowl as their natural reservoir and are categorized based on the antigenic properties of their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. There are 16 different HAs and nine different NA present in wild birds.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Frequently, wild birds infect poultry resulting in the culling of millions of birds and significant economic losses. However, wild birds rarely show disease symptoms while IAV in poultry usually exhibits respiratory tropism and is able to mutate into a more highly pathogenic form.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] Influenza is also a zoonotic disease, and the virus is occasionally transmitted from infected poultry to humans. Certain HA/ NA combinations, however, seem to be more favorable for human infections. H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 have caused several devastating outbreaks in humans in the past such as the 1918 \u201cSpanish flu,\u201d the 1957 \u201cAsian pandemic,\u201d the 1968 \u201cHong Kong pandemic,\u201d and the 2009 \u201cSwine flu,\u201d respectively.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]",
            "Currently, the recently emerged H7N9 strain is of concern for global public health. Low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7N9 was first discovered in humans in 2013 in China when three patients were hospitalized with severe and fatal influenza.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Since then, there have been six epidemic H7N9 waves that resulted in 1567 laboratory-confirmed human infections and 615 deaths and a seventh wave is currently ongoing.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] Intriguingly, the virus isolated from the 2013 outbreak was suggested to be derived from chickens that did not show any (or only very mild) symptoms of disease. Further investigations revealed that the viral genes were exclusively from avian origin.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] To this date, there are no reports of H7N9 human to human transmissions even though it cannot be excluded in very few cases. However, most cases of human H7N9 infections were attributed to exposure of humans to infected wild birds or poultry and live animal markets.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]",
            "A crucial step in the life cycle of H7N9 (and all other influenza subtypes) is the cleavage of its HA fusion protein by host proteases. HA is synthesized as a precursor and requires proteolytic processing to exert its fusogenic activity. Cleavage occurs at the C-terminus of the fusion peptide and results in its exposure allowing HA to induce fusion of the viral and cellular membrane and subsequent release of the RNA into the host cell.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] LPAI viruses have a monobasic cleavage site that consists of a single arginine, which is preceded by three amino acids that are influenza subtype-specific. While LPAI viruses in wild birds are usually cleaved by trypsin in their gastro-intestinal tract, there are trypsin-like serine proteases in humans and poultry that reside in the respiratory tract and which are able to process these viruses. Therefore, the disease is usually confined to this tissue.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]",
            "Only very little is known about the activation of H7N9 viruses. Previously, it was reported that the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 plays a role in the cleavage of H7N9 HA and activation of the virus in mice.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Both studies showed that TMPRSS2 knockout (KO) mice were highly tolerant to H7N9 infections. When KO mice were complemented with human or mouse TMPRSS2, their susceptibility to the virus was restored.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]",
            "We recently reported that human matriptase/ST 14 was able to very efficiently cleave a H7N9 cleavage motif peptide mimic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Matriptase/ST 14 is a membrane-bound protease localized in epithelial cells of various tissues in humans that seems to play a significant role in the activation of various influenza A subtypes such H1N1 and H9N2.12,13 However, results obtained using cleavage site peptide mimics do not always reflect the in vivo situation and need to be validated.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]",
            "Here, we show that human matriptase/ST 14 cleaves H7N9 HA resulting in a fusogenic active protein. We further demonstrate that matriptase/ST 14 promotes the infectivity of pseudoparticles carrying H7N9. Ultimately, we provide data showing the activation of A/ Shanghai/2/2013 virus by human matriptase/ST 14 leading to a high infectivity in cell culture. Together, our data suggest that matriptase/ ST 14 is a novel protease in the human respiratory tract that promotes H7N9 infection."

We did not observe any cleavage of H7N9 HA without protease, and very efficient cleavage when trypsin was added (Figure 1A). Recombinant human matriptase/ST 14 cleaved H7N9, too, but to a lesser extent than trypsin (Figure 1A). Quantification revealed that trypsin converted about 80% of HA0 into HA1 and matriptase/ST 14 proteolytically processed about 30% HA0 into HA1 (Figure 1B).",

Cells were lysed 48 hours after infection with the pseudoparticles, and the cell lysate was mixed with luciferase substrate. Measurement of the relative fluorescence provides a quantitative analysis of the infectivity.",

However, there was no significant difference between trypsin- and matriptase/ST 14-treated pseudoparticles suggesting that all pseudovirions were depleted (Figure 1B, Table 1A). Pseudoparticles without an incorporated fusion protein were not infectious. The data show that matriptase/ST 14-mediated cleavage of H7N9 HA results in fully infectious virions that are able to fuse with host cells.",

        "4 | DISCUSSION": [
            "Influenza H7N9 viruses have caused a significant number of causalities since their emergence in 2013 and pose a major threat for public health because of their ability to continuously evolve and reassort.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] This is well-illustrated by the finding that H7N9 viruses from the 5th wave were antigenically distinct from the viruses that emerged in 2013, rendering existing candidate vaccines ineffective.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] Novel approaches to fight influenza infections include targeting host proteases that are responsible for the activation of the virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] A major benefit of this approach is that it is very unlikely to lead to resistance phenotypes in the virus. However, it requires the information by which proteases distinct influenza HA subtypes are proteolytically activated.",
            "So far, the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 is the only human protease that has been associated with the activation of LPAI H7N9 HA.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] TMPRSS2 KO mice showed no clinical signs of disease and very limited spread of the virus when infected with A/Anhui/1/2013.

Matriptase/ ST 14 also expresses selective HA cleavage for particular strains within the H1 subtype.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]",
            "In the context of our work, it is important to point out that a vast majority of human LPAI H7N9 strains share the same HA cleavage site motif as A/Shanghai/2/2013. We analyzed 1352 LPAI H7N9 sequences from human isolates collected between 2013 and 2019 that are available at the GISAID database (https://platform.gisaid.org/epi3/frontend#1001b7). Only seven sequences showed changes in the HA cleavage site motif; six strains pfu/mL",
            "We recently showed that matriptase/ST 14 cleaved a peptide representing the H7N9 LPAI HA cleavage motif very efficiently using an assay with fluorogenic peptides representing different HA subtype cleavage site mimics. A limitation of this assay is that peptides may produce false-positive results because the structural interaction between protease and cleavage site might be altered compared to the full-length HA protein. Matriptase/ST 14, for example, was reported to proteolytically process the A/ Aichi/2/68 H3N2 HA cleavage site motif in peptide assays.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] When matriptase/ST 14 was then tested with the A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2 HA full-length protein expressed in cells, only little cleavage that did not produce fusogenic HA or no cleavage was observed. Here we demonstrate that human matriptase/ST 14 cleaves H7N9 HA expressed in cells resulting in a fully fusogenic active protein validating our results from the previously published peptide assay. Matriptase/ST 14-mediated cleavage of H7N9 HA also promoted the infectivity of pseudovirions and A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus in cell culture. Our data indicate that human matriptase/ST 14 is a relevant protease to cause LPAI H7N9 infectivity in humans and may represent an important pathogenicity determinant and target for therapeutic intervention."
