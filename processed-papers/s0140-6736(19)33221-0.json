        "abstract": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic pathogen that was first identified in humans in Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2012. Intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV continue to occur. Between April 2012 and December 2019, 2499 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 858 deaths (34\u00b73% mortality) were reported from 27 countries to WHO, the majority of which were reported by Saudi Arabia (2106 cases, 780 deaths). Large outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South Korea in 2015. MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by WHO as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures. This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.",

These proteins are required for the formation of the replicase-transcription complex, for cleavage of the polyprotein, and for immune evasion. Structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]) and accessory proteins (ORFs 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 8b) are encoded in the end third of the 3\u2019 end of the genome of the genome. MERS-CoV binds to its cellular receptor DPP4 via the S protein, which is processed by host proteases to expose a fusion peptide. The viral genome is then released into the cytoplasm, where it is translated on host ribosomes into rep1A and rep1B proteins. The polyprotein is cleaved by two viral-encoded proteases, encoded by nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] and nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Proteins involved in genome and subgenome replication and transcription include nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] (the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP]) and two associated proteins, nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] and nsp8.127 Nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] (a helicase), nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] (which encodes an N7 methyltransferase and ExoN, a protein required for genome fidelity), and nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] (a 2\u2019-O methyltransferase) are also necessary for optimal genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis. MERS-CoV transcription involves the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs, which encode the structural and accessory proteins located at the 3\u2019 end of the genome. Subgenomic and genomic RNAs are co-terminal, sharing the same 5\u2019 leader and 3\u2019 sequences. Subgenomic RNAs code for structural and accessory proteins (ORF3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b). ORF8b is encoded within the N gene (marked with purple lines). These accessory proteins are believed to have immunoevasive properties, but are not essential for replication, and are variably deleted in human and camel virus isolates.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c128\" href=\"#r128\">128</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c130\" href=\"#r130\">130</a>] Genomic replication occurs on membrane structures such as double membrane vesicles (DMVs), convoluted membranes (CM), and vesicle packets (VP), which are merged DMV131 that have been formed from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) by the combined action of nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] (lower right). After synthesis on replicase-transcription complexes, RNA is encapsidated by the N protein and transported to the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi compartment), where budding into membranes containing the S, E, and M proteins occurs before release from the cell. 3CLPro=chymotrypsin-like protease.

These proteins are required for the formation of the replicase-transcription complex, for cleavage of the polyprotein, and for immune evasion. Structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]) and accessory proteins (ORFs 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 8b) are encoded in the end third of the 3\u2019 end of the genome of the genome. MERS-CoV binds to its cellular receptor DPP4 via the S protein, which is processed by host proteases to expose a fusion peptide. The viral genome is then released into the cytoplasm, where it is translated on host ribosomes into rep1A and rep1B proteins. The polyprotein is cleaved by two viral-encoded proteases, encoded by nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] and nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Proteins involved in genome and subgenome replication and transcription include nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] (the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRP]) and two associated proteins, nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] and nsp8.127 Nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] (a helicase), nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] (which encodes an N7 methyltransferase and ExoN, a protein required for genome fidelity), and nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] (a 2\u2019-O methyltransferase) are also necessary for optimal genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis. MERS-CoV transcription involves the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs, which encode the structural and accessory proteins located at the 3\u2019 end of the genome. Subgenomic and genomic RNAs are co-terminal, sharing the same 5\u2019 leader and 3\u2019 sequences. Subgenomic RNAs code for structural and accessory proteins (ORF3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b). ORF8b is encoded within the N gene (marked with purple lines). These accessory proteins are believed to have immunoevasive properties, but are not essential for replication, and are variably deleted in human and camel virus isolates.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c128\" href=\"#r128\">128</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c130\" href=\"#r130\">130</a>] Genomic replication occurs on membrane structures such as double membrane vesicles (DMVs), convoluted membranes (CM), and vesicle packets (VP), which are merged DMV131 that have been formed from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) by the combined action of nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] (lower right). After synthesis on replicase-transcription complexes, RNA is encapsidated by the N protein and transported to the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi compartment), where budding into membranes containing the S, E, and M proteins occurs before release from the cell. 3CLPro=chymotrypsin-like protease. ExoN=exonuclease. MERS-CoV=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. MTase=methyltransferase. NendoU=nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease.
