Methods We describe the 18F-FDG PET/CT results from four patients who were admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever between January 13 and January 20, 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was still unrecognized and the virus infectivity was unknown. A retrospective review of the patients\u2019 medical history, clinical and laboratory data, as well as imaging findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of COVID-19. Results All patients had peripheral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in more than two pulmonary lobes. Lung lesions were characterized by a high 18F-FDG uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Conversely, disseminated disease was absent, a finding suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism. Conclusions Although 18F-FDG PET/CT cannot be routinely used in an emergency setting and is generally not recommended for infectious diseases, our pilot data shed light on the potential clinical utility of this imaging technique in the differential diagnosis of complex cases.",

However, only 30\u201350% of infected patients had positive test for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid on RT-PCR (Chinese Academy of Sciences; unpublished data). High rates of false-negative findings may be explained by several reasons, including (1) the lack of SOPs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, differences in sample handling, storage, and processing, (2) disease stages and different viral loads according to anatomical site (e.g., alveoli versus upper respiratory tract), (3) the lack of independent validation of current testing, and (4) the potential high mutation rates of COVID-19. In light of these limitations, some cases of COVID-19 in China are currently diagnosed on clinical, laboratory, and imaging grounds, without resorting to molecular confirmation.",
