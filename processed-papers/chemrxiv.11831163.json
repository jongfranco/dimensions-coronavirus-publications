        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;2019-nCoV has caused more than 560 deaths as of 6 February 2020 worldwide, mostly in China. Although there are no effective drugs approved, many clinical trials are incoming or ongoing in China which utilize traditional chinese medicine or modern medicine. Moreover, many groups are working on the cytopathic effect assay to fight against 2019-nCoV, which will result in compounds with good activity yet unknown targets. Identifying potential drug targets will be of great importance to understand the underlying mechanism of how the drug works. Here, we &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;compiled&lt;/a&gt; the 3D structures of 17 2019-nCoV proteins and 3 related human proteins, which resulted in 208 binding pockets. Each submitted compound will be docked to these binding pockets by the docking software smina and the docking results will be presented in ascending order of compound-target interaction energy (kcal/mol). We hope the computational tool will shed some light on the potential drug target for the identified antivirals.

            "The superiority to use the docking method to predict the target is that docking result shows the binding mode of the compound into the target, which is very useful for the mutagenesis validation. According to the binding mode of NTP to the RdRp (Figure), hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions play an important role in the high affinity. In detail, the hydrogen bonds between NTP and some crucial residues in RdRp, such as GLU-811, TRP-800 and SER-814, may determine the ability to suppress 2019-nCoV. Besides, there is a strong electrostatic attraction between the phosphate group of NTP with two Mg2+, which may be helpful to explain the preference of RdRp for nucleotide analogs. The docking result of NTP is in consistent with the experiment, demonstrating the accuracy and robustness of D3Targets-2019-nCoV in exploring drug targets."

        "4. Conclusions": [
            "2019-nCoV has caused more than 560 deaths as of 6 February 2020 worldwide, mostly in China. Although there are no effective drugs approved, many clinical trials are incoming or ongoing in China which utilize traditional chinese medicine or modern medicine. Moreover, many groups are working on the cytopathic effect assay to fight against 2019-nCoV, which will result in compounds with good activity yet unknown targets. Therefore, identifying potential drug targets will be of great importance to develop effective drugs. Here, we compiled 3D structures of 17 2019-nCoV proteins and 3 related human proteins, which resulted in 208 binding pockets. We run vsREMD simulation on Mpro, a promising target against 2019-nCoV, and find two pockets of high druggability. Each submitted compound will be docked to these binding pockets by smina and the docking results will be presented in ascending order of compound-target interaction energy (kcal/mol). When testing an antiviral against 2019-nCoV, i.e., remdesivir, the proposed target RdRp ranks 1st, demonstrating the usefulness of the computational tool. We hope D3Targets-2019-nCoV will shed some light on the potential drug target for the identified antivirals, which is available free of charge at https://www.d3pharma.com/D3Targets-2019-nCoV/D3Docking/index.php."
