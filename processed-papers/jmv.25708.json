        "abstract": "The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) since December 2019 in Wuhan, the major transportation hub in central China, became an emergency of major international concern. While several etiological studies have begun to reveal the specific biological features of this virus, the epidemic characteristics need to be elucidated. Notably, a long incubation time was reported to be associated with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, leading to adjustments in screening and control policies. To avoid the risk of virus spread, all potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for 14 days, which is the longest predicted incubation time. However, based on our analysis of a larger dataset available so far, we find there is no observable difference between the incubation time for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), highlighting the need for larger and well\u2010annotated datasets.",

            "Biological investigation of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 biology has revealed several general characteristics of the virus. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is a novel coronavirus, which has a ~30 kb single\u2010stranded positive sense RNA genome with an organization typical of other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Although phylogenetic analysis indicate it belongs to the same \u03b2\u2010coronavirus genus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010 CoV), SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has a higher genome\u2010sequence similarity to several \u03b2\u2010coronaviruses detected in bats. It shows more than 96% identity to a known bat coronavirus, compared to 79.5% identity to SARS\u2010CoV BJ01.1,2",
            "Studies investigating the clinical characteristics, epidemic and treatment have also been carried out. According to clinical investigation of the pneumonia cases in China, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection causes SARS with major symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia, or fatigue and minor symptoms such as sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]"
