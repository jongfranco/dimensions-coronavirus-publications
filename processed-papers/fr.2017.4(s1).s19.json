        "abstract": "The approaching of megatrend 2050, challenges have emerged in the food sector and it is\npredicted that main issues would be the shortage of food supply and food contamination.\nIn parallel to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), that by 2050, with the\nincreasing human population, the food supply would be affected as the sources are\ninadequate to cater. This crisis requires a comprehensive solution \u2013 necessitate a better\nfood security policy, food safety and food defence. In other words, a focused policy that\ndeals with safe food ecosystem must be implemented and strengthen by relevant\nauthorities. In the Malaysian context, the National Safety Policy (2017) outlined the\nsecurity assurance for the nation\u2019s food supply under Strategy 17. However, the focus of\nthe policy is only on the preparedness of rice commodity that needs to be adequate,\nwhereas, newer threats is making their way beyond that scope. Therefore, this review will\ndiscuss the potential of food terrorism, its concept and implication within the halal\necosystem. To achieve this objective, this study is qualitatively carried out by utilizing\nfully library research relating to food terrorism. The data is being analysed to conclude the\nfindings. Based on the study, we found that food terrorism is indeed a real threat\njeopardizing consumer safety, and moreover, causing negative implications towards the\nlocal, regional and global halal ecosystem. Therefore, proactive measures needed to be\ntaken to ensure the security of food and this aligned with the objective of sharia to\npreserve human\u2019s life by having adequate, nutritious, halal and safe food.",

            "The issues highlighted in this study must be resolved with a comprehensive approach. One of the solutions is to introduce a specific terminology to address these threats so that the halal food industry is more systematic especially towards food content determination for the benefit of all consumer. All of these threats requires a food protection plan to safeguard \u201csafe food\u201d assurance with the preservation of halal ecosystem in parallel to National Safety Policy and towards the 2050 national transformation plan. Furthermore, this research is carried out to identify the threats of food; crime and terrorism. By that, a comprehensive food protection plan in halalan toyyiban chain should be developed and designed to be fit the Islamic sharia principle."

        "Abstract": [
            "The approaching of megatrend 2050, challenges have emerged in the food sector and it is predicted that main issues would be the shortage of food supply and food contamination. In parallel to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), that by 2050, with the increasing human population, the food supply would be affected as the sources are inadequate to cater. This crisis requires a comprehensive solution \u2013 necessitate a better food security policy, food safety and food defence. In other words, a focused policy that deals with safe food ecosystem must be implemented and strengthen by relevant authorities. In the Malaysian context, the National Safety Policy (2017) outlined the security assurance for the nation\u2019s food supply under Strategy 17. However, the focus of the policy is only on the preparedness of rice commodity that needs to be adequate, whereas, newer threats is making their way beyond that scope. Therefore, this review will discuss the potential of food terrorism, its concept and implication within the halal ecosystem. To achieve this objective, this study is qualitatively carried out by utilizing fully library research relating to food terrorism. The data is being analysed to conclude the findings. Based on the study, we found that food terrorism is indeed a real threat jeopardizing consumer safety, and moreover, causing negative implications towards the local, regional and global halal ecosystem. Therefore, proactive measures needed to be taken to ensure the security of food and this aligned with the objective of sharia to preserve human\u2019s life by having adequate, nutritious, halal and safe food."

The United States has foreseen the threats prompted Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) signed by President Barrack Obama in 2011 giving to the new scope of safe food protection and authority to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (FDA, 2019). Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present the threat of malicious food contamination, particularly food terrorism towards the halal ecosystem."

It started from traditional to newer form, such as cyber-terrorism, bioterrorism and food terrorism. Food terrorism is defined by World Health Organization (WHO) as: \u201can act or threat of deliberate contamination of food for human consumption with chemical, biological, or radionuclear agents for the purpose of causing injury or death to civilian populations and/or disrupting social, economic or political stability.\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cEreifej_2011_a\" href=\"#rEreifej_2011_a\">Ereifej, 2011</a>).

Food terrorism is not much different from food safety as they both share the same types of threats: chemical, biological, physical, radio-nuclear, and allergens (Food Act 1983, 2018). The difference between the two can be distinguished from the motivation, i.e. ideology (for food terrorism), whereas food safety issue largely deals with unintentional contamination rather than intentional.",
            "Food terrorism involved malicious attacks upon food sources, especially agricultural sources in form of agroterrorism or bioterrorism. CATRC (2010) defined agroterrorism as: \u201cAct of destruction towards whole agricultural system including infrastructure, input, process and product intended to harm domestic and international interest of the targeted nation, and for the political interest of the attacker.\u201d The reasons of agroterrorism act are the intention to alter and interfere with the food supply chain to fulfil demands of a certain commodity.

This includes cattle or farmed animal, dairy products, food products within the processing chain, distribution, retails, warehousing, transportation and crops. The agricultural sector of all nations is vulnerable to terror threats. For example, the usage of poisonous additive with the intention to disrupt planted crops or farmed animals. These agents can be put at any level within the agricultural infrastructure in which become the main source of food to the consumer.

In 2002, the WHO published a guidebook entitled: Food Safety Issues: Terrorist Threats to Food became one of the earliest references for food terrorism. WHO has defined food terrorism as an act or threat of deliberate contamination of food for human consumption with chemical, biological or radio nuclear agents for the purpose of causing injury or death to civilian populations and/or disrupting social, economic or political stability. In our view, this is the most elaborate and precise definition and thus will be the reference for this paper. The guidebook is an effort to promote state member to beef up existing food safety programme in particular deliberate acts of sabotage of food.",

In medieval times, this practice of military campaign is implemented as one strategy to weaken the enemy\u2019s position beside conventional weapons. This includes poisoning the water supply and food source to stir panic, terror and even death among the civil population. Food terrorism is closely related to bioterrorism and agroterrorism and this will be discussed later in this paper. Food terrorism is a vital part of food defence, a concept that becomes the umbrella concept that covers food crime and food terrorism. Most of the literature found are more focused on food defence and food terrorism is mentioned as part of that bigger concept.

Therefore, this indicates that food terrorism will greatly affect the halal ecosystem, its components and its health performance as well.",
            "To apply in the halal ecosystem, the concept of food terrorism must be positioned and fit with the concept of halalan toyyiban. Therefore, we would like to propose a new concept, which is called \u2018Halal Food Terrorism\u2019 (HFT). Before going deeper into the concept, it is useful to understand how the concept of food terrorism can be applied within halalan toyyiban framework. Halalan toyyiban is the central concept of Islamic dietary law (Al-Quran 2:186). The terminology is a combination of two Arabic words of \u201chalal\u201d and \u201ctoyyiban\u201d. In al-Quran, the word halalan toyyiban is mentioned several times, suggesting that the two components are complimentary. Separately, the word \u201chalal\u201d means permissible; an act, object or conduct over which the individual has freedom of choice and its exercise does not carry either a reward or a punishment (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKamali_2013_a\" href=\"#rKamali_2013_a\">Kamali, 2013</a>). Simply put, it means the religion allowed to do so or to be taken. The opposite of \u201chalal\u201d is \u201charam\u201d which means prohibited. In term of dietary law, Islam has outlined few features of sources that are prohibited, but the rest that unmentioned (al-Quran or prophetic tradition) is considered permissible as the legal maxim stated: \u201cthe origin of everything is permissible unless proven otherwise\u201d (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cQaradhawi_2012_a\" href=\"#rQaradhawi_2012_a\">Qaradhawi, 2012</a>). Based on this, we can understand that the concept of \u201chalal\u201d primarily denotes the religious obligation, where every prohibited food sources are clearly and explicitly mentioned in the al-Quran and prophetic tradition.",
            "The second word, though it should not be seen as a separate obligation, is \u201ctoyyiban\u201d. Toyyiban or toyyib can be defined generally as \u201cgood\u201d. Based on previous literature, the concept of toyyiban is dynamic and flexible compared to halal concept, where it can be interpreted in various meaning such as nutritious, healthy, high quality, wholesome, clean, pure, or hygienic. The level of toyyib also differs and varying according to Islamic jurisprudence school of thoughts, where Maliki seems to have a broader standard pertaining to victuals (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKamali_2013_a\" href=\"#rKamali_2013_a\">Kamali, 2013</a>). <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKamali_2013_a\" href=\"#rKamali_2013_a\">Kamali (2013</a>) also argued that toyyib is all about purity and natural appeal in food selection. In short, halal is the shariabased element, where toyyiban is more towards the quality-related element, suggesting that these two are complementary with each other in the halalan toyyiban conceptual. Many literature put emphasize that the toyyiban aspect regarded as food safety. Therefore, this leaves a gap in order to relate toyyiban aspect with the concept of food defence. This is because, food safety is a separate concept and has different objective as well as mitigation strategy from food defense, even though both are the key elements under one roof: food protection. Based on this argument, it is clear that there is a necessity for new inclusion for toyyiban so that it applies to the contemporary safe food concept.",
            "According to the studies carried out by Moyer and Spink (2011), Busta and Kennedy (2011) and National Center for Food Protection and Defence (NCFPD), food control system must include two types of food contamination or modification which are unintentional and intentional. A full food control system should have 4 domains which are (i) food quality, (ii) food safety, (iii) food defence and (iv) food security. NCFPD combined domain (ii) and (iii) as part of food protection\u2019s core elements (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFredrickson_2014_a\" href=\"#rFredrickson_2014_a\">Fredrickson, 2014</a>).

The main objective is to ensure food are safe to eat and free from dangerous levels of harmful infectious and toxic agents (natural and accidental contamination) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavidson_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rDavidson_et+al_2017_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavidson_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rDavidson_et+al_2017_a\">Davidson et al, 2017</a></a>). Food defence is defined by <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavidson_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rDavidson_et+al_2017_a\">Davidson et al (2017</a>) as the methodology and countermeasures are taken to prevent and mitigate the effects of intentional incidents and threats to the food chain. This includes what is known as food crime; where food fraud (economically motivated) and food terrorism (ideologically motivated) fall into this category (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavidson_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rDavidson_et+al_2017_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavidson_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rDavidson_et+al_2017_a\">Davidson et al, 2017</a></a>).",
            "Based on the food protection framework, halal food protection framework can be established by applying the similar basis, but with slightly different interpretation and meaning. By referring all the cases of halalan toyyiban threats discussed earlier, it shows that it share similar pattern except that halalan toyyiban threats are inclusive of halal hazards or contaminants. Incidents of halalan toyyiban food chain also include the unintentional contamination, such as Cadbury 2014 case, intentional contamination such as economically motivated adulteration (where non-halal substance mixed together with halal product to cut cost). And halal food terrorism. From this point, the 4 domains in the food protection system, we concluded that is the accurate representation of toyyiban aspect. Therefore, we would like to propose a halal food protection framework that includes: halal food assurance and halal food terrorism.",
            "Furthermore, food terrorism can be described within halalan toyyiban perspective as follows: Food terrorism can be classified into two categories, the first one named as halal food terrorism. Halal food terrorism is defined as an act of deliberate contamination towards halal food with haram substance such as carrion, blood, swine, unslaughtered halal animal, intoxicant or other impurities with the intention to disrupt social, economy, political stability or otherwise create terror or panic. Toyyiban food terrorism, on the other hand, refers to the conventional food terrorism concept of which the selection of agent which may not explicitly mention in Islamic primary legal sources such as biological, chemical, physical, radio-nuclear and allergens. Halal food terrorism causes disruption towards the political, economy and social stability of Muslim society and above all, it\u2019s disrupt spiritual purity in micro-level. In Islam, the relation with the Creator (spirituality) is a virtue, and food can be a factor affecting the spirituality. A hadith from prophetic tradition recorded: \u201cA person travels for a long time in the way of Allah, his hair dishevelled and covered with dust. He lifts his hand towards the sky and makes supplication: \u201cO Lord, O Lord!\u201d However, what he eats is haram, his drink is haram, and his clothes are haram. How can his supplication be accepted since he feeds himself with haram?\u201d (Muslim, Hadith No 19). The framework of total halal food protection is illustrated in Figure 2.",
            "For toyyiban food terrorism, the implication towards micro-level is political, economy and social stability and for the micro-level, it can cause illness or death. The health performance of halal ecosystem must ensure that both types of food terrorism avoided or mitigated. The affected components include the halal industry, industry player, product and services as well as the consumers. Without mitigation strategy, this threat will become the halal supply chain disruptor. Figure 3 shows the impacts of both halal and toyyiban food terrorism in macro-scale and the micro-scale. The implication of such threats can be described as follows: a. Disruption of food sources and halal food chain",
            "Food terrorism activity harming water sources and food can cause a shortage of food. This is because bigscale contamination leads to the limitedness of consumer\u2019s necessities. This eventually leads to the food crisis and famine.",
            "The usage of biological and chemical weapon as a means of attack towards food and agricultural products can cause negative implication towards the consumer. Biological attack on farmed animals in particular, can cause the wide spreading of diseases within the population. For example, the SARS attack on birds resulting death of farmed chicken and infection to human. Another example is the attack of Mad Cow\u2019s Disease (BSE) towards the farmed cow and transmitted to human who consumed the infected meat, the attack of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) towards reared camels which latter transmitted to human (WHO, 2019). This clearly will harm human\u2019s health and life at risk.",
            "Halal and pure food can be changed its status when mixed with haram substance. When a food terrorist attack targeted halal food source, it can alter their status that initially permissible. For example, if it is mixed with an impure substance such as porcine DNA, or harmful elements, the status of food changed to haram.",
            "Apart from harmful effects, food crime and terrorism towards a halal product can lead to consumers\u2019 hesitation. This is because they lose the trust towards the original product due to contamination with haram and high-risk substance. For instance, the viral attack on the farmed cow with a specific virus can cause a drop of demands for beef supply due to loss of trust. The similar situation when farmed chicken with SARS virus, the demand for fresh chicken meat has dropped because of consumer fear for the risk of infection of the dangerous disease. Therefore, the food producer must not take lightly regarding halal product issue because it can affect trust and belief of consumer towards food products.",
            "Halal product has its own unique identity in terms of preparation towards the consumer. Hygiene assurance and haram substance-free is the top priority for the halal product. When there are crime and terrorism involved halal food, it will affect their halal status. An attack would likely become questionable for the consumer.",
            "Halal industry, particularly in Malaysia, has undergone a series of transformation in order to maintain the quality of this industry. In the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (RMK-11) halal industry has been supported and approved by the government. The record shows that RM42 billion worth of halal products exported in 2015 and 9% of total export contributed by Bumiputera companies. This clearly shows that the halal industry mechanism in Malaysia put effort to maintain and improve its reputation. Nevertheless, with the advancement of technology, halal product also vulnerable to criminal threats as mentioned earlier in this study. This indirectly will interfere with the halal industry stability that affects both and the local and international market."
        ],
        "8. Conclusion": [
            "The issues highlighted in this study must be resolved with a comprehensive approach. One of the solutions is to introduce a specific terminology to address these threats so that the halal food industry is more systematic especially towards food content determination for the benefit of all consumer. All of these threats requires a food protection plan to safeguard \u201csafe food\u201d assurance with the preservation of halal ecosystem in parallel to National Safety Policy and towards the 2050 national transformation plan. Furthermore, this research is carried out to identify the threats of food; crime and terrorism. By that, a comprehensive food protection plan in halalan toyyiban chain should be developed and designed to be fit the Islamic sharia principle."
