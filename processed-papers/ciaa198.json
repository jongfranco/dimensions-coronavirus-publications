According to China CDC protocol for detection 2019-nCoV, a duplex one-step real-time RT-PCR was performed to confirm 2019-nCoV infection at the local CDC reference laboratory.

A cycle threshold value less than 35 was defined as a positive test. All pediatric cases were hospitalized for the screening of 2019-nCoV infection when they were considered as suspected cases based on the following two criteria: having an epidemiological link to adult cases or an exposure to Wuhan or other epidemic areas in Hubei province and presenting with acute fever and or respiratory symptoms. All patients were admitted to the isolation ward within 2 days after illness onset and nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were collected immediately for the detection of 2019-nCoV.

Eight (80%) children had direct contact with adult patients with 2019-nCoV infection who had a history of travel to Wuhan or contact with persons from Wuhan. Exposure setting included household exposure in 7 patients (70%), endemic area exposure in 2 patients (20%), and bus travelling exposure in 1 (10%) patient who had contact with 2 adult travellers from Wuhan who already had mild respiratory symptoms during the bus travelling and were confirmed with COVID after returning to Wuhan. Among seven children exposed to household adult cases, the number of secondary symptomatic cases including the child ranged from 1 to 4 (mean: 2.43). For the 3-month-old infant (patient 7 in Table), her parents developed symptomatic COVID 7 days after they looked after the sick baby without protection measures. The interval between symptom onset and exposure to index symptomatic case ranged from 2 to 10 days (mean: 6.5 days) and the interval between symptom onset and departure from endemic areas was 1 day and 9 days."

        "discussion": [
            "This is the first case series report on 2019-nCoV infection in children. Our preliminary clinical findings showed that children with COVID usually presented with mild respiratory infections, as compared with adult cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. For pediatric patients, fever and mild cough are common symptoms at disease onset. For mild case, fever is brief and resolved rapidly. A few of patients presenting with/without cough also showed radiographic evidence of patchy infiltrate at symptom onset. In one study of a family cluster, an asymptomatic 10-year-old child infected with 2019-nCoV due to household exposure had radiological ground-glass lung opacities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Radiographic evidence of pneumonia was a characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection at the earliest stage of infection, thus, close observation is very necessary for a child with either mild symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. We don\u2019t recommend use of antiviral agents for the treatment of self-limited non-severe COVID because no evidence has shown the effectiveness of antiviral agents currently available. Influenza virus screening is necessary to rule out the possible coinfection considering the seasonal overlap between influenza and COVID. Empirical antibiotic initiation is not recommended for treatment of non-severe 2019-nCoV-associated pneumonia without evidence of superbacterial infection. By 22 January 2020, all notifiable COVID cases and severe cases were aged \u226715 years old in Wuhan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. In theory, children are also susceptible to 2019-nCoV and mild or atypical cases were largely underdiagnosed according to the initial screening criteria which focused on suspected pneumonia case [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]."

        "Discussion": [
            "This is the first case series report on 2019-nCoV infection in children. Our preliminary clinical findings showed that children with COVID usually presented with mild respiratory infections, as compared with adult cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. For pediatric patients, fever and mild cough are common symptoms at disease onset. For mild case, fever is brief and resolved rapidly. A few of patients presenting with/without cough also showed radiographic evidence of patchy infiltrate at symptom onset. In one study of a family cluster, an asymptomatic 10-year-old child infected with 2019-nCoV due to household exposure had radiological ground-glass lung opacities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Radiographic evidence of pneumonia was a characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection at the earliest stage of infection, thus, close observation is very necessary for a child with either mild symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. We don\u2019t recommend use of antiviral agents for the treatment of self-limited non-severe COVID because no evidence has shown the effectiveness of antiviral agents currently available. Influenza virus screening is necessary to rule out the possible coinfection considering the seasonal overlap between influenza and COVID. Empirical antibiotic initiation is not recommended for treatment of non-severe 2019-nCoV-associated pneumonia without evidence of superbacterial infection. By 22 January 2020, all notifiable COVID cases and severe cases were aged \u226715 years old in Wuhan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. In theory, children are also susceptible to 2019-nCoV and mild or atypical cases were largely underdiagnosed according to the initial screening criteria which focused on suspected pneumonia case [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].",
            "The epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that COVID can be transmitted from person to person and the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. We observed the mean number of secondary symptomatic cases in household exposure setting was 2.43. Our findings highly support the evidence of human-to-human transmission of COVID. All pediatric patients had an epidemiological link directly or indirectly to Wuhan or other endemic area of Hubei, where the outbreak of COVID originated and is ongoing. Most of pediatric cases occurring outside of Wuhan were secondary cases after exposure to adult cases through household contact or travel contact. However, we can not neglect the potential risk of transmission from the infected child to adult contacts, as shown in patient 7. Thus, personal medical protection is crucial when care providers look after the infected child. The major pattern of transmission was intrafamily transmission. The general transmission pattern of COVID is similar to that of SARS and MERS in children [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Based on our field investigation, the mean incubation period between household exposure to a symptomatic adult case and symptom onset was 6.5 days, longer than 5.4 days observed in adult cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. This difference could be suggestive of longer incubation period for 2019-nCoV infection in children. Currently, these epidemiological features are a key clue to help early recognition of 2019-nCoV infection in children outside of Wuhan and take infection prevention control interventions in time.",
            "Virus shedding in respiratory specimens is longer in children with mild COVID, which will impose a challenge for infection control. 2019-nCoV RNA was not detected in serum samples in our study. Viremia could be related to the severity of disease because 2019-nCoV RNA was detected in blood samples obtained from 15% of adult patients with pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Surprisingly, we also noted a high frequency (83.3%) of 2019-nCoV RNA detection in feces in mild patients and prolonged virus RNA shedding in feces for at least 2 weeks and even more than 1 month, which raises a question concerning whether the gastrointestinal tract may be another site of viral replication. The impact on 2019-nCoV shedding in feces on transmission model and infection prevention and control should be further assessed.",
            "The COVID epidemic is now spreading globally. Further research and surveillance are crucial to help us understand the clinical characteristics and natural history of 2019-nCoV infection in children."
