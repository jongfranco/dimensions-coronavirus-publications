        "EID PREPAREDNESS IS NEEDED": [
            "Two hundred years ago, fewer than one billion people inhabited the earth. Today there are over 7.6 billion (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWorldometers_2018_a\" href=\"#rWorldometers_2018_a\">Worldometers 2018</a>). This population explosion has necessitated extensive conversion of natural to urban landscapes and agricultural and livestock intensification to support growing human populations. These conversion activities bring wildlife, domestic animals and humans into closer and intensified contact with each other, increasing the likelihood of pathogen evolution, interspecies transmission and spillover of wild and domestic animal pathogens to humans (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDaszak_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rDaszak_et+al_2000_a\">Daszak et al 2000</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKaresh_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rKaresh_et+al_2005_a\">Karesh et al 2005</a>; Jones et al 2013). Changes wrought by global warming also play a significant role in pathogen evolution, transmission and spillover, as does expanding socio-economic connectivity\u2014both macro-scale impacts of expanding human populations and resource use. As a result of these global changes, EIDs are on the rise, threatening far-reaching populations (Jones et al 2008). The economic cost of an EID pandemic today, even in the absence of significant global mortality, is estimated to exceed tens of billions of US dollars (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPike_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rPike_et+al_2014_a\">Pike et al 2014</a>). Understanding the underlying human activities and ecological changes driving EIDs is paramount to preparing for outbreaks and reducing their economic and public health impacts (Barnosky et al 2012).",
            "The incidence of disease epidemics in wildlife, and pathogens spilling over from wildlife into humans, is increasing in countries where urbanization has recently or is currently occurring (Liu et al 2018; Hassell et al 2017). Human urbanization extends city boundaries and alters wildlife host community compositions, leading to biodiversity shifts and loss (Keesing et al 2010), disturbing the delicate balance between microbes and their natural wild animal reservoir hosts. Human urbanization also brings domesticated animals into closer contact with wild animals, providing opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission, as evidenced by recent outbreaks of canine distemper virus in giant pandas in China (Feng et al 2015; Jin et al 2017) and the introduction of feline leukemia virus in the Florida puma in the USA (Cunningham et al 2008). Changes in wildlife populations due to infectious disease outbreaks can have long-term serious consequences for ecosystem resilience. Disease outbreaks in wildlife may also result in direct infection of nearby human populations or changes in wildlife host population dynamics, leading to spillover of other pathogens to humans or domestic livestock (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDaszak_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rDaszak_et+al_2000_a\">Daszak et al 2000</a>). A prime example is the recent emergence of a novel coronavirus, SADS-CoV, from bats to pigs, resulting from pig farms encroaching on bat habitat, devastating several pig farms in Southern China and posing a major biosecurity risk to the USA (Luo et al 2018).",
            "The rise in intensive farming, particularly in China and the USA, also potentially creates conditions for selection of more virulent pathogens and greater opportunities for cross-species transmission (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMennerat_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rMennerat_et+al_2010_a\">Mennerat et al 2010</a>). China has recently experienced a rapid transformation from small-scale farms to large-scale livestock production enterprises. During 2018, pork production throughout China was estimated at 5404 tons, with the number of individual slaughtered hogs estimated at 693,820,000 (The National Bureau of Statistics 2018a). The number of slaughtered poultry in 2016 was estimated to be greater than 12.3 trillion (The National Bureau of Statistics 2018b). Such intensive production practices in China have contributed to outbreaks of influenza H5N1, H1N1, H7N9, and African Swine Fever viruses (Wei et al 2016; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2018_a\">Wang et al 2018</a>).

The USA is the largest importer, and China is the largest exporter of legally traded wild mammals (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCan_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rCan_et+al_2019_a\">Can et al 2019</a>) and while challenging to quantify, China is considered the leading country in the consumption and illegal trade of wildlife (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKaresh_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rKaresh_et+al_2005_a\">Karesh et al 2005</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPatel_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rPatel_et+al_2015_a\">Patel et al 2015</a>). Southern China is a hub for domestically and internationally imported and exported wildlife given its strategic geographic location near major ports of trade, dense human population and increasing human mobility. Local tradition also fuels consumption of wild animals in this region. In Guangdong province alone, there are more than 1300 enterprises engaged in wildlife breeding, of which approximately 600 breed wild animals regulated by CITES Appendix II. During 2001\u20132004, a total of 21 bird species (around 56 thousand individuals), 21 mammal species (*5400 individuals), 41 amphibious and reptile species (up to 346 tons) were raised and traded in Guangzhou, the most populous city in Guangdong Province. Communities engaged in this concentrated wildlife production and trade enterprise represent a valuable resource at the front lines of pathogen spillover and can be leveraged to understand and control the spread of zoonotic diseases.",
            "At a macro-scale, anthropogenic activities have influenced microbial transmission dynamics, particularly for vector-borne pathogens (Jones et al 2008; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGoklany_2009_a\" href=\"#rGoklany_2009_a\">Goklany 2009</a>; Woodward et al 2014; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMurray_2013_a\" href=\"#rMurray_2013_a\">Murray and Daszak 2013</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMorse_1995_a\" href=\"#rMorse_1995_a\">Morse 1995</a>). For example, climate variation has been documented to drive transmission of dengue virus dynamics in Guangdong, China (Liu et al 2018; Xu et al 2017; Sang et al 2014, 2015; Xiang et al 2017). This region experienced no outbreaks of dengue-like illness from the period of 1950\u20131977, followed by a relatively low level of incidence until a large-scale outbreak occurred in 2014, infecting over 45,000 people (Liu et al 2018). Similarly, climate change is projected to impact the distribution of vector-borne disease in the USA, with the environment being more suitable for the introduction of Zika virus in certain regions of the southeastern USA (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCarlson_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rCarlson_et+al_2018_a\">Carlson et al 2018</a>).

        "REQUIRED ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE": [
            "A holistic ecological and evolutionary process perspective is required to understand the risk of spillover and spread of pathogens in humans and animals (Alexander et al 2018). Pathogens are not fixed entities, and some pathogens carry a greater innate ability to evolve and spillover into new hosts than others (Johnson et al 2015; Olival et al 2017). Evaluation of pathogen evolution from initial spillover to establishment in the human population (e.g., simian immunodeficiency virus chimpanzee to human immunodeficiency virus; HIV-1) (Gao et al 1999) is critical to understanding why certain pathogens can establish and others cannot. Viral surveillance in \u2018\u2018real-time\u2019\u2019 is required to examine and track pathogen evolution. For example, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, designed to monitor the quickly evolving and recombining influenza virus in a timely manner, has served for over half a century as a global alert mechanism for the emergence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential (World Health Organization 2019a). Knowledge of ecological scenarios surrounding the accelerated viral evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is vital to preparing for future outbreaks of the disease in humans and worthy of significant investment in China and elsewhere (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGao_2018_a\" href=\"#rGao_2018_a\">Gao 2018</a>). Monitoring of viral evolution in similarly relevant time scales for other quickly evolving pathogens, such as coronaviruses, lags further behind and is an area of research with much needed additional attention. For example, recent evolutionary analyses of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus have helped to elucidate viral transmission dynamics between camels and people (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDudas_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rDudas_et+al_2018_a\">Dudas et al 2018</a>). We also now know that viruses sharing diverse vertebrate hosts are \u2018\u2018worth watching\u2019\u2019 for potential emergence in humans, because host breadth (i.e., infecting a taxonomically diverse range of hosts) is a key factor associated with a virus\u2019 likelihood of spillover and secondary human-to-human transmission and geographic spread (Johnson et al 2015; Olival et al 2017). Thus, expanding \u2018\u2018real-time\u2019\u2019 surveillance of such pathogens would be a worthwhile investment for public health.",
            "Analyzing epidemiological data using theory and methods from macroecology allows us to forecast impacts of ecological and environmental drivers on infectious disease incidence. Examples include how land cover and climate changes influence epidemics in wildlife (e.g., chytrid fungus, white-nose syndrome), livestock (e.g., foot-mouthdisease, African swine fever, bluetongue) and human (e.g., schistosomiasis, malaria) populations, as well as impact complete wildlife\u2013livestock\u2013human systems (e.g., avian influenza, tuberculosis) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cEstrada-Pena_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rEstrada-Pena_et+al_2014_a\">Estrada-Pena et al 2014</a>; Peterson",

Large-scale, high-resolution data on environmental and climatic factors and populations of humans and wildlife facilitate the creation of dynamic distribution models for infectious agents and can help prioritize research and control efforts (Cohen et al 2016; Carlson et al 2017). Collaborative research between China and the USA could greatly advance spatiotemporal disease prediction schemes because both countries encompass large climatic gradients, have high capacity for ecological and climatic data collection, and share some overlapping vectors, and zoonotic pathogens (Liu et al 2018; Estrada-Pena",

Three relevant case studies which are expanded upon below include: the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the SARS pandemic, and the emergence of amphibian chytridiomycosis.",
            "The first outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) outside of Central Africa demonstrated the importance of focusing on wildlife host and human ecological risk factors in advance of major disease outbreaks and the need for international collaboration in outbreak response (Fig. 2). Despite nearly 40 years of research since the first outbreak in 1976, including public investment of US$ 1.035 billion between 1997 and 2015 (Fitchett et al 2016), national and international public health agencies were caught off guard by the 2014 outbreak in West Africa (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKamradt-Scott_2016_a\" href=\"#rKamradt-Scott_2016_a\">Kamradt-Scott 2016</a>) that resulted in 28,600 cases with more than 11,300 deaths (WHO Ebola Response Team et al 2016). Evidence from humans and wildlife indicating the distribution of Ebola virus (species Zaire ebolavirus) in West Africa existed prior to this health crisis. Distribution and migration patterns of the hammer-headed fruit bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus), little collared fruit bat (Myoncycteris torquata), straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) (Leroy et al 2005), Franquet\u2019s epauletted fruit bat (Epomops franqueti) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOlival_2014_a\" href=\"#rOlival_2014_a\">Olival and Hayman 2014</a>) and the greater long-fingered bat (Miniopterus inflatus) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKupferschmidt_2018_a\" href=\"#rKupferschmidt_2018_a\">Kupferschmidt 2018</a>), species implicated as reservoir hosts for Ebola virus, were known to extend into West Africa with opportunities for spread of the virus. Human serological exposure also indicated a wider geographical range for ebolaviruses including Guinea (Boiro et al 1987), Liberia (Van der Waals et al 1986) and Sierra",

During this outbreak, China and the USA collaborated together for the first time in an international health emergency outside of their borders, which constituted China\u2019s largest ever humanitarian mission in addressing a public health emergency of international concern (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_2017_a\" href=\"#rHuang_2017_a\">Huang 2017</a>). Twenty-four of the Chinese public health experts who were deployed to Africa were graduates of, or residents in, the Chinese Field Epidemiology Training Program (CFETP) established by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Centers for Disease Control 2016). Also, the Chinese government sent 115 military medical professionals to Sierra Leone to work along with US medical personnel to assist with infection prevention and control, clinical care and health promotion and training (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLu_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rLu_et+al_2016_a\">Lu et al 2016</a>). Further investment from China and the USA in working together on response efforts will undoubtedly be mutually beneficial for pathogens of importation concern. Efforts toward unraveling the disease ecology of ebolaviruses\u2014including a better understanding of the ecology of reservoir host(s), the role of secondary spillover hosts, as well as human behaviors surrounding exposure\u2014is also needed and would benefit exponentially from a China\u2013US collaborative effort.",
            "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic caused by a novel zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was the first pandemic of the twenty-first century and spread to more than 30 countries (Fig. 2). Initial isolation of SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) from masked palm civets and the detection of SARS-CoV infection, in humans working at wet markets selling these animals in Guangdong Province, suggested that masked palm civets could serve as a source of human infection (Guan et al 2003). Subsequently, SARSr-CoVs were detected in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) and provided strong evidence that bats are the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (Ge et al 2013; Li et al 2005; Yang et al 2015). Through long-term human and wildlife surveillance, investigators from China and the USA subsequently found that bats carry a diverse range of SARSr-CoVs (Ge et al 2013; Li et al 2005; Yang et al 2015; Lau et al 2005; Drexler et al 2010; Yuan et al 2010; He et al 2014; Wu et al 2016; Hu et al 2017), extending as far as Yunnan Province, and some of them can directly infect humans without intermediate hosts (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2018_a\">Wang et al 2018</a>). While it is unknown whether the SARS outbreak could have been preempted with this knowledge, the joint efforts of China and the USA to rapidly determine where, how and when the virus was spilling over and what human behaviors and populations were at greatest risk for infection may have reduced the severity of the outbreak and will help in mitigating future spillover events. The SARS outbreak was a prime example of the importance of contextualizing epidemiologically notable human behaviors in social, economic and cultural systems in order to decipher causality of an EID.",
            "Pandemic diseases in wild animals (epizootics) can also result in devastating impacts to a country\u2019s biodiversity and natural resources. For example, amphibian chytridiomycosis, caused by the novel pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is responsible for massive losses of biodiversity to an entire Class of organisms (Amphibians). The global pandemic lineage of the pathogen originated in Eastern Asia (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOstfeld_2012_a\" href=\"#rOstfeld_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOstfeld_2012_a\" href=\"#rOstfeld_2012_a\">Ostfeld and Keesing 2012</a></a>) and disseminated through human trade and transportation (O\u2019Hanlon et al 2018) into the biodiverse areas of Australia and the Neotropics. The lack of demographic studies, combined with limited population estimates in the IUCN Red List prior to this pandemic, made it difficult to understand the scope of the disease. A better understanding of wildlife population dynamics before massive declines occur is essential to better understanding biodiversity\u2019s impact on EIDs and what elements of biodiversity disease theory (Fig. 2) apply (Jones et al 2008; Keesing et al 2010; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMurray_2013_a\" href=\"#rMurray_2013_a\">Murray and Daszak 2013</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMorse_1995_a\" href=\"#rMorse_1995_a\">Morse 1995</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOstfeld_2012_a\" href=\"#rOstfeld_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOstfeld_2012_a\" href=\"#rOstfeld_2012_a\">Ostfeld and Keesing 2012</a></a>; Civitello et al 2015). Interestingly, another fungal pathogen, white-nose syndrome (WNS), which has decimated bat populations in the USA, may also have an Asian or Eurasian origin because it has been found on bats in Northern China (Hoyt et al 2016). Recent studies suggest that the systemic effects of WNS may down-regulate antiviral responses in bats persistently infected with coronaviruses and increase the potential of virus shedding (Davy et al 2018). Thus, a pathogen predominantly infecting wildlife may additionally have cascading effects on spillover of other pathogens of significance for human health."

Based on experience detecting and responding to national epidemics such as SARS, and influenza H5N1, H1N9 and H7N9, China has expanded their efforts to assist with diagnostics and surveillance in the region; they are a participant in the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Network (Phommasack et al 2013) and committed to promoting the prevention and control of communicable diseases and public health emergency response through ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)\u2013China health cooperation (Association of Southeast Asian Nations 2018).

China and the USA have a long history of collaboration, have the two largest economies in the world with significant resources for investment in global health, the largest current combined investment in infrastructure for infectious disease research, and have the skill sets necessary for advancing disease prevention and response. China and the USA first signed a Protocol for Cooperation in the Science and Technology of Medicine and Public Health in the 1970s (Obamawhitehouse.gov. 2018).

A search of the Web of Science (August 15, 2018: see supplementary information for details) revealed that from 2000\u20132007, 43% of publications on ecology/environment that included disease/pathogens were authored by US researchers exclusive of Chinese participation, while only 2.2% were authored by Chinese researchers exclusive of US participation. These figures changed to 36% and 8%, respectively, from 2010 to 2017. If this trend continues into the next decade (2020\u20132027), then under a linear extrapolation we can expect the USA and China to publish around 30% and 15% of ecological and evolutionary infectious disease-related research (Fig. 3). Together, the USA and China have published half of the world\u2019s ecological and evolutionary infectious disease-related research. Despite these trends, and while around 45% of all published disease research is undertaken within the USA and China, integrated scientific studies with strong ecological and evolutionary components are largely missing."

        "PROPOSED NEXT STEPS": [
            "diseases (World Health Organization 2019b), and two OIE collaborating centers with research focused on food-borne parasites and zoonoses (World Organization for Animal Health 2019). A strong emphasis on leading edge technology for molecular diagnostics and pathogen characterization has made China a leader in the field of virology and biotechnology (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cEllis_2018_a\" href=\"#rEllis_2018_a\">Ellis 2018</a>), including investment in the state-of-the-art pathogen isolation and identification technologies such as high-throughput sequencing. In January 2018, for the first time, China overtook the USA in terms of total number of scientific publications, according to statistics compiled by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTollefson_2018_a\" href=\"#rTollefson_2018_a\">Tollefson 2018</a>).",
            "While current investments from the USA and China have built a foundation for better disease surveillance in humans and animals around the world, an investment in training in disease ecology with an emphasis on critical thinking remains a missing link. A key observation identified by us during the recent US\u2013China workshops was that Chinese infectious disease research has a strong emphasis on biology, biotechnology, genomics, virology and public health surveillance at the expense of research into the spatial/geographic, social/cultural, transmission and ecological components needed to develop models to guide policies for controlling zoonoses and other outbreaks. This technologyoriented bias in research at the cost of a broader social and ecological understanding of disease systems can result in an intellectual trap where developing countries continue to depend on external ecological and environmental systemslevel expertise critical to managing outbreaks. In addition, with the explosion of bioinformatics related research in the USA, it is important that the USA not lose sight of the fundamental importance of foundational training in ecological understanding. Future investments in training in the fields of disease ecology, eco-evolutionary dynamics, study design in natural systems, disease modeling and complex data analysis are essential for China\u2014as it is no less for other Asian and sub-Saharan Africa countries\u2014to take a lead role in their own disease investigations and to contribute toward global health security as equal partners.",
            "An investment in human capacity for critical thinking regarding infectious diseases involves extending ecological and analytical training in less developed countries, where pathogens are most likely to emerge\u2014moving beyond efforts limited to field sampling and pathogen detection. The UN China One Health Event held in 2011 emphasized the importance of problem-based as opposed to disciplinary learning to achieve these goals (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFearnley_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rFearnley_et+al_2019_a\">Fearnley et al 2019</a>). This is the critical next step toward fully collaborative EID preparedness programs, so that capacity strengthening can be focused on preparing in-country teams for designing their own outbreak investigations, conducting their own human and wildlife disease ecology surveys, and taking a more active role at every step of the scientific process involved with understanding EIDs and responding to outbreaks. Significant challenges exist to accomplishing this holistic training approach, when in-country tertiary science education has not produced sufficient research groups able to carry out the needed research. China is the logical next step for the global health community\u2019s major investment in disease ecology training, given its well-developed scientific infrastructure, current investments in basic science, virology and biotechnology, and national interest to contribute to global EID initiatives.",
            "New approaches are needed to integrate ecological training and accelerate EID preparedness. These include broadening data collection to reduce uncertainties and improving analytical techniques to identify regions at highest risk for EIDs, as well as strengthening public health infrastructures in these locations to reduce the number of outbreaks. The application of novel analytical approaches to address these critical needs has been conflated by academic debate on whether or not EID prediction is possible (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGeoghegan_2017_a\" href=\"#rGeoghegan_2017_a\">Geoghegan and Holmes 2017</a>). While we currently do not have the ability to accurately forecast the time and location of the next EID outbreak, existing predictive models have been instrumental in prioritizing efforts. These include focusing on: sub-national regions (Allen et al 2017; Jones et al 2008); underlying environmental drivers (Allen et al 2017; Johnson et al 2015); specific reservoir host species (Olival et al 2017); and pathogen traits (Olival et al 2017; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFearnley_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rFearnley_et+al_2019_a\">Fearnley et al 2019</a>) that facilitate spillover (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCarlson_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rCarlson_et+al_2018_a\">Carlson et al 2018</a>). With a larger investment in disease ecology training in countries likely to be hot spots for EIDs, we can create the next generation of modeling and analytical techniques that incorporate more robust input from EID source nations.",
            "Substantial decadal-long US\u2013China joint funding mechanisms for integrated multidisciplinary EEID research projects are also needed to accomplish cross-training and meet research objectives discussed above. Efforts toward this mission have been limited because of unwillingness of traditional funders to redirect resources across sectors and expand out of siloed missions (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMazet_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rMazet_et+al_2016_a\">Mazet et al 2016</a>). Diseaserelated research focused on medical or genetic components at the point of human infection and spread has received much more funding than that with an ecological health focus, aiming to describe the environmental or host community scenarios facilitating initial spillover of a pathogen to humans, or the impact of biodiversity loss on human health (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOstfeld_2017_a\" href=\"#rOstfeld_2017_a\">Ostfeld 2017</a>; Cardinale et al 2012). An important step in the right direction was the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases (EEID) program through the NSF\u2019s announcement in August 2018, of the addition of the National Natural Science Foundation of China as a new international collaborative partner. Through a relatively modest government investment of $275 million USD (including contributions from foreign partners) since 2000, this program has funded over 150 individual projects and led to some key discoveries that have greatly advanced our understanding and prediction of EID spillover, amplification and spread (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLloyd-Smith_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rLloyd-Smith_et+al_2005_a\">Lloyd-Smith et al 2005</a>; Kilpatrick et al 2006; Gilbert et al 2008; Chiu et al 2019; Lee et al 2017; Carver et al 2016; Coffey et al 2008). Continuation of this program and further collaborative funding efforts between the USA and China are needed.",
            "With the burgeoning world population and dramatically increased movements of individuals, the potential for a disease outbreak to cause the death of hundreds of millions of individuals is now a reality. Only a deep understanding of disease from an ecological systems point of view, taking into account every scale of a pathogen\u2019s life cycle, can avert the increasing number of catastrophes in waiting. Very often it is information on disease ecology that is missing from programs purporting to take a One Health approach. Without the scientific and funding support of China and the USA in addressing the ecological components of disease systems through engagement of researchers and health practitioners from every part of the globe, we will continue to remain dangerously naive of how best to confront the threat of pandemic disease."
