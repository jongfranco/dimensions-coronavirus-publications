In West China Hospital, Emergency Department (ED) undertook the mission of clinical reception, primary diagnosis, and interim treatment for the suspected cases of COVID-19.",
            "The pathogen of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, was confirmed to have human-to-human transmission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Therefore, COVID-19 has expanded the infection risk from Wuhan to cities throughout China and even the world via case transportation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] Providing qualified personal protection equipment (PPE) to healthcare personnel plays an essential role in avoiding occupational exposure and infection. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for COVID-19 infection control of healthcare personnel recommended gloves, gowns, respiratory protection, and eye protection as standardized PPE.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] However, protective clothing, N95 respirators, and goggles are not commonly used in clinical practice, and hence are not in bulk stock. This brief report aims to present our interim hospital management measures on the healthcare personnel protection in West China Hospital under the condition of intense workload and PPE supply shortage after the outbreak of COVID-19.",
            "First, the online clinic was set to facilitate the patient triage (Figure 1C). Through free online consultation, the hospital preliminarily judged the treatment urgency, recommended non-emergency patients to delay hospital appointments or visit other non-anti-epidemic hospitals, provided low-suspected patients treatment instruction when self-isolating at home, invited high-suspected patients to the Fever Clinic via the green channel. The online clinic effectively alleviated the ED workload and facilitated early detection of potential cases.",
            "Second, the interim visit triage and ED region separation were established (Figure 1D). The assigned personnel conducted pre-examination and triage to divide visits into low-suspected, high-suspected, and other patients, and required different patients to follow the specified routines to enter ED and separate the intra-ED space into high-risk and low-risk regions. For suspected cases, the hospital assigned an independent Fever Clinic Room, Fever Observation Room, and CT Examination Room. Cases confirmed through qRT-PCR and/or CT were transferred to Quarantine Ward while excluded patients went to other departments or back home. The ED region separation triage system reduced the cross-infection by restricting the activity ranges of both patients and ED personnel.",
            "Our hospital adopted interim measures, including online consultation, region separation, and epidemic priority, to alleviate the pressure in the clinical work, reduce the cross-infection, and strengthen the protection of high-risk staff. Our hospital held the \u201czero infection\u201d record, which was far lower than the simultaneous outside-Hubei mean level of 3.4% in late January.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] The zero infection indicated the flexibility and validity of our interim hospital management strategy.",
            "However, there were still some limitations. First, the supply protocol compromised the health protection of low-risk personnel without standardized PPE. Second, the interim management strategies could not resist large-scale outbreak and long-term PPE shortage. Nevertheless, our management strategies, as a temporary emergency plan, created the biggest benefits of extremely limited resources to meet the emergency need. The long-term solution should be a sustainable supply chain. Fortunately, the government of China recovered the PPE production supply in February, which alleviated the supply shortage significantly.",
            "In conclusion, the hospital emergency management plan of West China Hospital could alleviate the ED workload, protect healthcare personnel, and control the cross-infection during the COVID-19 epidemic. We advocate that every hospital should create the contingency plan suited to their conditions."
