        "abstract": "From the beginning of 2002 and 2012, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) crossed the species barriers to infect humans caused thousands of infections and hundreds of deaths, respectively. Currently, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes the outbreaks of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered. Until February 18, 2020, there are 72533 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 10644 severe cases) and 1872 deaths in China. SARS-CoV-2 is surging in the public and caused substantial burdens due to its human-to-human transmission. However, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. Finding the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to prevent further spread of the epidemic. In this study, we used systematic comparison and analysis to predict the interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of coronavirus spike protein and the host receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interaction between the key amino acids of S protein RBD and ACE2 indicated that like previous suggested pangolins and snacks, the turtles (C. picta bellii, C. mydas, and P. sinensis) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to human. Keywords: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2); Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S); SARS-CoV-2.",

            "Phylogenetic reconstruction determines the evolutionary relationship and host selection between spike glycoproteins in the human-close beta coronaviruses. To better understand the host selection of beta coronaviruses, the relationship of spike glycoprotein between SARS-CoV-2 and other closely beta coronaviruses has been analyzed. The result showed that bat SARS-like CoV RaTG13, with 96.2% overall genome sequence identity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], is an inner joint neighbor of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2). In October 2019, it was reported that Sendai virus and Coronavirus were the dominant viruses in the virome data of Malayan pangolins[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV was the most widely distributed coronavirus in the pangolin samples. We blasted the SARS-CoV-2 reads and found that the spike protein sequence was in pangolin SARSlike CoV (numbered SRR10168377 here). While the S protein in pangolin SARS-like CoV SRR10168377 (marked as red star) only possess 75% identity with SARS-CoV2, partly because there were more than 220 residues in the S2 subunit had not been read in the virome data. Removing the lost sequences, there was still 88% identity with SARS-CoV-2 (Data not shown), the full-length sequence of spike protein between pangolin SARS-like CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seems to be a little different. The temporal tree showed the divergence time of spike sequence between bat SARS-like RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 is 0.18, while it is 1.50 form bat SARS-like RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2 cluster (Fig. S1).",
            "Global expansion and deep sequencing work have led to an increase amount of SARS-CoV-2 genotype. Studying selective stress may be helpful for assessing the variability and potential for host changes of SARS-CoV-2. Based on a report accord[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], the selective pressure analysis showed that genes (ORF10 and ORF7a) have a greater selective pressure, and Spike has an average pressure relative to the whole genome (Fig. S2). The spike RBD-receptor interaction is a key factor determining the host range of coronaviruses. The RBD sequences of spike protein from SARS-CoV, bat or pangolin SARS-like CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were aligned (Fig. 3). There are some deletions from 473 to 490 residues in Bat SARS-like CoV, which located in the external subdomain and seems to determine these viruses do not infect humans naturally, given that there has no direct evidence showing that Bat SARS-like CoV has ever infects human. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence from 329\u2013521 possess 93% identity with Pangolin SARS-like CoV SRR10168377, which is higher than the 89% identity with bat SARS-like CoV RaTG13 (Fig. 3). Pangolin SARS-like CoV SRR10168377 has only 85% identity with bat SARS-like CoV RaTG13, indicating that if focusing on only the spike RBD, pangolin SARS-like CoV SRR10168377 has a higher probability to cross host barriers and infect human.",

To understand the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding with ACE2, the structure of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was simulated (Fig. 4A). The difference of whole structure of spike protein between SARS-CoV-2 (red) and SARS-CoV (green) has been alimented, the coverage of the threading alignment is 0.83 (the number of aligned residues divided by the full-length protein) and normalized Z-score of the threading alignment is 6.27 (>1 mean a good alignment). The external subdomain in RBD has also been identified. The interaction model of SARS-CoV-2 with human ACE2 was then calculated by the PRISM 2.0 database (Fig. 4B), which was generally similar with the structure of SARS-CoV S protein binding with human receptor ACE2 (Fig. 4C). Based on our results and two recent reports[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], we noticed that SARS-CoV-2 numbering S protein may bind to ACE2 through Leu[455], Phe[486], Gln[493], Asn[501], and Tyr[505], only quartier is same as SARS-CoV.

At the residue position of 82 in mouse receptor, asparagine of bat (R. pearsonii) ACE2 may disrupt the interaction with Leu[472] of SARS-CoV RBD by steric interference hydrophobic contact[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>], while Met[82] in human receptor may interact with position 472 of RBD. Residues K479 and S487 in civet SARS-CoV can effectively recognize civet ACE2, but much less efficiently bind with human ACE226. The residue Thr[487] in RBD binds to Tyr[41] and Lys[353] in human ACE2 by van der Waals contacts[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>], and threonine at position 487 enhanced the affinity of most RBDs for civet and human ACE226. Residues in positions 479 and 487 in SARS-CoV correspond to the sites 493 and 501 in SARS-CoV-2 respectively. Residues Tyr[493] and Asp[501] in bat SARS-like Cov RaTG13 were replaced with Gln[493] and Asn[501] in SARS-CoV-2 respectively, same as pangolin SARS-like CoV SRR10168377.",
            "Consistent with SARS-CoV binding to human ACE2, the residues 31, 41, 82, 353, 355, and 357 on the receptor locate in the interface when interacting with SARSCoV-2 spike protein (Fig. 4B, C). More than 5 substitutions were observed in the turtles (C. picta bellii, C. mydas and P. sinensis), pangolin (M. javanica), and bats (both R.sinicus and R. pearsonii) receptors in contrast to the theoretical infectionpermissive species, such as human, gorilla, and macaca (Table 1). Mouse and dog also have multiple (\u22655) substitutions while cat and hamster only contain 3 mutations in the region. It was showed that Lys[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], Tyr[41], and Lys[353] mutations substantially interfere with the S1\u2010Ig association[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. It is noteworthy that at position 41 all maintain tyrosine in all observed species expect bats (both R. sinicus and R. pearsonii) substituted by histidine; at position 353 all maintain lysine expect mouse containing His[353]. At the position 31, turtle receptor contains glutamine or glutamic acid and mouse receptor contains asparagine, other observed species all maintain lysine same as human. Substitution of His[353] with Lys[353] in mouse ACE2 allows SARS-CoV infecting murine cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], indicating the importance of residue Lys[353] binding with receptor. In addition, considering the function of position 41 in the interaction with receptor, tyrosine may possess higher affinity with Asn[501] of RBD than histidine. From this perspective of Asn[501] in RBD domain with the sites 41 and 353 of ACE2 receptor, it seems that turtles and pangolins are closer to humans than bat, indicating turtles and pangolins may be the potential expanded hosts of SARS-CoV-2. The structural basis underlying this observed difference remains to be illustrated."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "Knowing the structural binding mechanism will support to find the accurate virus reservoirs and facilitate prevention countermeasure development. The crystallization of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was urgently analyzed by cryo-electron microscopy[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], it helps to verify the interfacing sites in the interaction between SARSCoV-2 spike RBD and human ACE2 or other hosts\u2019 receptors. It has reported that the binding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2 is much stronger than that of SARS-CoV15, which indicts that there are more intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Pangolin SARS-like CoV SRR10168377 seems to point the host range of SARSCoV-2 expanded from pangolin. It is current known that turtle also act as the virus reservoir carry more than dozens of viruses, including Ranavirus (RV), Nidovirus (NV), Papillomavirus (PV), Soft-shelled turtle iridovirus (STIV), Soft-shelled turtle systemic septicemia spherical virus (STSSSV), Tortoise picornavirus (ToPV), and Trionyx sinensis hemorrhagic syndrome virus (TSHSV)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. It does not exclude that bat SARS-like CoV RaTG13 or other SARS-like CoV infect turtle and expand to humans after evolution.",
            "From SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, all point to bats as the natural host of coronaviruses, but the intermediate hosts are all different. Previous findings suggested that snake is a probable wildlife animal reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 based on its RSCU bias resembling snake compared to other animals[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Civets and dromedary, as the intermediate hosts of zoonotic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, living in different time and space environments, they nevertheless transmitted the coronaviruses to human, this makes it difficult to find the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 in short-term. Analysis of the viral receptor binding sequences and host receptors helps to quickly target the possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Compared to the illegally traded pangolins, turtles at the markets are more common and popular. This study provides information and possibilities that like snacks and pangolins, the turtles (C. picta bellii, C. mydas, and P. sinensis) may also act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to human, although much more need to be confirmed."
