        "abstract": "To investigate the genetic diversity, time origin, and evolutionary history of the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak in China and Thailand, a total of 12 genome sequences of the virus with known sampling date (24 December 2019 and 13 January 2020) and geographic location (primarily Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, but also Bangkok, Thailand) were analyzed. Phylogenetic and likelihood\u2010mapping analyses of these genome sequences were performed. On the basis of our results, the star\u2010like signal and topology of 2019\u2010nCoV may be indicative of potentially large \u201cfirst generation\u201d human\u2010to\u2010human virus transmission. We estimated that 2019\u2010nCoV likely originated in Wuhan on 9 November 2019 (95% credible interval: 25 September 2019 and 19 December 2019), and that Wuhan is the major hub for the spread of the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak in China and elsewhere. Our results could be useful for designing effective prevention strategies for 2019\u2010nCoV in China and beyond.",

Authorities in China and around the world have mounted an enormous operation to track and screen travelers from Wuhan in central China, where the first cases were documented. As of 26 January 2020, there have been 2744 cases of 2019\u2010nCoV confirmed in mainland China, including 80 deaths, 461 serious, and 51 discharged, as well as 8 in Hong Kong, 5 in Macao, and 4 in Taiwan.

            "From the 12 genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV, which included the city of origin and date of sampling, our likelihood\u2010mapping analysis confirmed that this novel virus has spread rapidly, indicating that the scale of transmission may be large given the virus spillover from an animal reservoir to humans and high secondary human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. On the basis of the confirmation from Professor Zhong, who is leading the government's expert panel on the outbreak, 14 healthcare workers appear to have been infected by one person who carried the virus. This suggests that epidemic super\u2010spreaders may have been generated at the very beginning of the outbreak and occurred once this novel coronavirus jumped from animals to humans. In addition, as mass travel for the Chinese New Year holiday could spread this virus farther and faster, it is critical to understand the Wuhan 2019\u2010nCOV outbreak and predict how easily the virus can transmit between humans and whether the outbreak has the potential to persist. On the basis of our time scale phylogenetic analysis of 12 genome sequences, the observed lack or limited diversity of the 2019\u2010nCOV strains suggests that the common ancestor of this virus in humans possibly occurred on 9 November 2019.<br/><br/>However, we acknowledge that the estimates presented here relate only to a limited number of 2019\u2010nCOV genome sequences and our results are estimated with some uncertainty. Therefore, our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution. As the outbreak continues, it is possible that the addition of new sequences to our analyses could change the above results significantly. The generation of additional genomic datasets from Wuhan, as well as other regions of China and beyond, and from humans and animals that have transmitted 2019\u2010nCOV, will help clarify the extent of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission and identify the genetic changes that allowed this virus to jump species. Future studies should include comparative analyses of between\u2010host and within\u2010host transmission of 2019\u2010nCOV, and finer\u2010scale epidemiology to elucidate the transmission dynamics of different hosts through time and"

This strain was the first released 2019\u2010nCoV genome sequence but has since been updated three times. In this study, we used the latest version (MN908947.3), and therefore the genome sequence of strain BetaCoV/Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101/2019 from GISAID (EPI_ISL_402125) was excluded. Isolate BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC\u2010HB\u2010 04/2020 (EPI_ISL_402120) shows evidence of sequencing artifacts and thus was also excluded in this study. The final dataset included 12 genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV with known sampling date and city (10 from individuals in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, with samples collected between 24 and 30 December 2019, and two from Chinese individuals in Bangkok, Thailand, who had recently traveled from Wuhan, with samples collected between 8 and 13 January 2020) (Table S1). For this dataset, the 2019\u2010nCoV genome sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.22216 and then manually curated using BioEdit v7.2.5.17",
            "To study the amount of evolutionary information contained in the dataset, likelihood\u2010mapping analysis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] was performed using TREE\u2010PUZZLE v5.3,19 with 30 000 randomly chosen quartets for the entire tree. For each sequence quartet, three unrooted tree topologies are possible. For a random sample of quartets, the likelihoods for the three possible topologies are reported as dots in an equilateral triangle. The distribution of points in different sections of this triangle indicates the tree\u2010 likeness of the data: the three corners represent fully resolved tree topologies, indicating the presence of a tree\u2010like phylogenetic signal; the center represents the sets of points where all three trees are equally supported, indicating a star\u2010like phylogenetic signal; and the three areas on the sides indicate support for conflicting tree topologies. To infer phylogeny, we used the maximum\u2010likelihood approach with the Hasegawa\u2010Kishino\u2010Yano nucleotide substitution model with gamma\u2010 distributed rate variation among sites (HKY+G) in PhyML v3.1.20 Support for the inferred relationships was determined by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of 2019\u2010 nCoV, we used Bayesian inference through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework implemented in BEAST v1.8.4,21 with the BEAGLE library v2.1.222 used to increase computational performance. As no temporal signal was present in the dataset, we employed HKY+G, as well as a constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock model assuming an evolutionary rate of 4.59 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions per site per year to estimate the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for this dataset based on previous genetic analysis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] We also placed a log\u2010normal prior (mean = 4.59 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions per site per year, 95% Bayesian credible interval: 1.178 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year) on the evolutionary rate with a strict molecular clock model based on previous studies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] To ensure adequate mixing of model parameters, MCMC chains were run for 100 million steps with sampling every 10 000 steps from the posterior distribution. Convergence was evaluated by calculating the effective sample sizes of the parameters using Tracer v1.7.1.27 Trees were summarized as maximum clade credibility trees using TreeAnnotator after discarding the first 10% as burn\u2010in, and then visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).",
            "To perform ancestral reconstruction of the unobserved sampling locations (k = 2), discrete phylogeographic analyses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] were performed using the empirical tree distributions generated for our 2019\u2010 nCoV dataset. The location exchange process was modeled using asymmetric continuous\u2010time Markov chains (CTMC)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] with an approximate CTMC conditional reference prior to the overall rate scaler and a uniform prior distribution. Bayesian analysis was run using BEAST v1.8.421 and BEAGLE library v2.1.222 for an MCMC chain of 100 million iterations, with 10 000 samples of all parameters and 10 000 trees for our dataset.",
            "allow CTMC rates to shrink to zero with some probability, using BEAST v1.8.4.21 Strongly supported rates of virus movement (Bayes factor > 10) were identified using SpreaD3 v0.9.6.29",
            "The dataset included 12 genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV strains from Wuhan, China (n = 10), with sampling dates between 24 and 30 December 2019, and from Bangkok, Thailand (n = 2), with sampling date between 8 and 13 January 2020 (Table S1). The samples were primarily from Wuhan (83.33%), which is also the city of the original 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak.",
            "To identify a subset of well\u2010supported migration events among 2019\u2010 nCoV strains, we used a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection procedure with a hierarchical prior on location indicators (0\u20101), which",
            "For this dataset, our likelihood\u2010mapping analysis revealed a strong star\u2010 like topology signal (Figure 1), indicating very limited genetic diversity for 2019\u2010nCoV as of now. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the 12 genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV also showed a lack of genetic diversity, in accordance with the likelihood\u2010mapping analysis (Figure 2). The correlation between sampling date and divergence to the root of",
            "Our phylogeographic analysis revealed that the most probable root location of the 2019\u2010nCoV ancestor was in Wuhan, China (posterior probability = 0.98) (Figure 4). Our results also revealed that Wuhan acted as a diffusion epicenter compared to Bangkok. Most viral transmissions between epidemiologically linked cities were from Wuhan to Bangkok (mean estimate 1.96; 95% credible interval: 0.99\u20102.42; Bayes factor = 1631)."
        ],
        "4 | DISCUSSION": [
            "From the 12 genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV, which included the city of origin and date of sampling, our likelihood\u2010mapping analysis confirmed that this novel virus has spread rapidly, indicating that the scale of transmission may be large given the virus spillover from an animal reservoir to humans and high secondary human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. On the basis of the confirmation from Professor Zhong, who is leading the government's expert panel on the outbreak, 14 healthcare workers appear to have been infected by one person who carried the virus. This suggests that epidemic super\u2010spreaders may have been generated at the very beginning of the outbreak and occurred once this novel coronavirus jumped from animals to humans. In addition, as mass travel for the Chinese New Year holiday could spread this virus farther and faster, it is critical to understand the Wuhan 2019\u2010nCOV outbreak and predict how easily the virus can transmit between humans and whether the outbreak has the potential to persist. On the basis of our time scale phylogenetic analysis of 12 genome sequences, the observed lack or limited diversity of the 2019\u2010nCOV strains suggests that the common ancestor of this virus in humans possibly occurred on 9 November 2019.",
            "However, we acknowledge that the estimates presented here relate only to a limited number of 2019\u2010nCOV genome sequences and our results are estimated with some uncertainty. Therefore, our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution. As the outbreak continues, it is possible that the addition of new sequences to our analyses could change the above results significantly. The generation of additional genomic datasets from Wuhan, as well as other regions of China and beyond, and from humans and animals that have transmitted 2019\u2010nCOV, will help clarify the extent of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission and identify the genetic changes that allowed this virus to jump species. Future studies should include comparative analyses of between\u2010host and within\u2010host transmission of 2019\u2010nCOV, and finer\u2010scale epidemiology to elucidate the transmission dynamics of different hosts through time and",
            "Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of using likelihood\u2010mapping and phylogenetic analyses to provide insights into the origin, evolutionary history, and spread of 2019\u2010nCOV over a short time scale. These efforts, combined with epidemiological investigations, are needed to track changes in the 2019\u2010nCOV epidemic. Understanding these epidemic dynamics in real\u2010time is increasingly important for public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts."

        "As mass travel for the Chinese New Year holiday could spread this virus farther and faster, it is critical to understand the Wuhan 2019\u2010nCOV outbreak and predict how the virus can transmit between humans and whether the outbreak has the potential to persist",
        "On the basis of our time scale phylogenetic analysis of 12 genome sequences, the observed lack or limited diversity of the 2019\u2010nCOV strains suggests that the common ancestor of this virus in humans possibly occurred on 9 November 2019"
