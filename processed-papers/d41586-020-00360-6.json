            "A European mission that will take the closest-ever pictures of the Sun and give scientists their first clear look at the star\u2019s uncharted poles launched on 9 February.",

            "\u201cNobody has been able to take images this close to the Sun before,\u201d says Helen O\u2019Brien at Imperial College London, who manages the magnetometer instrument on the European Space Agency (ESA) mission, which also involves NASA. \u201cWe should see some beautiful images.\u201d",

            "The spacecraft (pictured on the left in this artist\u2019s impression) will be placed into an orbit that will bring it, at its closest, just 42 million kilometres, or 0.28 astronomical units, from the Sun (1 au is the distance between Earth and the Sun). It will take about two years to reach this orbit.",
            "The Solar Orbiter\u2019s main science phase will begin in November 2021 and last for four years. But if the mission is extended, as ESA scientists hope it will be, the craft would enter a second phase, which would allow it to image the Sun\u2019s poles. Over several years, mission controllers would raise the angle of the spacecraft\u2019s orbit above the plane of the planets and up and over the Sun.",
            "\u201cThat will give us the first-ever views of the solar poles,\u201d says Daniel M\u00fcller, a solar physicist at ESA\u2019s European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, who is the project scientist on the mission. \u201cWe believe that is key to better understanding the Sun\u2019s magnetic activity cycle.\u201d A previous mission, ESA and NASA\u2019s Ulysses spacecraft, flew over the poles in the 1990s and 2000s \u2014 but it had no cameras.",
            "Excitement over the creation of Colombia\u2019s first Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation has given way to anger and confusion over the appointment of Mabel Torres as science minister. The mycologist from the Technological University of El Choc\u00f3 in Quibd\u00f3 has made public claims about the cancer-fighting properties of a mushroom extract that she makes herself.",

But the treatment was not given under the auspices of a clinical trial, the methodology was not approved by a medical-ethics committee, and Torres has not submitted the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Critics want her to resign; one fears that her appointment might embolden people peddling unproven medical treatments.",

            "Two researchers at the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou have suggested that pangolins \u2014 long-snouted mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine \u2014 are the probable animal source of the coronavirus outbreak causing global alarm.",
            "Shen Yongyi and Xiao Lihua reported at a press conference on 7 February that they had identified the pangolin as the potential source of the coronavirus, on the basis of a genetic comparison of coronaviruses taken from the animals and from infected humans.",
            "Scientists have already suggested that the virus originally came from bats, because of the similarity of its genetic sequence to those of other known coronaviruses, but the pathogen was probably transmitted to humans by another animal.",

            "NASA could see a 12% increase to its US$22.6-billion budget under a proposal released by US President Donald Trump on 10 February. As science agencies go, however, it is an outlier. The budget request, which covers all areas of government, cuts deeply across most research spending for the 2021 fiscal year, which begins on 1 October 2020.",
            "The proposal includes $38.7 billion for the US National Institutes of Health, about a 7% cut to current funding levels.",
            "The US Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science would lose nearly 17% from 2020 levels. It would also eliminate the popular Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy, which received a record $425 million last year, and slash the budget of the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy by 74%.",
            "The proposal also seeks a $500-million cut for the National Science Foundation. The agency\u2019s computer science and engineering section is the only one of its directorates that would see an increase, consistent with the administration\u2019s plans to prioritize artificial intelligence and quantum computing.",
            "The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s budget would be slashed by roughly 26%, to $6.7 billion.",
            "Although Congress has repeatedly rebuffed the president\u2019s requests for cuts to science \u2014 and has increased research spending \u2014 the budget proposal offers a view into the administration\u2019s priorities.",
            "\u201cTrump is being Trump,\u201d says Michael Lubell, a physicist at the City College of New York who tracks US science policy. \u201cHe can ask for what he wants, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
            "Researchers have boosted the accuracy of a technique based on the popular CRISPR\u2013Cas9 genome-editing system by engineering enzymes that can precisely target DNA without introducing as many unwanted mutations.",
            "The enzymes, reported on 10 February, could make a method called base editing more feasible as a tool to treat genetic diseases ( J. L. Doman et al Nature Biotechnol. http:// doi.org/dmgf; 2020).",
            "Base editing uses the Cas9 enzyme to target DNA edits to a specific site, where other enzymes chemically convert one DNA base into another. This offers greater control than conventional CRISPR\u2013Cas9 editing, but can still introduce \u2018off-target\u2019 changes at random locations in the genome.",
            "A team led by David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, developed screening methods that can detect unwanted mutations without the need for costly full-genome sequencing. This allowed the team to identify new base-editing enzymes that can change the DNA base C to T without making as many off\u2010target edits. The approach could allow researchers to develop safer gene therapies.",
