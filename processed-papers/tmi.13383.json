On 30. January 2020, the WHO Emergency Committee declared a global health emergency based on growing case notification rates at Chinese and international locations.

            "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive single-stranded large RNA viruses that infect humans, but also a wide range of animals. Coronaviruses were first described in 1966 by Tyrell and Bynoe, who cultivated the viruses from patients with common colds [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Based on their morphology as spherical virions with a core shell and surface projections resembling a solar corona, they were termed coronaviruses (Latin: corona = crown). Four subfamilies, namely alpha-, beta-, gamma- and deltacoronaviruses exist. While alpha- and beta-coronaviruses apparently originate from mammals, in particular from bats, gamma- and delta-viruses originate from pigs and birds. The genome size varies between 26 kb and 32 kb. Among the seven subtypes of coronaviruses that can infect humans, the beta-coronaviruses may cause severe disease and fatalities, whereas alpha-coronaviruses cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. SARSCoV-2 belongs to the B lineage of the beta-coronaviruses and is closely related to the SARS-CoV virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. The major four structural genes encode the nucleocapsid protein (N), the spike protein (S), a small membrane protein (SM) and the membrane glycoprotein (M) with an additional membrane glycoprotein (HE) occurring in the HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 beta-coronaviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]."
