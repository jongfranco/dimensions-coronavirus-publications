Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The \u201creversed halo\u201d sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome.",

            "In conclusion, our study showed that CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and thus may be useful as a standard method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on CT features and rules of transformation. Rapid diagnosis can lead to early control of potential transmission. With CT diagnosis of viral pneumonia, patients with suspected disease can be isolated and treated in time so that the management of patients will be optimized, especially for the hospitals or communities lacking nucleic acid testing kits. However, for the identification of specific viruses, CT is still limited. It is valuable for radiologists to recognize that the CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of diseases caused by viruses from a different family, such as adenovirus, and have differences as well as similarities with viruses within the same family, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV."

            "We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.<br/><br/>In December 2019, a large outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In humans, coronaviruses are among the spectrum of viruses that cause the common cold as well as more severe respiratory diseases\u2014specifically, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which have mortality rates of 10% and 37%, respectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]; both SARS and MERS are zoonotic infections.<br/><br/>The novel coronavirus that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses caused a pneumonia outbreak in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The disease caused by the virus, named coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), can be spread through human-to-human contact. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared a global public health emergency against the outbreak of COVID-19. As of February 19, 2020, several cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed in 24 other countries including Thailand, Australia, and the United States. This episode shows the need for rapid and accurate detection and identification methods that can be used in local hospitals and clinics responsible for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and management for patients."

            "<strong>CT Findings of Adenovirus Infection</strong><br/><br/>CT of one of the two patients with confirmed adenovirus infection showed ill-defined patchy GGOs, segmental and subpleural consolidations in both lungs, and pleural effusion. CT of the other patient showed subpleural GGOs and consolidation with vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign. The CT findings seen in these two adenovirus cases (Fig. 7) are similar to the CT findings seen in the COVID-19 cases.<br/><br/>In our study, viral pneumonia was diagnosed on the basis of CT findings in 49 of 51 (96.1%) patients with COVID-19; the remaining two patients with COVID-19 were bedridden inpatients with underlying diseases. The clinician prescribed isolation and supportive treatment in time for recovery in these 49 patients. Of the 53 patients in our study group, positive CT findings diagnostic of viral pneumonia were available before a positive laboratory test result in 37 (69.8%) patients. The diagnosis of viral pneumonia based on CT was available 3.0 days earlier than that based on nucleic acid test results. Although when in terms of disease progression a clinician chooses to order nucleic acid testing may affect the accuracy of the test results, we are confident that CT has a high accuracy and may be useful as a standard method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The use of CT for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia allows patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection to be isolated and treated in time for recovery, thus optimizing patient management."

We calculated the rate of misdiagnosis and estimated the performance of radiologists based on chest CT to help in the management of patients. We sought to identify the CT features of lesions suggestive of COVID-19 based on the initial CT images and identify the radiographic findings suggestive of COVID-19 transformation on follow-up CT images. We tried to determine whether there are CT features that can be used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection from infections caused by other viruses.",

Viral pneumonia was diagnosed in 51 of the 53 (96.2%) patients; these 51 patients include 49 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and two patients with confirmed adenovirus infection. The misdiagnosis rate of viral infection was 3.8% (2/53). CT findings were positive for viral infection before laboratory results were positive for viral infection in 37 of 53 (69.8%) patients (Fig. 1). The mean lead time in diagnosis of viral infection yielded by CT compared with laboratory results was 3.0 days.",

Ten (19.6%) patients had bronchus deformation due to fibrosis and striplike lesions (Fig. 5). One (2.0%) patient showed pleural effusion. No patients had mediastinal lymphadenopathy.",

As the disease advances, the upper lobes are affected, even all five lobes of both lungs in some patients.

            "Misdiagnosis of coronavirus disease\u2014 COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection in two patients on the basis of CT findings. The patients were inpatients in the rehabilitation department. CT of one patient showed opacities and consolidations along the bronchovascular bundles and unilateral pleural effusion. CT of the other patient showed dense consolidation in the subpleural area without GGO."
        ],
        "CT Findings of Adenovirus Infection": [
            "CT of one of the two patients with confirmed adenovirus infection showed ill-defined patchy GGOs, segmental and subpleural consolidations in both lungs, and pleural effusion. CT of the other patient showed subpleural GGOs and consolidation with vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign. The CT findings seen in these two adenovirus cases (Fig. 7) are similar to the CT findings seen in the COVID-19 cases.",
            "In our study, viral pneumonia was diagnosed on the basis of CT findings in 49 of 51 (96.1%) patients with COVID-19; the remaining two patients with COVID-19 were bedridden inpatients with underlying diseases. The clinician prescribed isolation and supportive treatment in time for recovery in these 49 patients. Of the 53 patients in our study group, positive CT findings diagnostic of viral pneumonia were available before a positive laboratory test result in 37 (69.8%) patients. The diagnosis of viral pneumonia based on CT was available 3.0 days earlier than that based on nucleic acid test results. Although when in terms of disease progression a clinician chooses to order nucleic acid testing may affect the accuracy of the test results, we are confident that CT has a high accuracy and may be useful as a standard method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The use of CT for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia allows patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection to be isolated and treated in time for recovery, thus optimizing patient management.",
            "The CT patterns of viral pneumonia are related to the pathogenesis of the viral infection. Viruses of the same family (e.g., Coronaviridae) have a similar pathogenesis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Therefore, viral pneumonia caused by different viruses from the same virus family exhibit a similar pattern on chest CT images. SARSCoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus according to genome analysis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. SARSCoV and MERS-CoV were identified as members of the family Coronaviridae in 2003 and 2012, respectively. Some CT features of patients with confirmed COVID-19 that were frequently seen in patients in our investigation are similar to the CT features of SARS and MERS. Of the 51 patients in our COVID-19 cohort, only two (3.9%) did not have GGO or consolidation. Therefore, our results show that GGO and consolidation were two main signs on CT images of COVID-19 lesions.",
            "Angiotensin-converting enzyme II is a key molecule involved in the development and progression of acute lung failure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. SARSCoV induces direct lung injury by involving angiotensin-converting enzyme, which contributes to diffuse alveolar damage [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. This may explain the pathologic mechanism of GGO and consolidation as well as the rapid changes in CT findings. Our results support the observed trend that bilateral GGOs or consolidations on chest imaging should prompt the radiologist to suggest COVID-19 as a possible diagnosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. However, we observed that some patients had difficulty breathing during CT, so obtaining perfect CT images during end-inspiration may be difficult in this population. Therefore, when reviewing CT examinations, radiologists should pay attention to differentiating GGO or consolidation from motion artifact. Furthermore, we found that all the CT features seen on the initial chest CT examinations of patients with COVID-19\u2014GGO, consolidation, vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, air bronchogram sign, and air trapping\u2014are similar to the CT features of SARS and MERS. These CT features are caused by alveolar and interstitial pulmonary injury and edema.",
            "We also observed some CT features of COVID-19 that differ from the CT features of SARS and MERS. In our study group of patients with COVID-19, CT showed a reversed halo sign in two (3.9%) patients and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign in nine (17.6%) patients. These findings are not mentioned, to our knowledge, in the studies in the literature about SARS and MERS. In addition, unifocal involvement is more common than multifocal involvement on chest CT of patients with SARS and patients with MERS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. However, the opposite is seen on chest CT of patients with COVID-19: Multifocal involvement was more common than unifocal involvement in our study. This finding is supported by the study of Chung et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "As the severe infectious diseases of SARS or MERS progress, lung parenchymal abnormalities eventually spread to the central area and bilateral upper lobes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In our study, COVID-19 progression on CT images supported this CT pattern of progression. In our cohort of patients with COVID-19, the distribution of disease was predominantly peripheral (subpleural) and confined to the middle and lower zones of the lung on the initial chest CT. Follow-up CT showed that, as the disease advanced, consolidation and coalescing infiltrates pervaded the lungs and the upper lobes were affected; in fact, in some patients, all five lobes of both lungs were affected, with CT showing white lungs. In our study group, the increasing numbers of GGOs and densities of consolidation indicated disease progression, whereas the appearance of fibrosis and resolution of GGO or consolidation indicated improvement. Deformation of the bronchus due to fibrosis and striplike lesions may cause irreversible injury and may affect the respiratory function of the patient. We noted that the initial CT images showed fibrosis and striplike lesions with deformation of the bronchus in 10 (19.6%) patients: These cases indicate that COVID-19 lesions may be present before symptoms develop and became obvious to patients and that CT should have been performed earlier in these cases.",
            "Of the patients who underwent follow-up CT, CT showed progression in 75.0% (18/24). One patient who underwent five follow-up CT examinations was in an unstable condition and showed mild progression on the fifth follow-up study after initial marked progression on the first and second follow-up studies and improvement on the third and fourth follow-up studies. Although WHO's preliminary estimate shows COVID-19 has a relatively lower mortality rate compared with the mortality rates of SARS and MERS, our study showed that most patients with COVID-19 may experience progression. However, we did not compare the CT findings with the symptoms of the patients. Further study might be needed.",
            "We found that two patients with COVID-19 did not present with CT patterns typical of viral pneumonia. Because these two patients did not have CT features and distribution typical of COVID-19, radiologists could not differentiate COVID-19 from a common bacterial infection or coinfection with bacterial infection. These misdiagnosed cases indicate that we should consider COVID-19 in the differential diagnosis when in-patients show fever of unknown origin.",
            "Adenoviruses belong to the Adenoviridae family, a family of double-stranded DNA viruses. Some studies in the literature have reported that adenovirus pneumonia shows bilateral multifocal GGOs with lobar or segmental distribution indicative of broncho-pneumonia, which resembles bacterial pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. One of the two patients in our study with confirmed adenovirus infection had these CT findings. The other patient had CT findings showing GGO and consolidation similar to the CT findings of COVID-19.",
            "In this retrospective cohort of COVID-19 cases and adenovirus cases confirmed between January 23, 2020, and January 29, 2020, no children were included. The lack of children with COVID-19 in our study group is consistent with a description in a study in the literature; the authors of that study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] suggested that children might be less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 than adults or, if infected, may show milder symptoms than adults. This potential characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 seen in our study group is similar to MERS-CoV: One characteristic feature of MERS-CoV is the extremely low number of children who were affected by the disease, and the course of pediatric MERS cases is usually mild or asymptomatic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. However, we continue to collect information on children's infections that can be new sources of infection. Whether the chest CT features of children with COVID-19 are similar to those of adults with COVID-19 needs further study.",
            "In conclusion, our study showed that CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and thus may be useful as a standard method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on CT features and rules of transformation. Rapid diagnosis can lead to early control of potential transmission. With CT diagnosis of viral pneumonia, patients with suspected disease can be isolated and treated in time so that the management of patients will be optimized, especially for the hospitals or communities lacking nucleic acid testing kits. However, for the identification of specific viruses, CT is still limited. It is valuable for radiologists to recognize that the CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of diseases caused by viruses from a different family, such as adenovirus, and have differences as well as similarities with viruses within the same family, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV."
