Although the health-care providers have attended multiple training sessions and emergency drills, in operation (especially in high-stress negative pressure wards) some steps might be omitted or overlooked, thus incurring potential exposure to nosocomial infection. For example, when a nurse helped an elderly patient pull up a zipper in the negative pressure ward, the zipper unexpectedly ripped the nurse\u2019s glove.
