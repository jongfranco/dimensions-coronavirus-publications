            "The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Chinese health authorities later identified and announced that a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was accountable for the outbreak of this pneumonia in Wuhan [5]. Thereafter, this disease was named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO), and the causative virus was designated as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [6]. Within one and a half months, as of midnight of",
            "February 2020, the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) had spread from Hubei to 34 provinces in China and another 25 countries, resulting in 75,199 confirmed cases with 2009 deaths (Table 1) [7]. At present, the number of cases is increasing rapidly in China and even around the world, which is a big threat to public health. Thirty-one provinces of China have initiated a level-1 public health response. The aim of this article is to provide a timely review of the characteristics"

        "abstract": "In December 2019, cases of unidentified pneumonia with a history of exposure in the Huanan Seafood Market were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease. Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.",

            "The recent outbreak of the unknown severe pneumonia in China is caused by a novel coronavirus named 2019-nCoV [2], later was designated SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. This virus and the SARSr-CoV/MERSr-CoV share a common ancestor [2]. Compared with SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 results in much lower mortality in patients but has a comparable infection ability. From the analysis of the fatal cases of this novel coronavirus pneumonia, the comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis were found to be dangerous factors that resulted in death.<br/><br/>In 2002 and 2003, the outbreak of SARS brought a disaster to the people of the world, especially the Chinese people [24,25]. Fortunately, SARS was finally defeated, and Chinese health departments upgraded their disease prevention and control system by summing up their experiences of fighting SARS. Thus, when COVID-19 appeared, the whole country quickly entered a state of fighting against the new infectious disease. Policies led by the National Health Commission have been formulated and implemented efficiently, and Chinese scientists identified the etiology of the disease in no more than a month. However, new cases are increasing every day, showing a trend of spreading to the whole country and across the world."

Pathogenic Characteristics of Coronavirus",
            "Coronavirus is a single strand positive RNA (+ssRNA) virus, belonging to order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae [13]. According to the characteristics of serotype and genome, the coronavirus subfamily is divided into four genera: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 [14]. There are six kinds of coronaviruses known to infect humans, including 229E and NL63 of \u03b1 genus [15,16], OC43, HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERSr-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) of \u03b2 genus [16,17]. The coronavirus isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients with unidentified pneumonia in Wuhan is a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to genus \u03b2, and subgenus sarbe [5]. SARS-CoV-2 is different from the zoonotic MERSr-CoV and SARSr-CoV and becomes the seventh coronavirus to infect humans [5]. The phylogenetic analysis of the coronaviruses based on full-length genome sequences shows that SARS-CoV-2 has the smallest genetic distance from bat coronavirus, but only about 45%\u201390% similarity with SARSr-CoV, and a lower similarity of 20%\u201360% with MERSr-CoV [18]. Therefore, a bat is probably the original host of SARS-CoV-2, although the intermediate host may still exist in the process of transmission from bats to human beings.",
            "Coronavirus has an envelope, the particles are round or oval, often pleomorphic, with a diameter of 50\u2013200 nm [18]. S protein is located on the surface of the virus and forms a rod-shaped structure. As one of the main antigenic proteins of the virus, the S protein gene is the main target used for typing [19]. Xu et al also reported that SARS-CoV-2 S-protein supports a strong interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) molecules, which means that the virus poses a significant public health risk for human transmission by the S-protein\u2013ACE2 binding pathway [18].",

Fever, fatigue, and a dry cough are the main manifestations. Nasal obstruction, runny nose, and other upper respiratory symptoms are rare. About half of the patients developed dyspnea one week later, and severe cases developed rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, hard-to-correct metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction. Severe and critical patients may present moderate to low fever, or even no obvious fever. Some patients have mild onset symptoms, no fever, and mostly recovered after one week. Most patients have a favorable prognosis, although some patients are left in a critical condition, or do not survive. The aged patients and the patients with basic diseases have worse prognosis. Children cases are relatively mild."

Most patients show elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and normal procalcitonin. In severe cases, the patients present with increased D-dimer and progressively decreased peripheral blood lymphocyte [20]. Compared with non-ICU patients, the plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1a, and TNF-\u03b1 were higher in ICU patients [21]."

In the early stages of the disease, patients present with multiple small patch shadows and interstitial changes, especially in the extrapulmonary zone. It further progresses to multiple ground glass shadows and infiltrative shadows in both lungs. In severe cases, lung consolidation may occur, but pleural effusion is rare [20].",
            "To provide more information about the disease for the treatment in clinics, we collected detailed information about the fatal cases released by official channels.

A total of 26 cases with fatalities were used to disclose the dangerous comorbidities, showing that the major comorbidities are hypertension (53.8%), diabetes (42.3%), coronary heart disease (19.2%), cerebral infarction (15.4%), chronic bronchitis (19.2%) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (7.7%) (Figure 2). Chen N et al reported that, among 99 confirmed cases, the common symptoms are fever (83%), cough (82%), bilateral pneumonia (75%), short of breath (31%), muscle ache (11%), confusion (9%), headache (8%), sore throat (5%), rhinorrhoea (4%), chest pain (2%), diarrhoea (2%), and nausea and vomiting (1%) [4].

            "The recent outbreak of the unknown severe pneumonia in China is caused by a novel coronavirus named 2019-nCoV [2], later was designated SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. This virus and the SARSr-CoV/MERSr-CoV share a common ancestor [2]. Compared with SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 results in much lower mortality in patients but has a comparable infection ability. From the analysis of the fatal cases of this novel coronavirus pneumonia, the comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis were found to be dangerous factors that resulted in death.",
            "In 2002 and 2003, the outbreak of SARS brought a disaster to the people of the world, especially the Chinese people [24,25]. Fortunately, SARS was finally defeated, and Chinese health departments upgraded their disease prevention and control system by summing up their experiences of fighting SARS. Thus, when COVID-19 appeared, the whole country quickly entered a state of fighting against the new infectious disease. Policies led by the National Health Commission have been formulated and implemented efficiently, and Chinese scientists identified the etiology of the disease in no more than a month. However, new cases are increasing every day, showing a trend of spreading to the whole country and across the world.",
            "COVID-19 appeared just one month before the Spring Festival of China, and the massive population flow has brought great challenges for disease prevention and control. This virus can be transmitted from human to human and no effective treatment drug has been found. The most effective prevention and control measures are to find suspected patients and close contacts, confirm patients and virus carriers, and block the transmission through isolation, disinfection, and personal protection. Therefore, early detection, isolation, and treatment of patients are the key measures to control the source of infection and reduce the infection rate. It is also crucial to avoid nosocomial infection by strengthening the management of medical staff and patients. Health education on knowledge for disease prevention and control is also important. Finally, if we want to eliminate the threat of this novel coronavirus pneumonia similar to SARS, we need to learn more about the pathogenesis of the virus and develop specific vaccines and therapeutic drugs as soon as possible."
