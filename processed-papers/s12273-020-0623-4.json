        "abstract": "Aerial dispersion of human exhaled microbial contaminants and subsequent contamination of surfaces is a potential route for infection transmission in hospitals. Most general hospital wards have ventilation systems that drive air and thus contaminants from the patient areas towards the corridors. This study investigates the transport mechanism and deposition patterns of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) within a typical six bedded general inpatient ward cubicle through numerical simulation. It demonstrates that both air change and exhaust airflow rates have significant effects on not only the airflow but also the particle distribution within a mechanically ventilated space. Moreover, the location of an infected patient within the ward cubicle is crucial in determining the extent of infection risk to other ward occupants. Hence, it is recommended to provide exhaust grilles in close proximity to a patient, preferably above each patient\u2019s bed. To achieve infection prevention and control, high exhaust airflow rate is also suggested. Regardless of the ventilation design, all patients and any surfaces within a ward cubicle should be regularly and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to remove microbial contamination. The outcome of this study can serve as a source of reference for hospital management to better ventilation design strategies for mitigating the risk of infection.",

Recirculation zones, which may occur when the cold supply air from the diffusers interacts with the upward airflow caused by the thermal plumes, are observed. These zones can enhance the mixing of air within the ward space. Moreover, the suction provided by the local exhaust grilles tends to alter the airflow pattern around a patient and thus can help to remove airborne contaminants in the immediate vicinity of the patient"

            "The airflow distribution and the transport mechanisms of bioaerosols in the ward cubicle were investigated using a finite volume based CFD code (Ansys Fluent 13.0). The numerical simulation model consists of a continuum phase (air) and a discrete phase (droplet nuclei). In this study, the governing equations of continuity, momentum and energy for the continuum phase were based on an Eulerian framework, and the discrete phase was modelled by a Lagrangian framework (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWong_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rWong_et+al_2010_a\">Wong et al 2010</a>). The threedimensional airflow was modelled as a steady-state incompressible turbulent flow. CFD possess miscellaneous number of turbulence models, although it is very difficult to pinpoint one turbulence model that outperforms others for all class of problems. Hence, the turbulence model selection is a compromise based on factors such as flow physics involved, established practice for predicting a particular set of problem, computational resources, accuracy level and simulation time (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGao_2005_a\" href=\"#rGao_2005_a\">Gao and Niu 2005</a>). Numerous studies on turbulent indoor airflow have been carried out through Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations, whereas for some case studies large eddy scale simulations (LES) have been preferred to provide accurate prediction of flow field variables. However, LES demands much higher grid requirements as well as computational time compared to RANS, which makes RANS widely used (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBlocken_2018_a\" href=\"#rBlocken_2018_a\">Blocken 2018</a>). The Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equation greatly reduces the complexity involved in the simulation of turbulent flows. The equations have time averaged flow field variables which would eliminate the turbulent fluctuations. Although, this simplification leads to the creation of additional Reynolds stress tensors which are unknowns within the equation and leads to closure issues. The Eddy viscosity turbulence modelling provides closure to equations and the most preferred eddy viscosity turbulence model to simulate the indoor airflow distribution is the renormalization group (RNG) k-\u03b5. The RNG k-\u03b5 model, was chosen to model the air turbulence in this study, as it offers better accuracy, stability and computing efficiency for low reynolds number as well as near wall flows (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_1995_a\" href=\"#rChen_1995_a\">Chen 1995</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhang_2006_a\" href=\"#rZhang_2006_a\">Zhang and Chen 2006</a>; Zhang et al 2007). The diffuser inlets were defined as velocity-inlet, while corridor and exhaust grilles were treated as outflow boundary condition. Ansys Fluent treats outflow boundaries as having zero diffusion flux for all flow variables as well as it incorporates an overall mass balance correction. Furthermore, outflow with flow rate weighting option enables the user to have multiple outflow boundaries with fractional flow rate through each boundary (ANSYS 2010). A second-order upwind scheme was applied to discretize the governing equations while the SIMPLE algorithm was used for the pressurevelocity coupling in the continuum phase. The metabolic rate of a reclining patient was assumed to be 0.8 MET",

The individual mesh files are then merged together using the tmerge filter functionality. In tmerge, before the individual meshes are combined together to one mesh file, the required scaling factor, translation distance and rotation information of the meshes is specified. With the existence of non-identical mesh node locations as shown in Fig. 2 along the boundaries of the individual cell zones of the computational domain, non-conformal interfaces are established between individual cell zones. These interfaces connect each cell zones by transferring fluxes from one mesh to another (ANSYS 2010). The first cell height from wall is kept at a distance of 0.001 m and grid spacing of 1.2 is maintained throughout the domain.

            "In the base case, almost half of the virus particles exhaled from a patient\u2019s mouth deposited onto the patient\u2019s body and bed. According to Fig. 6, there were considerable amounts of virus particles on different cubicle surfaces including walls, floor and ceiling. A maximum rc (\u2248 0.26), resulted from the supine patients and their exhaled air velocities, Fig. 5 Simulation results of ward cubicle with exhaust grilles at 9ACH and exhaust air (EA)=50%: (a) temperature distribution; (b) velocity vector plot",
            "As shown in Fig. 7(a), patients in beds located at 1.625 m away from the corridor (i.e. Patients 1 and 2) were most vulnerable to cross infection (with exposure risk (E) > 0.05) while those at 5.875 m away (i.e. Patients 5 and 6) were least (with E < 0.025). With an increase in air change rate, a significant reduction in infection risk was observed for patients located farther away from the corridor. This can be explained by the general airflow patterns as illustrated in Fig. 3. On average, the infection risk level of Patients 5 and 6 was only half of that of Patients 1 and 2 for all air change rates.",
            "Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that the local exhaust grilles not only facilitated the removal of a portion of exhaled virus particles but also tended to increase the particle deposition",
            "in the source patient\u2019s body and thereby reduced the residual viral load present in the air. As exhibited in Fig. 6(a), the recorded values of rc at 3 h\u22121 were approximately 0.12 and 0.10 for EA = 10% and EA = 50% (i.e. decreases of 53% and 61%; comparing with the base case) respectively. For all other cases shown in the figure, similarly, rc decreased as the air change rate increased. According to Figs. 6(b) and (c), wall and floor deposition ratios were also significantly reduced with EA = 10% and 50% (rw < 0.05 and rf < 0.03).",
            "However, deposition of particles was observed in all scenarios. As the deposition is random in nature and often happens irrespective of the ventilation system design, it highlights the importance of regular and proper ward housekeeping. Furthermore, the randomness associated with particle deposition rates (rw, rc, and rf) under different air change rate conditions can be attributed to the asymmetric airflow distribution patterns and locations of the infected patients.",
            "Figures 7(b) and (c) indicate that the installation of exhaust grilles in close proximity to each patient can help prevent particle migration from an infected patient to different locations in the ward and significantly reduce individual patient exposures (E < 0.05). The results show that the location of an infected patient, exhaust airflow rates and air change rates within the cubicle work together influencing the mechanism of viral spread."
        ],
        "3.2 Infection from a ward cubicle to the corridor": [
            "The pathogen spatial distribution is dependent on the ward layout, ventilation strategy and location of the source patient. It can be observed in Fig. 8(a) that exhausted ratio re increases with air change rate in the base case. The maximum re was recorded for Patients 1 and 2. From re < 0.05 at 3 h\u22121 to re > 0.25 at 13 h\u22121, an abrupt increase in risk (80%) was noted for these patients. At higher air change rates, specifically at 13 h\u22121, the number of particles reaching the corridor due to the exhalation activities of Patients 5 and 6 located at the rear end of the ward (i.e. 5.875 m away from corridor) was quite high (0.05 < re < 0.1). This suggests that the use of a high air change rate such as 13 h\u22121 can put the users of the corridor and its connected amenities at high risk of exposure to pathogens and facilitate infectious disease outbreaks in the whole healthcare facility.",
            "As shown in Figs. 8(b) and (c), the installation of exhaust grilles considerably reduced the risk of infection transmission. The exhaust grilles lowered the re values of Patients 1 and 2 at 13 h\u22121 to 0.15 with EA = 10% (i.e. a decrease of 40%; comparing with the base case) and < 0.03 with EA = 50% (i.e. a decrease of 88%; comparing with the base case). Specifically, the supine patients at the rear end of the ward cubicle (i.e. Patients 5 and 6) contributed the least to the spread of infection to the corridor (re < 0.006). As the local exhaust airflow rate proved effective in reducing the risk of infection transmission, both the location and airflow rate of an exhaust grille are crucial factors for designing infection control strategies."
        ],
        "4 Conclusion": [
            "This study investigated the transport mechanism and deposition patterns of MERS-CoV within an air-conditioned general inpatient ward cubicle. It demonstrated that both air change and exhaust airflow rates have significant effects on not only the airflow but also the particle distribution within a mechanically ventilated space. Moreover, the location of an infected patient within the ward cubicle is crucial in determining the extent of infection risk to other ward occupants. Hence, it is recommended to provide exhaust grilles in close proximity to a patient, preferably above each patient\u2019s bed. To achieve infection prevention and control, high exhaust airflow rate is also suggested. Regardless of the ventilation design, all patients and any surfaces within a ward cubicle should be regularly and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to remove microbial contamination. Installation of UVGI lamps in the ward space is recommended to further enhance the risk mitigation strategies. The outcome of this study can serve as a source of reference for hospital management to better ventilation design strategies for mitigating the risk of infection."
