        "Introduction": [
            "An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China and caused atypical pneumonia called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] The disease is characterized by fever, cough, fatigue, and ground\u2010glass opacity on chest tomography.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] The epidemic began with four confirmed cases on 29 December 2019.2 The first confirmed case in Tibet was announced 1 month later on 29 January 2020.",
            "The emergence of an infectious disease consists of three vital elements: infectious source, susceptible population, and transmission route."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Most patients with COVID\u201019 among the first cluster of pneumonia cases (27 of 41, 65.9%) were exposed to Huanan seafood market,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and several wild animals, including bats, snakes, minks, and pangolins, were reported to be the possible reservoir for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.4\u20106 Patients are currently the major sources for the COVID\u201019 outbreak given the increasing number of cases.",
            "A susceptible population is the second important factor for COVID\u201019 control.",
            "SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is transmitted between humans mainly via aerial droplets and direct contact.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] The virus is found in stool specimens of patients, suggesting potential fecal\u2010oral transmission pathway; this route requires further investigation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] The Wuhan government has pronounced to shut down public transport system since 23 January 2020 to control virus",
            "425 cases were reported before 22 January 2020, yet, the confirmed cases have explosively increased since .[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] One possible reason may be that millions of people had left Wuhan for the traditional Spring Festival before the city closed.",
            "Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces have all announced a huge number of confirmed cases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Local transmission chains in these provinces may have started through the index cases imported from Hubei Province."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "The Chinese government rapidly initiated serial measures, such as isolating Wuhan and the whole Hubei Province, improving epidemic information monitoring and reporting, and detecting, isolating, and curing patients.",
            "More than 8000 physicians and nurses from other provinces went to Hubei Province and started to combat the disease with local medical staff.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] At the same time, two hospitals with 2600 beds in total have been built in Wuhan for confirmed and suspected patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] A fast and effective detection system was established and maintained to differentiate suspected patients continuously."
