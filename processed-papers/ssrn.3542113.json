This note points to China\u2019s much larger relevance in the global value chain, especially as concerns exports of intermediate goods. When SARS hit in 2003, China manufacturing export share was only 8% and by 2018 it was 19%. By moving up the ladder, China\u2019s has become a much more important player in exporting intermediate goods than before, which means that any disruption in China\u2019s production capacity could affect the rest of the world more severely than in the past.",
