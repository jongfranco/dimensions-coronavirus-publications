Scientists don\u2019t know how long the incubation period lasts or whether infected people who show no symptoms can transmit the virus. China\u2019s state-run news agency Xinhua reported on 26 January that a seemingly healthy man appeared to have infected \u201ca few colleagues.\u201d If asymptomatic people frequently infect others, it could vastly complicate efforts to contain 2019-nCoV.",

            "WHERE DID THE VIRUS COME FROM? Almost certainly from animals, but when and how are mysteries. Genetic analyses are starting to yield some clues.
