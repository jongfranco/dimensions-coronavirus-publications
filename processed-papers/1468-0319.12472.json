Assuming immediate disruption to tourism activity, supply chain constraints for the frail manufacturing sector and heightened uncertainty restraining business and consumer outlays, we currently estimate that GDP growth may be dampened by 0.15ppt in 2020 as a result of the virus. With real GDP growth slowing from 2.3% in 2019 to 1.6% in 2020, we anticipate at least one Fed rate cut this year, in June.",

For 2020, our simulation suggests that global GDP could be reduced by 0.25ppt, more than the 0.15ppt impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak. However, given the increased interconnectedness of the global economy, we cannot discount the possibility of the virus spreading more rapidly, or of larger effects from travel restrictions and firm closures.",

While policymakers believe they won\u2019t need to cut rates further in 2020, we believe slowerthan-anticipated growth and inflation will lead to a mid-year rate cut.

Consumer spending grew 1.8% in Q4, as households exercised more caution in the face of elevated policy uncertainty and moderating income growth. Meanwhile business investment saw a third consecutive contraction, declining 1.5% as slower global growth, lingering trade restrictions, reduced energy activity and policy uncertainty continued to take their toll.",

Yet almost 70% of the Q4 growth derived from net trade, which contributed a whopping 1.5ppt to growth after dragging by 0.1ppt in Q3. However, the boost mainly came from an 8.7% plunge in imports \u2013 the weakest figure since 2009, reflecting higher tariffs and more cautious domestic demand.",

Yet still-solid private sector confidence, a robust labor market, and one more Fed rate cut should avert a hard landing.

While officials still see the economy and monetary policy in a \u201cgood place\u201d, Chair Powell corroborated our view that uncertainties surrounding the outlook remain and that the outbreak of the coronavirus comes at a fragile time for the global economy. He also emphasized that the Fed is not comfortable with inflation \u2018near\u2019, but consistently below, the target, imparting a dovish bias.

We think TFP growth will be slower, in part because gains from further integration into the global economy will be more modest than in the past, especially given the backdrop of US-China tech tensions which could risk a global technology split and relocation of supply chains.

            "...and has led to a 0.4pp downgrade to our 2020 EM GDP growth forecast to just 4.0%",
            "Intensifying concerns over the coronavirus outbreak have overshadowed tentative signs of growth stabilisation in Emerging Markets (EM). Against this backdrop, we have cut our 2020 aggregate GDP growth forecast by 0.4pp, implying a second consecutive year of 4.0% expansion. This should be followed by a rebound to 4.7% growth in 2021.",
            "Aside from China, where we have cut our 2020 growth forecast to 5.4% (from 6%), the ASEAN region \u2013 Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, in particular \u2013 will likely be most affected by supply-side disruptions emanating from China and a plunge in the number of Chinese tourists. Other regions appear less vulnerable to the spill-over effects, due to less integrated supply chains and lower dependence on Chinese tourism. Nonetheless, we expect some adverse impact on Mexico and Russia, with indirect effects via commodity prices posing downside risks for commodity exporters.",
            "Some of the damage will be offset by fiscal and monetary stimulus. Given low inflation, we see several EM central banks cutting interest rates further (e.g. Egypt, Mexico, Russia, Thailand). These steps should be reinforced by fiscal measures being rolled out in China, Chile and Thailand, among others.",
            "Commodity-sensitive EM currencies have been hit hard by the news of the fastspreading virus and will remain under pressure in the short term given the large hit to demand. But the weakness should prove temporary, assuming activity bounces back in Q2.",

            "The FY21 budget was big on messages and did a good job of laying out the government\u2019s vision of the Indian economy. But it delivered little in terms of an action plan to support sagging domestic demand, which together with coronavirus has led us to cut our 2020 growth forecast 5.5% from 6.0% in January.",
            "The government acknowledged a 0.5% of GDP fiscal slippage in FY20 (ending March 2020) with a revised deficit estimate of 3.8% of GDP. The widely expected income tax cuts came through (estimated revenue loss equal to 0.2% of GDP) and the dividend distribution tax was also removed to provide further relief to corporates (0.1% of GDP)."
        ],
        "RE BE": [
            "The risk remains, however, that spending could be dampened towards the end of the fiscal year to manage fiscal overruns. The narrowing of the deficit to 3.5% of GDP in FY21 relies heavily on an ambitious government asset sales program. We think that the tax collection projections are probably also on the optimistic side. In our baseline, we forecast only a mild consolidation in the deficit to 3.7%.",
            "Our growth outlook for the ASEAN region has been lowered following the 2019-nCoV outbreak. The immediate economic impact will mainly feed through via reduced trade and private consumption. Thailand is expected to be the worst hit among ASEAN economies; with tourism playing a larger role in GDP growth compared to regional peers and a relatively high proportion of tourist arrivals originating from China, we have slashed the 2020 growth forecast to 2.0% from 2.7%. Vietnam and Singapore will also suffer amid supply-side disruptions emanating from China and travel bans. In contrast, we expect the hit to GDP in Indonesia to be contained, at just 0.1%, as its GDP relies less on tourism.",
            "Loosening of monetary policy within the region and proactive boosts to fiscal spending should offer support to domestic demand and partially stymie the impact from the virus outbreak. Policy rates have already been cut in Thailand, Malaysia and Philippines by 25bp each this year, with a further cut now expected in Indonesia in Q1 2020. In addition, Singapore, Indonesia and Philippines are also expected to run larger fiscal deficits in 2020 as governments in these countries introduce measures to blunt the impact of the virus and pursue domestic investment programmes."

            "A mixed performance across the region suggests subdued but better growth this year. But the coronavirus outbreak threatens the growth outlook in Q1 as transitory disruption to global supply chains and tourism bans will hit activity (albeit mildly) in the region\u2019s largest economies. While Brazil\u2019s exposure to Chinese manufacturing and tourism seems very small (as a % of GDP), Mexico and Chile are more exposed. And in Mexico, a contraction in Q4 GDP has lowered the statistical carry-over into 2020, which, in conjunction with depressed business confidence and investment, has prompted us to cut our 2020 GDP growth forecast to 0.5%, from 0.9% previously. This, coupled with modest changes in Brazil, has resulted in a 0.1ppt downward revision to LatAm (ex-Venezuela) GDP growth in 2020 to 1.5%."

            "Expectations of virus-driven disruption to economic activity have led us to nudge down our forecast for 2020 GDP growth to 1.7% (from 1.8% last month).",
            "China is Russia\u2019s largest trading partner, accounting for 13% of Russia\u2019s merchandise exports, nearly three quarters of which are oil. The suspension of travel and tourism (which generated $2bn in 2019), along with a possible 20% slump in China\u2019s oil demand, compounded by the broad-based decline in China\u2019s overall consumption and manufacturing and by secondary effects to global demand, will likely shave off about 2% from Russia\u2019s overall real exports and about 0.4ppt from GDP growth in 2020. We expect the CBR to cut interest rates further in the coming months, bringing the policy rate down to 5.25%.",
            "Power cuts weighed on activity in H2 2019 (we have factored in a technical recession) and will be a regular occurrence this year and most likely into 2021, dampening investment attractiveness and business sentiment (reflected in forwardlooking components of the PMI). Developments on the policy front have also disappointed, and while some clarity on the government\u2019s plans to deal with struggling SOEs and the energy situation should emerge from the next budget (on 26 February), the pace and scale of reform will most likely disappoint. Meanwhile, the South African Reserve Bank unexpectedly reduced the country\u2019s benchmark interest rate by 25bp to 6.25% in January, but this monetary stimulus will only have a marginal impact on activity."
