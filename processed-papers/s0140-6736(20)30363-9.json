            "The political weaponisation of migration is a threat to ideas of universality, equity, and justice, ideas that are central to our concepts of health and health care. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), there are 272 million international migrants today\u2014people living in a country other than their own. The IOM emphasises how small this number is: just 3\u00b75% of the world\u2019s population. But that figure still represents over half the population of the European Union. It is a vast signal of human vulnerability. And please consider the trajectory. The highest number of internally displaced persons from violence and conflict on record today (41\u00b73 million people). The increasing impact of a growing environmental crisis, with an estimated 1 billion climate refugees by 2100. The rising importance of food insecurity among migrants. The gradual feminisation of labour migration. And the threats to global health security from migration in an era of new infectious epidemics, as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak shows only too tragically. Last week, The Lancet announced the launch of Lancet Migration, a new global collaboration to advance migration health. This initiative follows the 2018 publication of our UCL\u2013Lancet Commission on Migration and Health, chaired by Ibrahim Abubakar. Miriam Orcutt is Lancet Migration\u2019s Executive Director and she will lead a programme of work on migration\u2019s intersection with universal health coverage, the climate emergency, and gender. The academic community can\u2019t retreat in the face of extreme political populism, which is fuelling racism, xenophobia, and hate. We have to do something. Lancet Migration is our effort to resist.

            "Here is US President Donald Trump last week in his State of the Union Address: \u201cA good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and highquality healthcare system on Earth...Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidise free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders...If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens. This will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built.\u201d Populism is the political order of the day. Trump is poised to win another presidential term. Boris Johnson may be the UK\u2019s Prime Minister for a decade. And don\u2019t forget Jair Bolsonaro, Narendra Modi, and Rodrigo Duterte.",
