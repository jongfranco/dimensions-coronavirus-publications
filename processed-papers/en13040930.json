        "abstract": "Since the demonstration of the first modern silicon solar cells at Bell Labs in 1954, it took 58 years until the cumulative installed photovoltaic electricity generation capacity had reached 100 GW by the end of 2012. Then, it took another five years to reach an annual installation capacity of over 100 GW in 2017 and close to 120 GW in 2019. As a consequence, the total world-wide installed photovoltaic electricity generation capacity exceeded 635 GW at the end of 2019. Although it witnessed a 20% and 25% decrease in annual installations in 2018 and 2019, respectively, China was again the largest market with 30 GW of annual installations. The number of countries in the club with more than 1 GW annually has increased to 18 countries in 2019. The use of local battery storage systems in solar farms as well as decentralized photovoltaic electricity generation systems combined has again increased, due to the falling storage system costs.",

However, this scenario does not yet take into account a broad electrification of our total energy supply, especially in the transport, heating, and cooling sector as well as electrification of industrial processes.

            "The already low costs of solar electricity generation with PV systems and the potential for further cost reduction will drive the growth of PV installations in the coming decades. A number of PV industry associations, as well as Greenpeace, the European Renewable Energy Council (EREC), the Energy Watch Group with Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT), Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), and the International Energy Agency and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), have developed scenarios for the future growth of PV systems [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. The different deployment figures of these scenarios are shown in Table 1. Between 2016 and 2019, the predicted PV capacity in the IEA World Energy Outlook has significantly increased. The JRC PV Status Reports have tracked pre-2016 scenarios [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>].<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that some of the 2020 values were already exceeded in 2019 (red figures). Despite the existing differences in the deployment pathways and ambitions, all scenarios indicate huge growth potentials for PV power in the future, provided that an enabling policy framework is in place. It is important to remember that system changes\u2014and the massive deployment of solar PV is such change\u2014will not happen by itself, but need the active support of all stakeholders. In order to stay on the 1.5 \u25e6C track, society has to realize the energy transition towards a net zero carbon energy supply by 2050 and PV is a crucial pillar to achieve this. However, there are still a number of barriers ranging from perception, legal, and regulatory conditions as well as technical limitations of the existing transmission and distribution systems. Neither the necessary adaptation and transformation of the energy networks nor the political will to accelerate the use of renewable energy sources and PV is in line with the urgency to decarbonize our energy supply by 2050."

Under this scenario, the power sector has to be 80% carbon free by 2040. In this scenario, solar photovoltaic electricity generation would have to supply 3518 TWh in 2030 and 7208 TWh in 2040. However, this scenario does not yet take into account a broad electrification of our total energy supply, especially in the transport, heating, and cooling sector as well as electrification of industrial processes. It is interesting to note that the WEO2019 sustainable development scenario is converging with the Greenpeace [r]evolution world energy scenario 2015 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].",

            "Over the last few years, the capital expenditures (CAPEX) for PV solar systems have converged globally. However, differences in market size and local competition can still lead to significant differences. Local factors like import taxes, local content rules, or existing tax credits have an additional influence on local prices. A global benchmark for levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is published regularly by BNEF. For the 2nd half year (H2) 2019, this benchmark in the solar sector was USD 51 per MWh, which corresponds to a decrease of about 15% compared to of the second half 2018 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. With this, the LCOE for non-tracking silicon PV systems have decreased by over 77% over the last 10 years [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The contribution of solar module costs towards the benchmark PV system CAPEX has fallen below 30%.",
            "Battery costs have decreased by roughly 85% between 2010 and 2018 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. This price reduction as well as various incentive programs have increased the number of residential and commercial PV projects with storage. The addition of storage in large scale PV plants mainly is driven by the goal to utilize the alternating current (AC) connection as efficient as possible.",
            "A number of factors determine the real electricity generation costs from photovoltaic systems. Geographical and technology factors like the solar radiation, tracking or no-tracking PV system design, string or central inverter configuration, fixed operation and maintenance (O&M) as well as connection costs are important. However, the financial aspects of a project like the share between debt and equity as well the interest rates and return on equity expectations have a more significant influence and can differ substantially from country to country. The variation of LCOE for non-tracking systems varied between USD 39 to 73 per MWh without and USD 65 and 213 per MWh with storage in the second half of 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. One-axis tracking systems without storage varied between USD 35 and 65 per MWh. Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) can have even lower prices, depending on the solar radiation, local tax regime, and financing conditions.",

A number of PV industry associations, as well as Greenpeace, the European Renewable Energy Council (EREC), the Energy Watch Group with Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT), Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), and the International Energy Agency and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), have developed scenarios for the future growth of PV systems [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. The different deployment figures of these scenarios are shown in Table 1. Between 2016 and 2019, the predicted PV capacity in the IEA World Energy Outlook has significantly increased. The JRC PV Status Reports have tracked pre-2016 scenarios [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>].",

Despite the existing differences in the deployment pathways and ambitions, all scenarios indicate huge growth potentials for PV power in the future, provided that an enabling policy framework is in place. It is important to remember that system changes\u2014and the massive deployment of solar PV is such change\u2014will not happen by itself, but need the active support of all stakeholders. In order to stay on the 1.5 \u25e6C track, society has to realize the energy transition towards a net zero carbon energy supply by 2050 and PV is a crucial pillar to achieve this. However, there are still a number of barriers ranging from perception, legal, and regulatory conditions as well as technical limitations of the existing transmission and distribution systems. Neither the necessary adaptation and transformation of the energy networks nor the political will to accelerate the use of renewable energy sources and PV is in line with the urgency to decarbonize our energy supply by 2050.",
