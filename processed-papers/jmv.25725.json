At an interval of 2\u20133 days, tear and conjunctival secretions were collected twice with disposable sampling swabs for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.\nResults: 21 common type and 9 severe type NCP patients were enrolled. Two samples of tear and conjunctival secretions were obtained from the only one patient with conjunctivitis yielded positive RT-PCR results. 58 samples from other patents were all negative.\nConclusion: We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis.",

            "In December 2019, 41 cases of unexplained pneumonia were clustered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

The diagnostic criteria were: 1. real-time RT-PCR assay of respiratory or blood specimens yielded positive results for the novel coronavirus nucleic acid.",
            "2. Computerized tomography (CT) lung imaging findings were consistent with viral pneumonia. The common-type diagnostic criteria was the diagnosed patients exclude the severe-type criteria. The severe-type diagnostic criteria were: 1. respiratory distress (respiratory rate \u226530 cycles/minute), 2. oxygen saturation \u226493% or arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/oxygen concentration FiO2 \u2264300 mmHg in the resting state, 3. respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, 4. shock, and 5. other forms of organ failure requiring monitoring and treatment at the intensive care unit[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].",

            "We used the conjunctival swab technique (Figure 1) to collect tears and conjunctival secretions from patients. We opened the lower eyelid of each patient and used a disposable sampling swab to wipe the conjunctiva of the lower eyelid fornix of the patient\u2019s eyes without anesthesia. Then, we placed one side of the head of the sampling swab into the sample preservation solution of the disposable virus sample tube, broke off the end of the swab along the red scale, and closed the cap of the virus sampling tube. Each specimen was stored in a 4\u00b0C refrigerator, and then sent to the laboratory of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. RT-PCR assays were performed at the State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. To avoid cross-infection, gloves were changed after collecting each sample. At the time of collection of each sample, the patient\u2019s current temperature was recorded and a sputum sample obtained, and the sputum sample was also sent to the laboratory for examination. Two samples were taken from each patient, at intervals of 2\u20133 days. Prior to collecting the first sample, we recorded the time of onset of symptoms and how and when the antiviral drug was used for each patient.",

            "In December 2019, 41 cases of unexplained pneumonia were clustered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Therefore, this is a focus of the current research to understand whether COVID-19 is transmitted via other routes and reduce further spread of the epidemic.",
            "In the present study, the tear and conjunctival secretions of patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus were collected for viral culture and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, attempting to elucidate the presence of novel coronaviruses in tears and conjunctival secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and provide evidence for further understanding the transmission route of this disease."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "or carriers of the virus. According to recent reports, a large number of ophthalmologists involved in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease on a daily basis accidentally acquired novel coronavirus pneumonia. Thus, many doctors suspect that it is related to contact with tears or conjunctival secretions of patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] In the study of this small sample, we used conjunctival test paper to obtain tears and conjunctival secretions of 30 patients for standard RT-PCR assay. Only one patient with conjunctivitis found viral RNA in his tear fluid and conjunctival secretion twice. The conjunctivitis was characterized by viral conjunctivitis with conjunctival congestion and aqueous secretion. The patient had no severe fever or respiratory symptoms when we collected his specimens. And the course of disease was in the early stage for only 3 days.",
            "No viral RNA was detected in the tear fluid and conjunctival secretions of the severe or common type patients without conjunctivitis. While taking the tear fluid sample for testing, we obtained sputum samples from patients as control samples; 55 of the 60 sputum samples yielded positive results. This, to some extent, indicated that the tear and conjunctival secretions of patients without conjunctivitis were not an infectious route for SARS-CoV-2. At present, the transmission route of the novel coronavirus remains unclear, and many scholars believe that it may be transmitted through aerosols.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] However, the most commonly used non-contact tonometer for ophthalmologic examination sprays a gas during examination, which produces a large amount of aerosol in the local area. Moreover, aerosols may be concentrated in the local air for a long time, and general alcohol wipe disinfection is ineffective, causing great panic in the field of ophthalmology.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] According to the results of this study, no virus particles were detected in tear and conjunctival secretions in patients without conjunctivitis. Therefore, current routine disinfection can prevent the spread of the virus; non-contact tonometer, ultrasound biomicroscopy, corneal confocal microscope, and others do not theoretically cause cross infection. Low abundance of the virus in tear and conjunctival secretions does not eliminate the risk of transmission through conjunctival tissue. As ophthalmologists come into contact with patients at a close-range during examination, the saliva of infected patients may still cause infection among medical staff through conjunctival tissue; thus, goggles are still necessary protective measures.",
            "RT-PCR is an effective technique for detecting viral nucleic acid.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] Due to its high sensitivity and specificity, this method has the advantages of simplicity, convenience, and efficiency. Some scholars have found that RT-PCR is effective for diagnosing novel coronavirus through meta-analysis, is significantly better than smear dyeing inspection and culture identification and it has become the gold standard for the diagnosis of coronavirus infections. However, there are inevitably many false positive and false negative results, which are often caused by sample contamination and damage to genetic material.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] In 2003, some studies reported on the detection of virus particles in conjunctival secretions among SARS patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] Researchers in Hong Kong obtained conjunctival secretions and conjunctival cells from 17 confirmed cases and tested them via viral RT-PCR; the results were all negative. Researchers in Singapore also tested conjunctival secretions obtained from 34 highly suspected cases via RT-PCR assay, and found that three of the patients had positive results, although their pharyngeal secretions yielded negative results. Of course, the Singaporean researchers also mentioned the possibility of sample contamination during sampling, but due to the shortcomings of RT-PCR technology, the existence of false negatives could not be ruled out.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Based on the results of our research, we collected tear and conjunctival secretions twice at an interval of 2-3 days and the results showed good consistency. Therefore, we were sure that SARS-CoV-2 was existed in tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis. For patients without conjunctivitis, we detected no virus in tears and conjunctival secretions indicating that it is not a common route of its transmission. Nevertheless, the risk of transmission could not be completely eliminated.",
            "The present study assessed the tears and conjunctival secretions in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The results showed that virus was existed in the patients\u2019 tears and conjunctival secretions with conjunctivitis and there was no virus in the patients' conjunctival sac without conjunctivitis. However, this study had several limitations. Firstly, the included sample size was relatively small. Simultaneously, although the samples were collected by the professional ophthalmologist (JH, X), the collected tear and conjunctival secretions were limited, so sample concentration might be insufficient for RT-PCR detection of the virus.
