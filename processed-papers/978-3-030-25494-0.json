It is truly comprehensive, describing all methods, all acquisition parameters, and all interpretation criteria in all infectious diseases. The early chapters discuss currently available radiopharmaceuticals and nuclear medicine imaging technologies, including the hybrid modalities SPECT/CT, PET/CT, and PET/MRI. The remainder of the book is devoted to the nuclear medicine imaging of infections at different body sites as well as fever of unknown origin, fungal infections, and tuberculosis and AIDS-associated infections. Infections represent a real emergency globally, and early diagnosis and treatment follow-up will continue to pose huge challenges. In this context, Nuclear Medicine in Infectious Diseaseswill be a superb asset for nuclear medicine and infectious disease specialists and other clinicians everywhere.",
