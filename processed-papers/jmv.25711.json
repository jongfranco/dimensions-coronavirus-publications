            "Based on his primary laboratory report, chest radiograph, clinical and epidemiologic information, the patient received the treatment of interferon\u2010alpha and methylprednisolone. However, he was transferred to the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China on January 23, because of acute exacerbation of clinical symptoms including expiratory dyspnea, poor diet, and lethargy. The laboratory tests were shown in",
            "Table 1 (day 0). The results indicated the patient with stable vital signs, significantly decreased lymphocytes and increased c\u2010reactive protein but slightly elevated fibrinogen, neutrophil, lactic dehydrogenase, and fibrinogen. A computed tomography (CT) lung imaging was reported as showing the multiple patchy high\u2010density shadows scattered mainly in the border regions of lungs which were solid changes in which the air bronchogram sign was seen or ground\u2010glass opacifications changes, as well as slightly thickened pleura (Figure S1a). Combination therapy was initiated with lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (800/200 mg daily), methylprednisolone (40 mg daily), recombinant human interferon alfa\u20102b (10 million IU daily), ambroxol hydrochloride (60 mg daily) and moxifloxacin hydrochloride (0.4 g daily), to inhibit the virus replication, relieve asthma, resolve phlegm, and implement the empirical antibiotic treatment. In addition, the high flow humidification oxygen inhalation therapy was used for preventing acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The treatment of blood glucose, blood pressure, and rehydration therapy was performed. On the second day of treatment, the patient's temperature had low\u2010grade intermittent fevers (range from 36.0\u00b0C to 37.2\u00b0C). With the exception of occasional chest tightness and shortness of breath, the other symptoms including cough productive of white phlegm, stuffy and runny noses, vertigo, and fatigue were improved. On day 3 of treatment, methylprednisolone was reduced to 20 mg daily and withdraw on day 5. In addition, the high flow humidification oxygen inhalation therapy was removed until the 8th day of treatment, based on the markedly improved respiratory function. According to the persistent negative results of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 on days 6 and 7, as well as the lung lesions partially absorbed (Figure S1b), the patient was discharged on day 10. During treatment, the patient's body temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate had slight fluctuation (Figure S1c), and the laboratory results got better improvement, especially lymphocyte count (Table 1; day 8).",
            "In our patients, laboratory tests are necessary, especially the total lymphocyte count (TLC) which shows a significant decline. After recovery, the TLC reaches the normal level. Chest CT examination combined with the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA is helpful for the diagnosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Moreover, the patient, who failed to respond to methylprednisolone and interferon therapy in other hospitals, received additional lopinavir and ritonavir tablets therapy in our hospital and got a quick improvement of the clinical symptoms.",
