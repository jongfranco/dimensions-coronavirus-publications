            "One confirmed case in Nepal was a Nepalese student, studying in Wuhan, with symptom-onset on January 3. The infected 32-year-old male had returned on January 9 to spend winter holidays in Nepal. He had prior knowledge about the outbreak in China and visited the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) in Kathmandu on January 13.3 Taking into account his travel history, he was isolated and was given supportive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The throat swab sample of the person was sent to the WHO Collaborating Center, Hong Kong and was tested positive. There weren\u2019t any complications, except for a surge in temperature to 102\u00b0F on January 14, which then subsided on January 16. Upon clinical improvement, he was discharged on January 17, with a total 4 days in isolation. On January 25, the test results came back confirming COVID-19, although the man had been discharged. He was requested to remain under self-quarantine. Negative results for COVID-19 were given by consecutive follow-up tests on January 29 and 31.9"

        "Introduction": [
            "SARS, in 2003, spread both within a geographical region and, more significantly, to different cities from a single location, through infected travelers.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "Among the total number of tourists in 2018, 153633, the second-highest number, were Chinese tourists, with the highest influx during February and December.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] COVID-19 outbreak coincides with Chinese new year during which the Chinese travel extensively, increasing chances for transmission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Study into coronavirus infections in Nepal, has shown the incidence to be higher in winter (DecemberFebruary).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Nepal shares northern border with China with several border crossing points.",
            "One confirmed case in Nepal was a Nepalese student, studying in Wuhan, with symptom-onset on January 3."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "He had prior knowledge about the outbreak in China and visited the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) in Kathmandu on January 13.3 Taking into account his travel history, he was isolated and was given supportive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.",
            "On January 25, the test results came back confirming COVID-19, the man had been discharged.",
            "Negative results for COVID-19 were given by consecutive follow-up tests on January 29 and 31.9",
            "The sensitivity of such screening has not been assessed and its effectiveness could be reduced by asymptomatic cases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] To curb this issue, focus could be diverted towards improving awareness among travelers about the symptoms of COVID-19 and the algorithm to follow thereafter.",
            "Fifty-five isolation beds have been provisioned at the hub hospitals.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Isolation beds have been provisioned at three health science institutions in Gandaki-Province and in Surkhet Province Hospital in Karnali-Province and Lumbini Province Hospital in Province-5.3 Several sets of personal protective equipment (PPE) have been provisioned at the hospitals, with five sets on stand-by at TIA.The confirmatory real-time-RTPCR was introduced at National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), Kathmandu on January 27.",
            "Laboratory sample collection form developed by NPHL, reporting form for suspected COVID19 cases and contact listing form have been provided to all healthcare institutes.",
            "Information, education and communication materials have been disseminated via several forums and media with regular updates regarding COVID-19.3 On February 10, 86 healthcare workers were trained on quarantine and screening at the National Health Training Center."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Considering the possibility of travel of infected cases, high vigilance coupled with a strong response plan is required to address the current risk of COVID-19.",
            "A directive from the Government of Nepal is vital for educating the public to respond to the outbreak through necessary precautions and inform travelers about possible risk.",
            "COVID-19 and past outbreak scenarios should be a learning experience for Nepal not only on emergency management but towards developing a strong surveillance system and taking preventive actions for similar events in the future."
