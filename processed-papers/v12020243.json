        "abstract": "The discovery and characterization of novel arthropod-borne viruses provide valuable information on their genetic diversity, ecology, evolution and potential to threaten animal or public health. Arbovirus surveillance is not conducted regularly in Romania, being particularly very scarce in the remote and diverse areas like the Danube Delta. Here we describe the detection and genetic characterization of a novel orbivirus (Reoviridae: Orbivirus) designated as Letea virus, which was found in grass snakes (Natrix natrix) during a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic survey conducted between 2014 and 2017. This virus is the first orbivirus discovered in reptiles. Phylogenetic analyses placed Letea virus as a highly divergent species in the Culicoides-/sand fly-borne orbivirus clade. Gene reassortment and intragenic recombination were detected in the majority of the nine Letea virus strains obtained, implying that these mechanisms play important roles in the evolution and diversification of the virus. However, the screening of arthropods, including Culicoides biting midges collected within the same surveillance program, tested negative for Letea virus infection and could not confirm the arthropod vector of the virus. The study provided complete genome sequences for nine Letea virus strains and new information about orbivirus diversity, host range, ecology and evolution. The phylogenetic associations warrant further screening of arthropods, as well as sustained surveillance efforts for elucidation of Letea virus natural cycle and possible implications for animal and human health.",

            "In conclusion, a novel orbivirus (LEAV) was identified and characterized, expanding the known host range of orbiviruses and revealing its genetic relationship to the Orbivirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates LEAV as a potentially Culicoides-borne orbivirus, although this was not confirmed by the screening of Culicoides midges and other arthropods from the DDBR. LEAV failed to replicate in vitro in several types of cells, which may warrant further attempts using additional cell types. The discovery and characterization of LEAV offers valuable information, expanding our knowledge about the evolution and host range of orbiviruses. The phylogenetic associations can justify further screening of arthropods and continued surveillance in order to describe the natural cycle of LEAV and its possible impact on vertebrate hosts."

All samples collected from N. tessellata (n = 63) tested negative (Table S1), as did all arthropod samples (ticks, mosquitoes and Culicoides) analyzed for the presence of LEAV RNA.

            "Reptiles are known as hosts of numerous viruses. However, limited or fragmentary evidence is available regarding their role in arboviral cycles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. The present study investigated the possibility that natricine snakes harbor arboviruses by screening sera collected from sympatric populations of grass snakes (N. natrix) and dice snakes (N. tessellata) from the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve in Romania. Thus, we described for the first time the discovery and genetic characterization of a novel orbivirus species (Letea virus, LEAV) infecting reptiles.<br/><br/>Inclusion and demarcation of species within the Orbivirus genus considers several criteria, such as sequence identity of segments encoding the polymerase (VP1) and major subcore shell protein T2, gene reassortment between close strains, high levels of serological cross-reactivity against conserved antigens like the T13 protein, conservation of UTR terminal nucleotides, range of hosts and vectors or the clinical signs associated with orbivirus infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. We propose that LEAV should be included in the Orbivirus genus as a separate species, based on the comparative and phylogenetic analyses reported herein. In addition to a typical orbivirus genomic architecture of 10 linear segments of dsRNA, the UTRs of LEAV include conserved terminal sequences similar to other orbiviruses. The LEAV terminal nucleotides are not conserved hexanucleotides as in the case of BTV or AHSV, but heptanucleotides showing little variation among the 10 segments. Distal dinucleotides at both of the UTR ends are inverted complements (Table 1), as shown in other orbiviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]."

            "Reptiles are known as hosts of numerous viruses. However, limited or fragmentary evidence is available regarding their role in arboviral cycles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. The present study investigated the possibility that natricine snakes harbor arboviruses by screening sera collected from sympatric populations of grass snakes (N. natrix) and dice snakes (N. tessellata) from the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve in Romania. Thus, we described for the first time the discovery and genetic characterization of a novel orbivirus species (Letea virus, LEAV) infecting reptiles.",
            "Inclusion and demarcation of species within the Orbivirus genus considers several criteria, such as sequence identity of segments encoding the polymerase (VP1) and major subcore shell protein T2, gene reassortment between close strains, high levels of serological cross-reactivity against conserved antigens like the T13 protein, conservation of UTR terminal nucleotides, range of hosts and vectors or the clinical signs associated with orbivirus infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. We propose that LEAV should be included in the Orbivirus genus as a separate species, based on the comparative and phylogenetic analyses reported herein. In addition to a typical orbivirus genomic architecture of 10 linear segments of dsRNA, the UTRs of LEAV include conserved terminal sequences similar to other orbiviruses. The LEAV terminal nucleotides are not conserved hexanucleotides as in the case of BTV or AHSV, but heptanucleotides showing little variation among the 10 segments. Distal dinucleotides at both of the UTR ends are inverted complements (Table 1), as shown in other orbiviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>].",

            "The amino acid identity observed in the polymerase is above the 30% threshold defined by [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] for inclusion in the Orbivirus genus (Table 2). The protein sequence of LEAV T2 (VP3) showed identity levels significantly lower than the 91% cutoff indicated for this protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], confirming that LEAV is a distinct orbivirus species. Furthermore, the nine different LEAV strains belong to the same species, as their T2 amino acid sequences are >98% identical. Additional taxonomical markers of orbiviruses are the VP2 (outer capsid 1 in C/SBOV) and VP7 (T13) proteins, determining the serotype and serogroup, respectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. The core surface protein T13 forms the outer layer of the viral core and is the primary antigenic constituent of virus serogroup (species) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. The low amino acid identity of LEAV T13 (Table 2) to other T13 proteins confirms that this virus belongs to a distinct serogroup. VP2 is encoded on segment-2 in LEAV and functionally equivalent to VP3 of MBOV and VP4 of TBOV/TOV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>]. Due to its neutralizing epitopes and role in cell attachment, the VP2 (OC1) protein is subjected to intense selective pressures by the host\u2019s immune responses. Thus, it is one of the most variable orbiviral proteins [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Unsurprisingly, we found significant levels of identity for LEAV VP2 (10\u201315%) only in comparison with IBOV proteins. Moreover, the high amino acid identity (>98%) found between VP2 of the nine LEAV strains showed that all sequences belong to the same LEAV serotype.",
            "Previous studies noted that the overall GC content and the UTR proportion relative to the genome\u2019s length reflect three groups similar to those illustrated by phylogenetic analyses. First, the GC content is highest in TBOV with 52\u201357.3% GC, followed by the C/SBOV with 39.9\u201345.9% GC and the MBOV with 36.7\u201341.6% GC [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. The GC content of LEAV is 34.6\u201334.9%, therefore below these intervals. Second, the UTRs of C/SBOV span 3.5\u20134.1% of their total genome length, in TBOV the UTRs are between ~4.5\u20135% and in MBOV ~5\u20135.7% of the virus genome [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]. Again, LEAV falls outside these limits, having the proportion of UTRs at 6.64% of the genome\u2019s length, which is higher than in other orbiviruses.",
            "Apart from the high mutation rate owing to a polymerase lacking proofreading activity, reassortment of cognate genomic segments is an important driver of genetic diversity in viruses with segmented RNA genomes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>]. This process can generate novel phenotypes with fundamental implications for immune escape, host or vector range, virulence and pathogenicity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. The ability to reassort genomic segments is a primary criterion for inclusion in the Reoviridae family [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] and it may have contributed to the great evolutionary success of this family. Most natural cases of orbivirus reassortment have been described in BTV studies, mostly due to its antigenic diversity, wide geographic range, but also economic importance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>]. Additionally, reassortment has been described in EHDV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>], CORV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>], CGLV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>] and Banna orbivirus (BAOV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>]. We found that reassortment between LEAV strains involved segment-4 (VP4), segment-7 (T13) and segment-9 (VP6) in eight of nine genomes analyzed. We speculate on another segment exchange where LEAV strain NN28SUL16 received its segment-3 (T2) from an unidentified LEAV parental strain, due to the striking sequence divergence of NN28SUL16 segment-3 within a highly similar (>98%) VP3 dataset (Figure 3 and Figure S3). When translated to protein sequence, the identity of this segment to the rest of the LEAV homologs was \u226598.9%, confirming the necessity of its structural conservation.",
            "Intragenic recombination between segments of LEAV was detected in the majority of LEAV strains (Figure 3, Table S4). The effective contribution of each mechanism generating diversity in segmented viruses is far from being understood. Against a backdrop of rapid mutation, the formation of mosaic genes along with reassortment can have compounding effects on viral fitness. As in the case of sand fly-borne Changuinola (CGLV) serogroup [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>], the strain biodiversity could be an important factor for the occurrence of RNA segment/fragment exchange in LEAV. This is indicated by detections of reassortment and intragenic recombination in eight, respectively seven, of nine LEAV strains. This is all the more clear for orbiviruses with great antigenic diversity like BTV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>] and AHSV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c68\" href=\"#r68\">68</a>], but also for orthoreoviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>] and rotaviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>].",
            "Despite field efforts parallel to sera collection and the significant LEAV prevalence in grass snakes (7.89%), none of the screened arthropod pools or individuals tested positive for LEAV RNA. Also, recent analyses of mosquito and Culicoides host-feeding patterns in DDBR did not indicate ectothermic species as hosts of these insects (with very few exceptions provided by frogs fed upon by mosquitoes) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Reoviruses known to infect reptiles belong to the turreted group of the family (subfamily Spinareovirinae, e.g., Reptilian orthoreovirus) and cause severe illness of digestive and respiratory organs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c76\" href=\"#r76\">76</a>]. The grass snake and dice snake occur sympatrically across the study area. In Dun\u0103rea Veche and Sulina we could observe some ecological features (bank structure, water body type, prey, microhabitat usage) very similar to those described for other European populations, indicating ecological partitioning in syntopic populations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>]. Although we encountered more N. tessellata in the aforementioned sites, LEAV was not detected in the sera of this species. Infected grass snakes showed no sign of disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of orbivirus detection in reptiles.",
            "All attempts of growing and isolating LEAV on insect or vertebrate cell lines showed no cytopathic effect or silent replication of the virus. Most known orbiviruses grow easily in vertebrate cells in vitro, while a few are known to be restricted to insect cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c79\" href=\"#r79\">79</a>]. Although LEAV isolation could be further attempted on additional cell lines, we may speculate a shift in cell tropism underlying the inability of LEAV to infect certain cell types. A similar case is Parry\u2019s Lagoon virus (PLV), a serotype of CORV. In contrast to the wide vertebrate host range of CORV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>], the antigenically related PLV showed a distinct cell tropism and replicated only in insect cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>]. With the available data we may speculate that such shifts in cell tropism could be the result of successive changes through recombination, genetic drift and shift. Reoviridae is a very successful family of segmented dsRNA viruses, having wide host ranges across various econiches. The family\u2019s repertoire of evolutionary strategies also includes deletion [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>], gene duplication and concatemerisation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>].

This suggests an increased potential for \u201cspecies jumps\u201d and adaptation to new vectors and/or hosts [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>].",
            "Earlier studies associated a conserved Arg-Gly-Asp (167RGD171) motif on the T13 protein of BTV with the attachment to Culicoides cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>]. This conserved motif was also found by later studies in some species closely related to BTV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>], but we did not observed it in LEAV. As with other orbivirus species, this may reflect the higher divergence relative to BTV. Although the phylogenetic analyses indicate LEAV as a potentially Culicoides-borne orbivirus, it is interesting to note some general inconsistencies in vector associations of IBOV (C/SBOV and MBOV). For example, phylogenetic analyses place Orungo virus (ORUV), Lembombo virus (LEBV), Pata virus (PATAV) and Japanaut virus (JAPV) in the C/SBOV clade, even though they were discovered in mosquitoes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>]. For ORUV, follow-up studies on mosquito transmission were inconclusive [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>]. Interestingly, Tracamb\u00e9 virus (TRV), a serotype of the sand fly-borne CGLV serogroup, was isolated from mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles (Reoviridae.org). Some serotypes of C/SBOV have been isolated from both mosquitoes and biting midges: Eubenangee virus (EUBV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>], Palyam virus (PALV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>], Warrego virus WARV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], Wongorr virus (WGRV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], and Tibet orbivirus (TIBOV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]. The associations between some viruses and more than one vector family could be the result of \u201cspecies jumps\u201d permitted by fast evolution characteristic of RNA segmented viruses. Such occurrences in members of the Orbivirus genus would not necessarily run counter to the \u201ccoevolution\u201d hypothesis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>], but possibly complement it.",
            "In conclusion, a novel orbivirus (LEAV) was identified and characterized, expanding the known host range of orbiviruses and revealing its genetic relationship to the Orbivirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates LEAV as a potentially Culicoides-borne orbivirus, although this was not confirmed by the screening of Culicoides midges and other arthropods from the DDBR. LEAV failed to replicate in vitro in several types of cells, which may warrant further attempts using additional cell types. The discovery and characterization of LEAV offers valuable information, expanding our knowledge about the evolution and host range of orbiviruses. The phylogenetic associations can justify further screening of arthropods and continued surveillance in order to describe the natural cycle of LEAV and its possible impact on vertebrate hosts."
