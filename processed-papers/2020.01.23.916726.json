        "abstract": "We present a timely evaluation of the Chinese 2019-nCov epidemic in its initial phase, where 2019-nCov demonstrates comparable transmissibility but lower fatality rates than SARS and MERS. A quick diagnosis that leads to case isolation and integrated interventions will have a major impact on its future trend. Nevertheless, as China is facing its Spring Festival travel rush and the epidemic has spread beyond its borders, further investigation on its potential spatiotemporal transmission pattern and novel intervention strategies are warranted.",

            "The basic reproduction number (R0) of 2019-nCov, an indication of the initial transmissibility of the virus, was estimated to be 4.71 (4.50-4.92) when the epidemic started on 12th December 2019, but its effective reproduction number (Re) has dropped to 2.08 (1.99-2.18) as of 22th January 2020 (Figure 1b).",
            "Diagnosis for quarantine and integrated interventions are essential for curbing the epidemic.",
            "If the current intervention continues, the number of infected individuals is expected to peak in early March 2020 (80 days since initiation) with a peak population size of 827 (421-1232) infectious individuals in China.",
            "The authors' model indicates that every one-day reduction in this duration would reduce the peak population size by 72-84% and the cumulative infected cases and deaths both by 68-80% (Figure 1c,d).",
            "The authors estimate that every additional 10% decay in the transmission rate due to integrated interventions would reduce the peak population size by 20-47%, the cumulative infected cases and deaths both by 23-49% (Figure 1c,d)."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Facing the rapidly rising epidemic, the Chinese government has timely amended the Law of the PRC on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases on 20th January 2020 to include the 2019-nCov as a class-B infection but manage it as a class-A infection due to its severity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "The authors present a timely evaluation of the Chinese 2019-nCov epidemic in its initial phase, where 2019-nCov demonstrates comparable transmissibility but lower fatality rates than SARS and MERS.",
            "As China is facing its \u2018Spring Festival travel rush\u2019 and the epidemic has spread beyond its borders, further investigation on its potential spatiotemporal transmission pattern and novel intervention strategies are warranted."
