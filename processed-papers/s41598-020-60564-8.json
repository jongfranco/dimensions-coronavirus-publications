        "abstract": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, causes serious losses to the poultry industry. Intestinal microbiota play an important role in chicken health and contribute to the defence against colonization by invading pathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the link between the intestinal microbiome and nephropathogenic IBV (NIBV) infection. Initially, chickens were randomly distributed into 2 groups: the normal group (INC) and the infected group (IIBV). The ilea were collected for morphological assessment, and the ileal contents were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The results of the IIBV group analyses showed a significant decrease in the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P < 0.05), while the goblet cells increased compared to those in the INC group. Furthermore, the microbial diversity in the ilea decreased and overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae and underrepresentation of Chloroplast and Clostridia was found in the NIBVinfected chickens. In conclusion, these results showed that the significant separation of the two groups and the characterization of the gut microbiome profiles of the chickens with NIBV infection may provide valuable information and promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of this disease.",

These clinical symptoms were not observed in the INC group. The quantification of the viral load by RT-qPCR showed values ranging from 2.96 \u00d7 103 to 3.84 \u00d7 108 genomic copies per 0.2 \u03bcg of RNA, with the lowest viral load in the jejuna and the highest in the kidneys (Fig. 1B). It was noted that the viral load in the ilea was much higher than that in the jejuna, reaching 1.39 \u00d7 105 genomic copies per 0.2 \u03bcg of RNA. No viral RNA was detected in the INC group. There were more goblet cells, which appeared as vacuoles when stained by H&E, in the IIBV group than in the INC group (Fig. 1C, red arrow). In addition, there were many shed villus epithelial tissue that appeared in the ilea of the IIBV group (Fig. 1C, black arrow).

            "The gut microbiome contains very diverse bacteria and influences myriad host functions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Under pathological conditions, the microbial community composition changes, including an increase and decrease in bacterial populations, causing changes in a wide rage of metabolic functions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Accordingly, it is certainly necessary to understand the bacterial community composition and changes in gut microbiota with IBV infection. However, the composition of the gut microbiota and how the coronavirus can affect the gut microbiota are still unclear. Therefore, the effects of IBV infection on chicken ileum damage and the ileum microbiome were investigated in our study by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been applied extensively for assessing the phylogenetic distribution of metagenomes. It is known that the bacterial 16S rRNA gene consists of nine hypervariable regions, and sequences generated by applying different combinations of these regions generally present differing profiles of microbial diversity. Therefore, the optimal choice of the hypervariable region(s) and primer combination vary between various ecological communities. Previous research proved that the highest bacterial diversity and species richness in chicken gut microbiomes were obtained using the primer set corresponding to the V3-V4 region[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Based on these investigations, in our study, we selected primers targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene."

At the affected farm, the diseased chickens had the same clinical symptoms: the kidney parenchyma of the dead birds was pale, swollen and mottled. These results show that the IBV strain SX9 has strong nephropathogenic characteristics. The IBV strain SX9 used in this study was propagated in 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated eggs (Jinan sais poultry Co., Ltd., Shandong, China) by the allantoic route. The IBV viral titer (median embryo lethal dose, ELD50) was evaluated in the 10-day-old SPF eggs and calculated by the Reed-Muench method."

            "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, causes serious losses to the poultry industry. Intestinal microbiota play an important role in chicken health and contribute to the defence against colonization by invading pathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the link between the intestinal microbiome and nephropathogenic IBV (NIBV) infection. Initially, chickens were randomly distributed into 2 groups: the normal group (INC) and the infected group (IIBV). The ilea were collected for morphological assessment, and the ileal contents were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The results of the IIBV group analyses showed a significant decrease in the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P < 0.05), while the goblet cells increased compared to those in the INC group. Furthermore, the microbial diversity in the ilea decreased and overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae and underrepresentation of Chloroplast and Clostridia was found in the NIBVinfected chickens. In conclusion, these results showed that the significant separation of the two groups and the characterization of the gut microbiome profiles of the chickens with NIBV infection may provide valuable information and promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of this disease.",
            "Based on the revolution in our understanding of host-microbial interactions in the past two decades, it has been recognized that the gut microbiome is exceedingly complex[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. We have at least 100 trillion (1014) microbial bacteria and a quadrillion viruses in and on us[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Collectively, the microbial bacteria that are located in and on the body make up our microbiota, and the genes they encode are recognized as our microbiome. Numerous studies have shown that the role of intestinal flora includes nutrient absorption, mucosal barrier fortification, xenobiotic metabolism, angiogenesis, immunity, and response to infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. In human studies, many diseases are closely related to anomalies of the intestinal microbial community, comprising of liver cirrhosis, allergies, obesity, diabetes and so on[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Indeed, indigenous microbiota play a crucial part in the prevention and therapy of microbial infections and are frequently referred to as a \u201cforgotten organ\u201d[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Our recognition of the gut microbiota and the identification of its composition when contrasted between diseased and healthy states allow the determination of dysbacteriosis, which may be associated with disease progression; thus, this may serve as a new way to diagnose, prevent and treat interventions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]."

            "Viral load and histopathology.  All the NIBV-infected chickens in the IIBV group were listless, huddled together, had watery faeces, and displayed ruffled feathers (score = 2, according to the methods described by Avellaneda et al.24) from 3 to 9 days post-inoculation (dpi), and the morbidity was higher than 90%. These clinical symptoms were not observed in the INC group. The quantification of the viral load by RT-qPCR showed values ranging from 2.96 \u00d7 103 to 3.84 \u00d7 108 genomic copies per 0.2 \u03bcg of RNA, with the lowest viral load in the jejuna and the highest in the kidneys (Fig. 1B). It was noted that the viral load in the ilea was much higher than that in the jejuna, reaching 1.39 \u00d7 105 genomic copies per 0.2 \u03bcg of RNA. No viral RNA was detected in the INC group. There were more goblet cells, which appeared as vacuoles when stained by H&E, in the IIBV group than in the INC group (Fig. 1C, red arrow). In addition, there were many shed villus epithelial tissue that appeared in the ilea of the IIBV group (Fig. 1C, black arrow). Among the ilea, there was no significant difference in villus height (Student\u2019s t test, P = 0.094, Fig. 1D), but crypt depth was significantly increased (Student\u2019s t test, P = 0.0003, Fig. 1E), and the V/C ratio was significantly decreased (Student\u2019s t test, P = 0.016, Fig. 1F).",

After two separate runs on an Illumina HiSeq. 2500 platform and quality-filtering as described in the methods, 698,855 total sequences were identified for further analysis. The rarefaction curves (Fig. 2a) showed that the sequencing depth was near saturation and that the sequencing data included most of the 16S rRNA gene information in the samples.",

The sample community richness was evaluated based on the operational taxonomic units (OTU)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] counts in each single sample as shown in Table 1. As shown by the OTU counts, the number of OTUs in the ilea of the IIBV group chickens was less than that of the INC group chickens (Fig. 2b). According to the lower ACE and Chao[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] indices, NIBV infection reduced the community richness compared to that in the INC group (Table 1). In addition, neither the Shannon nor the Simpson indices were significantly different between the IIBV group and the INC group within the experiment (Wilcox, P = 0.5887 and P = 0.9372, respectively). The higher Shannon and Simpson index indicated a higher bacterial diversity, which meant that the NIBV infection decreased the microbial diversity compared to that in the INC group (Fig. 2c,d). In conclusion, these data indicated a smaller bacterial diversity in the ileal microbiota of NIBV infected chickens.",
            "NIBV infection altered the ileal bacterial microbiome composition in chickens.  To compare the global differences in the bacterial community composition between the NIBV infected chickens and the INC group chickens, the Bray-Curtis similarity and unweighted UniFrac[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] were calculated (Fig. 3a). We also performed nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] of all the samples using count-based Bray-Curtis similarity at the OTU level to explore the differences in the bacterial community composition among the two main groups of chickens[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. As shown in Fig. 3b, the results provided good discrimination between the groups, suggesting that the bacterial community composition of the IIBV group was different from that of the INC group. Simper (similarity percentage) is a decomposition of the Bray-Curtis difference index, which quantifies the contribution of each species to the difference between the two groups. The results showed the top 10 species in the genus level and their contributions to the differences between the two groups (Fig. 3c).",

Figure 3d is a UniFrac PCoA-based comparison of the microbial community from the ilea, showing that the NIBV-infected chickens and the normal chickens had a clear separation. In addition, analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) based on the Bray-Curtis distance (R-value = 0.413, P = 0.002, Fig. 3e) and analysis of molecular variance[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] based on the weighted UniFrac distance (P-value = 0.027, AMOVA) showed a significant separation of the two groups.

Notably, at the phylum level, the abundance of Firmicutes decreased (from 89.21% to 75.44%) in the IIBV group compared to that in the INC group, whereas there was an increase in the abundances of Proteobacteria (from 2.36%",
            "to 16.89%) and Bacteroidetes (from 1.91% to 6.69%) (Fig. 4a). Evidently, Lactobacillaceae, belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, was the most abundant family in the ileum. The family Clostridiaceae 1 had significantly lower abundance in the IIBV group than in the INC group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4b). Lactobacillus, belonging to the family Lactobacillaceae, was the most abundant genus in the ilea. The genus Candidatus Arthromitus, belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, and the genus unidentified Chloroplast, belonging to the phylum Cyanobacteria, were significantly less abundant in the IIBV group than in the INC group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4c).",

Six pathways were enriched in the IIBV group: other ion-coupled transporters; secondary bile acid biosynthesis; primary bile acid biosynthesis; nucleotide metabolism; nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism; and toluene degradation (Fig. 5).

        "Discussion": [
            "The gut microbiome contains very diverse bacteria and influences myriad host functions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Under pathological conditions, the microbial community composition changes, including an increase and decrease in bacterial populations, causing changes in a wide rage of metabolic functions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Accordingly, it is certainly necessary to understand the bacterial community composition and changes in gut microbiota with IBV infection. However, the composition of the gut microbiota and how the coronavirus can affect the gut microbiota are still unclear. Therefore, the effects of IBV infection on chicken ileum damage and the ileum microbiome were investigated in our study by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been applied extensively for assessing the phylogenetic distribution of metagenomes. It is known that the bacterial 16S rRNA gene consists of nine hypervariable regions, and sequences generated by applying different combinations of these regions generally present differing profiles of microbial diversity. Therefore, the optimal choice of the hypervariable region(s) and primer combination vary between various ecological communities. Previous research proved that the highest bacterial diversity and species richness in chicken gut microbiomes were obtained using the primer set corresponding to the V3-V4 region[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Based on these investigations, in our study, we selected primers targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene.",
            "The complete intestinal structure is essential for digestive and absorptive functions which are intimately associated with the morphological transformations in villus length and crypt depth[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. In the current study, NIBV infection increased the crypt depth and lowered the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the ileum compared to those in the INC group. These findings suggest that NIBV infection can destroy intestinal mucosal integrity and may slow the growth of intestinal villus epithelial cells. Furthermore, it was reported that intestinal goblet cells play a crucial defensive role in the intestine by synthesizing and secreting several mediators, including mucins and trefoil factor family peptides, which serve defensive and healing functions in the gut[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. In this study, NIBV infection obviously increased the number of goblet cells compared to that in the normal group, which indicated hyperplasia of the goblet cells in the ileum during NIBV infection and may be associated with microbial challenges.",
            "Higher diversity and integrity of gut microbiota is favourable to the intestinal ecosystem[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. According to recent research, viral infection can lower microbial diversity in the gut microbiota according to recent research[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. Consistent with previous findings, in this study, our results demonstrated that NIBV infection decreases the diversity and richness of gut microbiota (Fig. 2c and Table 1). The analysis of the taxonomic composition displayed a reduction in the Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria phyla and an enrichment of the phylum Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the ilea. Importantly, the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli, was increased in the ilea",
            "of NIBV-infected chickens. Moreover, the LEfSe results showed that Enterobacteriaceae belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria were over-represented in the IIBV group. Previous research shows that in the case of intestinal inflammation, epithelial cells reduce their capacity to undergo beta-oxidation, with the consequence of an increased availability of oxygen, which is thought to promote the bloom of Proteobacteria and the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. Further investigations acknowledged that nitrate produced by the host during inflammatory conditions can be exploited by commensal Enterobacteriaceae, which thus become predominant[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]. Therefore, the increased enrichment of Proteobacteria revealed that the intestinal inflammation in the ilea of NIBV-infected chickens represent a \u201cmicrobial signature\u201d of NIBV infection. The results also showed that NIBV infection decreased the abundance of the members of the Cyanobacteria in the ilea compared to that in the INC group chickens. The Cyanobacteria group has great biodiversity due to its secondary metabolites, which show a broad variety of biological activities, including antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer and immunomodulator or protease inhibitor activities[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]. Our results showed a reduction in Cyanobacteria, which indicated that the ability of the chicken ileum to clear viruses was weakened by NIBV infection. Clearly, in the case of viral infection, changes in general metabolic function are closely related to the gain and loss of microbial populations.",
            "Multiple studies suggest that gut microbiota influences the host metabolism[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. Cox et al showed that disruption of microbiota (reduction in Allobaculum, Lactobacillus, Rikenellaceae and Candidatus Arthromitus (segmented filamentous bacteria, SFB54)) can induce obesity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>]. In the present study, we found that Candidatus Arthromitus was dramatically reduced in the IIBV group compared to that in the INC group. However, due to the lack of records of body weight and body fat percentage (BFP) data, it was difficult to verify the direct effect of the reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes, such as Candidatus Arthromitus, on the body in this experiment. Fortunately, in the present study, we predicted the unobserved character states in the bacterial community by using PICRUSt, which is generally applied to investigate animal intestinal function[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>]. With respect to the PICRUSt results, the \u201cprimary bile acid biosynthesis\u201d and \u201csecondary bile acid biosynthesis\u201d pathways were significantly enriched in the ilea of the IIBV group chickens. Bile acids are cholesterol-derived compounds synthesized in the liver, and gut microbiota can transfer primary bile acids in the small intestine via deconjugation, dehydroxylation, or dehydrogenation to form so-called secondary bile acids, which promote the intestinal absorption of lipids and affect energy metabolism mainly via the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled receptor (TGR5)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. A great number of observational studies have indicated that meta-inflammatory disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), are always associated with an increase in total bile acid (BA) concentrations[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>]. In addition, Annika et al showed that the levels of iso-DCA, which is a common BA produced by bacteria, were significantly increased in humanized mice with low Clostridia abundance. As highlighted above, we know that the enrichment of bile acid biosynthesis is closely related to the loss of Clostridia, which may act as an important part of host metabolism in response to NIBV infections.",
            "In conclusion, existing literature highlights the vital role of gut microbiota in the defence against viral infection. Our results suggested that relative abundance data from the ileal microbiota may differentiate the INC group chickens from the IIBV group chickens infected with NIBV. Microbiome profiles could be a biological indicator www.nature.com/scientificreports of IBV infection; therefore, further investigation into the mechanism of this shift will help us understand IBV infection and provide a new approach to diagnose, prevent and treat infections."
