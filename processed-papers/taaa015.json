            "Coronaviruses, enveloped RNA viruses with surface spikes, infect a wide range of animals and humans. They can cause mild, self-limited upper respiratory infections in humans (the common cold). A few coronaviruses, normally carried by apparently healthy animals, can be lethal if they infect humans. For many viruses that primarily infect animals but can spill over into the human population, humans are dead-end hosts. Examples include the rabies virus and most hantaviruses. With these, transmission to other humans does not occur, or does so rarely."

These countries all have high Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) scores that suggest greater capacity to respond to outbreaks.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] The IDVI is a validated tool that estimates a country\u2019s capacity to manage infectious disease threats and includes metrics defining health care, public health, demographics, economics, political and other factors.",
            "Many lessons were learned from the SARS outbreak almost 20 years ago. The virus causing the cluster of pneumonia cases in December 2019 in Wuhan was identified and sequenced promptly, and genetic sequences were shared with the global community in early January 2020.2 What was not apparent\u2014 or not shared initially\u2014was that the virus was spreading from human to human. After initial reassurances that no humanto-human spread was occurring, infections exploded in many locations and the virus has now infected thousands in China and has spread to more than 24 countries\u2014a number that continues to increase. Local transmission is also occurring outside of China.",
            "The size and reach of today\u2019s global travel network means that locally emerging pathogens have the capacity to disperse rapidly. The greatest danger is posed by pathogens that can spread by the respiratory route, especially if airborne spread occurs. Other factors that make control of a pathogen more difficult include transmissibility during asymptomatic, mild or pre-symptomatic periods. A long infectious period also makes control more challenging. The virus that has emerged in Wuhan combines characteristics that do not bode well for the human population. Based on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (potential range 2\u2013 14 days), the number of cases doubled every 7.4 days, and each case was estimated to infect 2.2 others.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] This basic reproductive number is similar to an estimate of 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5\u2013 3.5) reached by researchers with simulated epidemic trajectories using a mathematical model.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Modelling results suggest that control measures would need to block >60% of transmission to control the outbreak.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Based on observations with SARS and other infections, the basic reproductive number may decrease as people become aware of the threat of infection and change behaviour, but the basic reproductive number must drop <1 to stop the epidemic. The analysis based on the model suggests there will be ongoing sustained transmission in the absence of effective interventions.",
            "A simulation study to assess the effectiveness of airport exit screening concluded that >60% of infected travellers would not be detected using plausible assumptions based on the current situation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] The simulation was based on early and incomplete information but uses the best estimates available to date. Entry screening could detect a larger number of infections because of the potential for developing symptoms during the flight, especially during long flights. The investigators conclude that exit or entry airport screening for symptoms and use of thermal scanners is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of those infected to prevent entry of infection into new areas.",

Given the absence of vaccines or treatment at present, detection and isolation of cases will be the primary tool to control spread. Although work has already begun on therapeutics and vaccines, good medical care will be the mainstay of management in the near term. Early observations suggest that older individuals and those with chronic diseases will likely bear the greatest burden of disease.",
            "Research is urgently needed to define the clinical spectrum, effective screening approaches, incubation and infectivity periods, routes of human-to-human transmission, best infection control and management practices and potential specific treatment modalities. Bats are the likely reservoir host,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] but it is essential to identify any amplifying or transmitting animal hosts and alternative routes of transmission to humans.",
            "Travellers have already played a central role in the dispersal of this virus. Accurate diagnostic tests are not yet available to all who need them. It is desirable to focus resources on the most vulnerable places and populations. For example, among the top 20 countries receiving air travellers from Wuhan, Bali, Indonesia ranks lowest on the IDVI.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Can the IDVI be used to identify places needing more support?9 Analysis of commercial air traffic can help to identify cities and regions most likely to receive infected travellers.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Many issues relevant to travellers will require constant updating with the best, current information on transmissibility, spread and vulnerability (see Box 1).",
            "The wet market in Wuhan has been closed for the time being, but large numbers of similar markets exist elsewhere. Major threats to human health have come from animal viruses that have infected humans. Although one can never eliminate all contact with animal viruses, it is time to develop guidelines to markedly reduce the extensive contact with wild animal tissues, excreta and fluids that occurs with the handling, butchering and selling multiple species of animals for food. A One Health perspective is needed to integrate data from human and animal health and develop policies that protect and preserve the health of multiple populations.",
