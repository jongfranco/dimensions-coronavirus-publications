            "In Chapter 26, Kyungjun Yun and T. J. Lah examine key issues in South Korean environmental policies. South Korea\u2019s environmental performance remains at a relatively low level compared to its economic performance, though the government has endeavored to cope with the environmental problems of each period. The first half of this chapter discusses the trends and issues of South Korean environmental policy by identifying the historical stages of the environmental policy and explaining the characteristics of each stage. Also noted are the policy changes that have emerged since the new political regime began in 2017. The latter half of the chapter reviews some of the critical environmental issues facing South Korean society at present, including GHG emissions, air quality, water quality, and water supply and sanitation, offering some problem-solving approaches."
