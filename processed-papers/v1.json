        "abstract": "A new mysterious coronavirus outbreak started last month in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) termed the new virus strain 2019-nCoV to be the seventh reported human coronaviruses (HCoV). A seafood market in Wuhan city, central China was the starting point of the emergence with unknown animal causes the first animal to human infection. Until today 904 confirmed deaths and more than 40000 cases confirmed in China and 28 countries. There is a massive fear of the human to human transmission of 2019-nCoV that reported last week by the Chinese government. The most famous two strains of HCoV are the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV). The former had emerged in China in 2002 while the latter emerged in the Middle East region in 2012 and south Korea in 2015. In this study, the newly emerged 2019-nCoV papain-like protease (PLpro) is targeted by anti-SARS PLpro drugs and the anti-Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-structural protein 3 (NS3) serine protease drugs. Sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to get a valid model for 2019-nCoV PLpro. The results suggest the effectiveness of the anti-SARS drugs (GRL-0667, GRL-0617, and Mycophenolic acid) and the anti-HCV drugs (Grazoprevir, Telaprevir, and Boceprevir) as potent inhibitors against the newly emerged coronavirus.",

The binding energies for 2019-nCoV PLpro are slightly less than that calculated for SARS PLpro and HCV. On the other hand, at least seven interactions are established between 2019-nCoV PLpro and each tested compound in this study (either H-bonds or hydrophobic interactions) suggesting possible targeting of 2019-nCoV PLpro using anti-SARS and anti-HCV drugs."

            "Wuhan's novel coronavirus has a significant health concern since the last outbreak of these types of viruses. SARS in the year 2002 to 2003 in China left more than 700 deaths and 8000 cases in hospitals. Middle East region has an entirely different infection pattern of MERS leaving again about 800 deaths and 2500 hospitalizations. The present study aimed to test and suggest possible inhibitor drugs used against SARS and HCV proteases. Both anti-SARS PLpro (GRL-0667, GRL-0617, and Mycophenolic acid) and anti-HCV NS3 (Telaprevir, Boceprevir, and Grazoprevir) can bind to the active site of 2019-nCoV PLpro and hence, may contradict viral replication.

The symptoms include fever, malaise, dry cough, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress 1.",
            "2019-nCoV is a member of Betacoronaviruses family such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Human coronavirus (SARS HCoV (8000 infections from which 774 dead)) and the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Human coronavirus (MERS HCoV (2500 infections from which 858 dead)) 8,9. All the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are zoonotic viruses that transmit from animals to humans through direct contact. Until today, seven different strains of Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported, including the newly emerged 2019-nCoV 1,10. 229E and NL63 strains of HCoVs belong to Alphacoronaviruses while OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and 2019-nCoV HCoVs belong to Betacoronaviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. SARS and MERS HCoV are the most aggressive strains of coronaviruses, leaving about 800 deaths each. SARS HCoV has a 10% mortality rate, while MERS HCoV has a 36% mortality rate, according to the WHO [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. For the newly emerged coronavirus, the mortality rate is far lower (3%) than that of SARS and MERS but the fear is from its high transmission rate (human to human).",
            "HCoVs generally are positive-sense single-stranded RNA (30kb) viruses. Two groups of protein characterize HCoVs; structural, such as Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N) Matrix (M) and Envelope (E), and non-structural proteins such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (nsp12) and the Papain-like protease PLpro8. PLpro is an essential enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses, including coronaviruses. PLpro is a multifunctional cysteine protease that processes the viral polyprotein and host cell proteins by hydrolysing the peptide and isopeptide bonds in viral and cellular substrates leading to the virus replication (Baez-Santos et al 2014). PLpro is targeted in different coronaviruses viruses, including SARS, MERS, and HCV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>].",
            "In this study, the 2019-nCoV PLpro model is generated using homology modeling after sequence comparison to the solved structures in the protein data bank 19. Molecular docking is then performed to test some drugs (anti-SARS PLpro and anti-HCV NS3) against 2019-nCoV PLpro. The results suggest possible inhibition for the currently available therapeutics against the newly emerged coronavirus in silico."

Three black-dashed rectangles mark the active site residues (C112, H273, and D287) of both SARS HCoV and 2019-nCoV PLpro. Figure 1B shows the pairwise sequence alignment of 2019-nCoV PLpro versus HCV NS3 (PDB ID: 3SU6). Orange-dashed rectangles surround the active site residues of HCV NS3 (H78, D102, and S159). As implied from the alignment, SARS PLpro versus 2019-nCoV PLpro shows high conservation (highlighted in red), called sequelogous. Despite the pairwise percent identity of 2019-nCoV PLpro against SARS HCoV PLpro is 82.8%, and only 11.85% for HCV NS3, the similarity to 2019-nCoV PLpro is 93.81% and 59.68% for SARS PLpro and HCV NS3, respectively.

The three active site residues are in red (surface accessible) while the rest of the residues in green (see the enlarged panel). The surface accessibility is vital for the function of the protease, allowing the interaction with the substrates.",
            "The complete genome for 2019-nCoV has a BLAST sequence identity of 89.12 % and 82.34% with Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS coronavirus ZS-C, respectively. Drug designers should take care of the identity, especially when emerging RNA viruses that have a high mutation rate are targeted. On the other hand, potent drugs could undetectably present on shelves able to stop the rapidly emerging 2019-nCoV strain.",
            "2019-nCoV PLpro model (315 residues) is built by the aid of the Swiss Model using SARS HCoV PLpro (PDB ID: 5Y3E, chain A) as a homolog. The model is sequelogous (82.8% id) to the template suggesting a high-quality model obtained. The model is valid based on the values of the Ramachandran plot (100% in the allowed region and 92.9% in the most favored region). Besides, 92.04% of the residues have averaged a 3D-1D score of \u2264 0.2 (Verify 3D software), while the overall quality factor (ERRAT software) is 94.8%. PROVE software gives 2.7% atomic volumes outliers, which is acceptable.",
            "Before performing the docking experiments, the structures of the small molecules, the 2019-nCoV PLpro model and SARS PLpro structure (PDB ID: 5Y3Q, Chain A), are prepared. The missing Hydrogen atoms are added to the protein structure and model, while any water molecules or ligands are removed from the SASR structure. Ligand structures are retrieved from the protein data bank files to be in the optimized active form. Figure 2 shows the 2D structures of the anti-SARS PLpro (top) and anti-HCV NS3 (bottom) drugs. The anti-SARS PLpro GRL-0667, GRL-0617, and mycophenolic acids are retrieved from the PDB files 3MJ5 (GRM), 3E9S (TTT), and 1JR1 (MOA), respectively. Besides, the anti-HCV NS3 Telaprevir, Boceprevir, and Grazoprevir are retrieved from the PDB files 3SV6 (SV6), 3LOX (MCX), and 3SUD (SUE), respectively.",
            "As reflected from the docking scores, the six compounds can bind to 2019-nCoV PLpro, SARS HCoV PLpro, and HCV NS3 with good binding energy (-5.7 up to -11.0 kcal/mol). There is a reduction in the binding energies for the drugs to 2019-nCoV PLpro compared to other proteases. For GRL-0667, GRL-0617, and Mycophenolic acid, the reduction in the binding energies for 2019-nCoV PLpro is 25%, 21%, and 30%, respectively compared to SARS PLpro. While, in the case of HCV, the reduction in the 2019-nCoV PLpro binding energies is 18%, 11%, and 38% for Telaprevir, Boceprevir, and Grazoprevir, respectively. Despite this reduction, the PLpro of 2019-nCoV still able to bind the drugs with good binding energies (-5.7 up to -7 kcal/mol), which is enough to maintain the viral protein dysfunctionally.",
            "To further analyze the binding patterns, we examined the interaction complexes formed upon docking by the aid of the PLIP web server. Figures 4A and 4B show the interactions that formed after docking of the anti-SARS (GRL-0667, GRL-0617, and Mycophenolic acid) and anti-HCV drugs (Telaprevir, Boceprevir, and Grazoprevir), respectively. The solid blue lines indicate H-bonding, while dashed grey lines indicate hydrophobic interactions. The salt bridges and the \u03c0-\u03c0 contacts are represented in balls connected by yellow dashed lines, and green dashed lines, respectively. The labeled residues (blue sticks) represent the 2019-nCoV active residues that interact with the ligands (orange sticks). Tables 1 and 2 show the interaction pattern that established upon docking for the anti-SARS drugs and the anti-HCV drugs, respectively. The binding energies are listed in the table along with the number of formed H-bonds and the number of hydrophobic interactions established after docking. The amino acids from the 2019-nCoV PLpro that engaged in the interaction with the ligands are listed as well in tables 1 and 2.",
            "Additionally, the results of the interactions of SARS PLpro against anti-SARS drugs are listed in table 1, while the anti-HCV drugs\u2019 interactions with HCV NS3 are listed in table 2 for comparison. The most-reported residues from the 2019-nCoV PLpro that take part in the interaction through H-bonding or hydrophobic interactions are K105 and W106 (bold residues in tables 1 and 2). As implies from the tables, both SARS PLpro and HCV NS3 have a higher number of interactions established upon docking the tested drugs compared to the new coronavirus strain. However, there are a minimum number of established interactions (seven interactions) that stabilize the drugs in the protein active site for 2019-nCoV PLpro. Besides, in all docking experiments, the established interactions are both H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions in addition to few salt bridges (stared residues in the tables 1 and 2) suggesting the possibility of these drugs (anti-SARS and anti-HCV drugs) to bind to and inhibit the function of the crucial viral enzyme PLpro.",
            "In summary, both anti-SARS PLpro (GRL-0667, GRL-0617, and Mycophenolic acid) and anti-HCV NS3 (Telaprevir, Boceprevir, and Grazoprevir) can bind to the active site (C112, H273, and D287) of 2019-nCoV PLpro. The binding energies for 2019-nCoV PLpro are slightly less than that calculated for SARS PLpro and HCV. On the other hand, at least seven interactions are established between 2019-nCoV PLpro and each tested compound in this study (either H-bonds or hydrophobic interactions) suggesting possible targeting of 2019-nCoV PLpro using anti-SARS and anti-HCV drugs."

        "Conclusion": [
            "Wuhan's novel coronavirus has a significant health concern since the last outbreak of these types of viruses. SARS in the year 2002 to 2003 in China left more than 700 deaths and 8000 cases in hospitals. Middle East region has an entirely different infection pattern of MERS leaving again about 800 deaths and 2500 hospitalizations. The present study aimed to test and suggest possible inhibitor drugs used against SARS and HCV proteases. Both anti-SARS PLpro (GRL-0667, GRL-0617, and Mycophenolic acid) and anti-HCV NS3 (Telaprevir, Boceprevir, and Grazoprevir) can bind to the active site of 2019-nCoV PLpro and hence, may contradict viral replication."
