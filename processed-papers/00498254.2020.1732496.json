            "Three oxidated metabolites (M1-M3) and two glucuronides (M4-M5) were detected. The intrinsic clearances (CLint) values of M1 and M4 in HLM were 48.10 and 184.03 \u03bcL/min/mg, respectively. Additionally, CYP1A1, 2C8 and 2C19 were identified as main contributors with CLint values of 13.01 \u223c 49.36 \u03bcL/min/mg, while UGT1A1, 1A7, 1A8 and 1A9 were with CLint values ranging form 85.01 to 284.07 \u03bcL/min/mg. Furthermore, activity correlation analysis proved CYP2C8, UGT1A1 and 1A9 were main active hepatic isozymes. Besides, rats and monkeys were appropriate model animals. Moreover, dipyridamole and MK571 both could significantly inhibit M4 efflux. Gene silencing results also indicated MRP4 and BCRP were major contributors in HeLa1A1 cells."
