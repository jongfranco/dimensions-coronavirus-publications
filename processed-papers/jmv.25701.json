        "abstract": "To investigate the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of the recent 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak in China and beyond, a total of 32 genomes of virus strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020 were analyzed. Phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood\u2010mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed. On the basis of the likelihood\u2010mapping analysis, the increasing tree\u2010like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing genetic diversity of 2019\u2010nCoV in human hosts. We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV strains. The estimated mean evolutionary rate for 2019\u2010nCoV ranged from 1.7926 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 1.8266 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year. On the basis of our study, undertaking epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce 2019\u2010nCOV transmission in real\u2010time.",

            "In conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of likelihood \u2010mapping, transmission network, and phylogenetic analyses in providing insights into the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of 2019\u2010nCOV. Improving the linkage between patient records and genome sequence data would also allow large\u2010scale studies to be undertaken. Such research could directly influence public health in terms of prevention efforts introduced to reduce virus transmission in real\u2010time."

The TMRCA estimated by the tip\u2010dating method was relatively narrower than that determined by the constrained evolutionary rate method. We identified three phylogenetic clusters with posterior probabilities between .99 and 1.0 using Bayesian inference (Figures 4 and 5). We also identified three transmission clusters when the genetic distance between the 2019\u2010 nCoV strains was less than 0.001% substitutions/site (Figure 6). Intriguingly, only one cluster (Guangdong/20SF028/2020 and Guangdong/20SF040/2020 from Zhuhai) was identified by both phylogenetic and network\u2010based methods. This is a good example showing the differences between phylogenetic (posterior probability or bootstrap value) and network\u2010based (genetic distance) methods. However, our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution due to the limited number of 2019\u2010nCOV genome sequences presented in this study"

            "On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan on 31 December 2019, a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d\u2014an alarm it reserves for events that pose a risk to multiple countries and which requires a coordinated international response.<br/><br/>Xingguang Li, Wei Wang, Xiaofang Zhao, Junjie Zai, and Qiang Zhao contributed equally to this study.<br/><br/>J Med Virol. 2020;1\u201311.<br/><br/>wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jmv    2|    LI ET AL.<br/><br/>Previous studies have confirmed that this virus can spread from person to person after identifying clusters of cases among families, as well as transmission from patients to healthcare workers.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] As of 3 February 2020, there have been 20 438 cases of 2019\u2010nCoV confirmed in mainland China, including 2788 serious, 425 deaths, and 632 discharged, as well as 15 in Hong Kong, 8 in Macao, and 10 in Taiwan. More than 150 cases had also been confirmed in at least 18 other countries on four continents. In epidemiological studies, the basic reproductive number (R0) is defined as the possible number of infection cases generated from a single infected person at a particular time point during an outbreak and is often used to describe transmission dynamics over the course of a disease epidemic. On the basis of earlier research, the initial R0 was estimated to be 2.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.9) among the first 425 patients with 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010induced pneumonia,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] consistent with the preliminary estimate of 1.4 to 2.5 presented by the WHO during their International Health Regulations Emergency Committee meeting on the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak. It is possible that subsequent control measures, such as the strict travel restrictions in Wuhan and China as well as overseas, may change or reduce the R0 value over the course of the virus outbreak. Of note, the coronaviridae family not only includes 2019\u2010nCoV, but also severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), and the common cold viruses in immunocompetent individuals (eg, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] The SARS\u2010CoV pathogen was responsible for the 2002\u20102003 outbreak of SARS in Guangdong Province, China, which resulted in more than 8000 cases and 774 deaths in 37 countries worldwide.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] The MERS\u2010 CoV pathogen was responsible for the 2012 outbreak of MERS, which resulted in 2494 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries worldwide.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Notably, both SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV are zoonotic in origin, with prior studies revealing bats to be the animal host source,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] and masked palm civets[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] and camels[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] to be the intermediate animal hosts (between bats and humans) of the two diseases, respectively. Recent research has also reported that the 2019\u2010nCoV virus is 96% identical at the genome level to a previously detected bat coronavirus, which belongs to a SARS\u2010related coronavirus species (ie, SARS\u2010CoV).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Like SARS\u2010CoV, MERS\u2010CoV, and many other coronaviruses, 2019\u2010nCoV likely originated in bats, but it remains unclear whether an intermediary animal host was involved before the virus jumped to humans. As reported in earlier research, however, although bats could be the original host of 2019\u2010nCoV, the virus may have initially been transmitted to an intermediate animal host sold at the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, thus facilitating the emergence of 2019\u2010nCoV in humans.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]"

Of note, the strong star\u2010like signal (100% of quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle) from \u201cdataset_14\u201d at the beginning of the virus outbreak suggests that 2019\u2010nCoV initially exhibited low genetic divergence, with recent and rapid human\u2010to\u2010 human transmission. This result is consistent with the ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed polytomy topology from \u201cdataset_14\u201d (Figure 2A). The genetic divergence from \u201cdataset_32\u201d and \u201cdataset_30\u201d was higher than that for \u201cdataset_14,\u201d but still demonstrated minor temporal signals (Figure 3). Using the constrained evolutionary rate method, the mean TMRCA dates for 2019\u2010nCoV based on the four datasets ranged from 15 October to 10 November 2019, when using a lognormal prior (mean = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% BCI: 1.854 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20104 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter (Table 1). This is considered reasonable given the limited genetic divergence and strong star\u2010like signals and is also consistent with our previous study.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] Using the tip\u2010dating method, the mean TMRCA date and"

The final dataset (\u201cdataset_32\u201d) included 32 genomes of 2019\u2010nCoV from China (n = 25), Thailand (n = 2), and USA (n = 5), with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020. Of the 25 samples collected from China, 14 were from Wuhan, Hubei Province, 6 were from Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, 2 were from Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, 2 were from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and 1 was from Taiwan (Table S1). The sampling dates of BetaCoV/Shenzhen/HKU\u2010SZ\u2010005/2020 and BetaCoV/Shenzhen/HKU\u2010SZ\u2010002/2020 were known to the nearest month (January 2020). For this dataset, the 2019\u2010nCoV genomes were aligned using MAFFT v7.22221 and then manually curated using BioEdit v7.2.5.22 In addition, we subsampled three other datasets, that is, \u201cdataset_14\u201d collected between 24 December 2019 and 1 January 2020, comprising 14 genomes from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China; \u201cdataset_24\u201d collected between 24 December 2019 and 18 January 2020, comprising 24 genomes from China and Thailand; and \u201cdataset_30\u201d collected between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020, comprising 30 genomes from China, Thailand, and USA.",
            "To assess the recombination for the full dataset (ie, \u201cdataset_32\u201d), we employed the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test to measure the similarity between closely linked sites using SplitsTree v4.15.1.23 The best\u2010fit nucleotide substitution model for \u201cdataset_32\u201d was identified according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC), small\u2010sample corrected AIC (AICc), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and performance\u2010based decision theory (DT) method with 3 (24 candidate models) or 11 (88 candidate models) substitution schemes in jModelTest v2.1.10.24 To evaluate the phylogenetic signals of the datasets, we performed likelihood\u2010mapping analysis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] using TREE\u2010 PUZZLE v5.3,26 with 35 000 to 80 000 randomly chosen quartets for the four datasets. Maximum\u2010likelihood (ML) phylogenies were reconstructed using the Hasegawa\u2010Kishino\u2010Yano (HKY) nucleotide substitution model in PhyML v3.1.27 Bootstrap support values were calculated with 1000 replicates and trees were midpoint rooted.

For each dataset, we employed HKY, as well as a constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock model to estimate the time to a most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). We then used two schemes to set the time scale prior for each dataset, that is, constrained evolutionary rate method with a lognormal prior (mean = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 1.854 \u00d7 10\u22124\u2010 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter based on previous studies[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] and the tip\u2010dating method, for which the evolutionary rate for each dataset was also estimated. To ensure adequate mixing of model parameters, MCMC chains were run for 100 million steps with sampling every 10 000 steps from the posterior distribution. Convergence was evaluated by calculating the effective sample sizes of the parameters using Tracer v1.7.1.34 All parameters had an effective sample size of more than 200, indicative of sufficient sampling. Trees were summarized as maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees using TreeAnnotator v1.8.4 after discarding the first 10% as burn\u2010in and then visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).",
            "The HIV TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (www.hivtrace.org)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] was employed to infer transmission network clusters for the full dataset (ie, \u201cdataset_32\u201d). All pairwise distances were calculated and a putative linkage between each pair of genomes was considered whenever their divergence was less than equal to 0.0001 (0.01%) or less than equal to 0.00001 (0.001%) substitutions/site (TN93 substitution model). Multiple linkages were then combined into putative transmission clusters. Clusters comprised of only two linked nodes were identified as dyads. This approach detects transmission clusters in which the clustering strains are genetically similar, implying a direct or indirect epidemiological connection."

The PHI test of \u201cdataset_32\u201d did not find statistically significant evidence for recombination (P = 1.0). Likelihood\u2010mapping analysis of \u201cdataset_14\u201d revealed that 100% of the quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating a strong star\u2010like topology signal reflecting a novel virus, which may be due to exponential epidemic spread (Figure 1A). Likewise, 91.9%, 81.8%, and 74.7% of the quartets from \u201cdataset_24,\u201d \u201cdataset_30,\u201d and \u201cdataset_32,\u201d respectively, were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating relatively more phylogenetic signals as additional sequences were analyzed over time (Figure 1B\u2010D). ML phylogenetic analysis of the four datasets also showed star\u2010like topologies, in accordance with the likelihood\u2010mapping results (Figure 2). Root\u2010to\u2010tip regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the best\u2010fitting root showed that \u201cdataset_14\u201d had a relatively strong positive temporal signal (R2 = .2967; correlation coefficient = .5446) (Figure 3A). In contrast, \u201cdataset_24\u201d had a minor negative temporal signal (R2 = 4.4428 \u00d7 10\u22122; correlation coefficient = \u2212.2108) (Figure 3B); whereas, \u201cdataset_30\u201d and \u201cdataset_32\u201d both had minor positive temporal signals (R2 = 1.2155 \u00d7 10\u22122; correlation coefficient = .1102 and R2 = 1.1506 \u00d7 10\u22122; correlation coefficient = .1073) (Figure 3C,D).

We also considered individuals as genetically linked when the genetic distance between 2019\u2010nCoV strains was less than 0.001% substitutions/site. This allowed us to identify three transmission clusters that included 15 of 32 (46.875%) genomes for \u201cdataset_32\u201d (Figure 6B). Clusters ranged in size from two to nine genomes. Two clusters, which contained two (Guangdong/20SF028/2020 and Guangdong/20SF040/2020) and four genomes (Guangdong/20SF012/2020, Guangdong/20SF013/ 2020, Guangdong/20SF025/2020, and Shenzhen/HKU\u2010SZ\u2010 002/2020), respectively, included individuals sampled exclusively from Zhuhai and Shenzhen, respectively. The largest cluster of nine genomes included five sampled from Wuhan (Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101/2019, Wuhan/IVDC\u2010HB\u201001/2019, Wuhan/WIV04/2019, Wuhan/WIV06/ 2019, and Wuhan/IPBCAMS\u2010WH\u201004/2019), one sampled from Hangzhou (Zhejiang/WZ\u201002/2020), two sampled from Thailand (Nonthaburi/61/2020 and Nonthaburi/74/2020), and one sampled from USA (USA/IL1/2020).",
            "We considered individuals as genetically linked when the genetic distance between 2019\u2010nCoV strains was less than 0.01% substitutions/site. This allowed us to identify a single large transmission cluster that included 30 of 32 (93.75%) genomes, thus suggesting low"

        "4 | DISCUSSION": [
            "On the basis of \u201cdataset_32,\u201d which included 32 genomes of 2019\u2010 nCoV strains sampled from China (Wuhan, n = 14; Shenzhen, n = 6;",
            "Zhuhai, n = 2; Hangzhou, n = 2; Taiwan, n = 1), Thailand (n = 2), and USA (n = 5) with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020, and subsampled \u201cdataset_14,\u201d \u201cdataset_24,\u201d and \u201cdataset_30,\u201d which included 14, 24, and 30 2019\u2010nCoV strain genomes, respectively, our likelihood\u2010mapping analysis confirmed additional tree\u2010like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time, thus indicating increasing genetic divergence of 2019\u2010nCoV in human hosts (Figure 1). Of note, the strong star\u2010like signal (100% of quartets were distributed in the center of the triangle) from \u201cdataset_14\u201d at the beginning of the virus outbreak suggests that 2019\u2010nCoV initially exhibited low genetic divergence, with recent and rapid human\u2010to\u2010 human transmission. This result is consistent with the ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed polytomy topology from \u201cdataset_14\u201d (Figure 2A). The genetic divergence from \u201cdataset_32\u201d and \u201cdataset_30\u201d was higher than that for \u201cdataset_14,\u201d but still demonstrated minor temporal signals (Figure 3). Using the constrained evolutionary rate method, the mean TMRCA dates for 2019\u2010nCoV based on the four datasets ranged from 15 October to 10 November 2019, when using a lognormal prior (mean = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year; 95% BCI: 1.854 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20104 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year) placed on the evolutionary rate parameter (Table 1). This is considered reasonable given the limited genetic divergence and strong star\u2010like signals and is also consistent with our previous study.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] Using the tip\u2010dating method, the mean TMRCA date and",
            "The first genome sequence of 2019\u2010nCoV was made public in early January 2020, with several dozen\u2014taken from various people\u2014 now available. The genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV have already led to diagnostic tests, as well as efforts to study its dispersal and evolution. As the outbreak continues, we will require multiple genome sequences of samples over the course of the outbreak and from different locations to determine how the virus evolves. We also need to gain a better understanding of the virus's biology, especially compared to findings from previous studies on the SARS and MERS viruses. For instance, 2019\u2010nCoV can kill cultured human cells, entering them via the same molecular receptor as SARS\u2010CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Therefore, it is essential that we isolate, share, and study virus samples, both in China and elsewhere, to identify animals that exhibit similar infection to humans for drug and vaccine testing, to better understand virus transmission (eg, airborne or close contact), and to develop blood tests for viral antibodies. Currently, 2019\u2010nCoV has primarily caused severe illness and death in older people, particularly those with pre\u2010existing conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Although this virus does not typically infect or kill young and healthy individuals, a 36\u2010year\u2010old Wuhan man with no known pre\u2010existing health conditions has been the youngest victim reported so far. In situations where a virus jumps from one animal host to another species\u2014which is probably how this coronavirus initially infected humans\u2014most mutations are detrimental to or have no effect on the virus, and selection pressure may improve survival in the new host. Therefore, we predict that one or more mutations may be selected and sustained during the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak as the virus adapts to human hosts and possibly reduces its virulence, as reported in the previous study.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] However, we are uncertain whether this will influence its transmissibility.",
            "In conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of likelihood \u2010mapping, transmission network, and phylogenetic analyses in providing insights into the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of 2019\u2010nCOV. Improving the linkage between patient records and genome sequence data would also allow large\u2010scale studies to be undertaken. Such research could directly influence public health in terms of prevention efforts introduced to reduce virus transmission in real\u2010time."
