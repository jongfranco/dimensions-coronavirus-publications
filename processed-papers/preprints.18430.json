        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\n                        When a new disease starts to spread, one of the commonly asked questions is (1) how deadly it is. World Health Organization (WHO) announced in a press conference on January 29th, 2020 and reported the death rate of COVID-19 was 2% on the case fatality rate(CFR). Whether the claim was underestimated is worthy of clarifications when considering the lag days from symptom onset to death.\n                \n                                \n                    OBJECTIVE\n                        We developed an app for online displaying three types of computations of CFR and verifying the death rate of 2% substantially underestimated.\n                \n                                \n                    METHODS\n                        We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak numbers from January 21 to February 25, 2020, in countries/regions on a daily basis from Github that contains daily information on confirmed cases, deaths, and the recovered in more than 30 Chinese locations and other worldwide countries/regions. Three CFRs on COVID-19 were compared, including (A) deaths/confirmed;(B) deaths/(deaths+recovered); and (C) deaths/(cases x days ago). The coefficients of variance (CV=the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) were applied to measure the relative variability for each CFR. A dashboard was developed for daily display of the CFR on COVID-19 for each region.\n                \n                                \n                    RESULTS\n                        We observed that the CVs were 0.07, 9.23, and 5.08 and the CFRs were 3.37%, 8.85%, and 3.58% for these three CFR computations, respectively, on Feb. 25, 2020. The death rate of COVID-19(=2%) announced by WHO using the formula of deaths/confirmed was substantially underestimated. A dashboard was created to present the provisional CFRs of COVID-19 on a daily basis.\n                \n                                \n                    CONCLUSIONS\n                        We suggest examining these three CFRs as a reference to the final CFR. An app developed for displaying the provisional CFR with these three CFRs can modify the underestimated CFR reported by WHO and media.\n                \n                                \n                    CLINICALTRIAL\n                        Not available",
