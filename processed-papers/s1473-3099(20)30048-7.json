            "An important determinant of whether or not 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will ultimately cause a global pandemic is its ability to become established upon its importation to a new country. Cases of 2019-nCoV infection have so far been reported in 24 countries, yet little human-to-human transmission outside of China has occurred.",
            "The key quantity governing whether or not 2019-nCoV can establish and generate a sustained outbreak on arrival in a new country is the reproduction number, R, which represents the average number of individuals that each infector will transmit the virus to. If R is greater than 1, sustained transmission can occur; if R is less than 1, then chains of transmission will simply stutter out."

            "I read with interest the excellent Review on sepsis immunopathology by Ignacio Rubio and colleagues,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] which covered in detail the known (and more crucially, the unknown) developments in sepsis-related research. However, one very relevant nuance was perhaps overlooked.",
            "Despite immunosuppression being a substantial risk factor for sepsis, as the authors note, a reasonable amount of evidence points to immuno\u00ad suppression being protective in a given sepsis episode. For example, in a large, retrospective hospital dataset, Donnelly and colleagues[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] showed that in-hospital mortality for severe sepsis in patients with solid organ transplant was nearly half that of patients without (5\u00b75% vs 9\u00b74%). This protective effect remained (albeit weakened) after adjusting for relevant confounders\u2014with an odds ratio of 0\u00b783 (95% CI 0\u00b779\u20130\u00b787) for inhospital mortality.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] In a smaller study by Kalil and colleagues,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a> 123] solid organ transplant recipients with blood culture-proven sepsis were age and sex matched with 246 controls. Despite having more comorbidities and higher scores on the quick sepsisrelated organ failure assessment, solid organ transplant recipients had lower 28-day mortality, with a hazard ratio of 0\u00b722 (95% CI 0\u00b709\u20130\u00b754).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Finally, in a large Danish cohort study,4 3092 renal transplant recipients were matched with population controls, and despite having approxi\u00admately ten times the incidence of pneumonia, the mortality rate in each episode was approximately half that of the general population (7% vs 14%).",
            "Clearly, other reasons for patients with solid organ transplant having greater survival than those without are plausible (ie, enhanced care, care in a tertiary centre, or earlier presentation), but this intriguing finding deserves explanation and should be explored further in translational and clinical studies. This balance between resis\u00ad tance to infection and tolerance of it might be the key to understanding the molecular mechanisms of sepsis.",

            "We thank Fergus Hamilton for raising a relevant caveat in sepsis immunology\u2014 ie, the potentially protective effect of immunosuppression in particular settings of sepsis. Hamilton high\u00ad lights the case of solid organ transp\u00adlant recipients, an immunesuppressed collective for whom some observational studies report lower mortality from sepsis. These findings imply that solid organ transplantassociated immunosuppression could conceivably buffer or prevent the deleterious (especially the early) effect of hyperinflammation in sepsis. In agreement with this notion, transplantation-related neutropenia has been suggested to have a protective role in septic shock.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]",
            "Although we sympathise with this concept, we believe that studies in solid organ transplant recipients must be interpreted with caution given the interference of numerous confounders beyond those mentioned by Hamilton. First, patients with solid organ transplant tend to be younger than the average patient with sepsis, implying that immune senescence will differentially impinge on both cohorts.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] Second, the occurrence of immunosuppression in patients with sepsis who did not receive a solid organ transplant (ie, because of cancer therapy or prolonged treatment with steroids in chronic respiratory diseases).
