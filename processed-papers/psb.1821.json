Alternative strategies such as repurposing existing antivirals, or neutralising the virus by developing antibodies that block cell entry, also need exploring. However, with thorough human testing of all these strategies likely to take considerable time, and vaccine trials only expected to be completed by the end of the year, there is an anxious wait ahead."
