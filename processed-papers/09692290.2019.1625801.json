        "abstract": "In this article, we seek to intervene on the global health security debate and attendant literatures to argue that the primary focus of global health security \u2013 that infectious disease is an existential security threat to both humans and vital infrastructures \u2013 only tells one part of the story about the meaning and significance of biological danger in the contemporary context. While important, this perspective fails to grapple with the ways that our conception of what biology is and what it can do have been altered through advances in science and technology, particularly through the intermingling of computer science and molecular biology. Starting from the premise that biology has been informationalized, we argue that biological exchange is not only a threat to humans and the institutional structures they create, it is also, importantly, a political and economic opportunity for firms and core states involved in global health security, and one of the key bases for an emergent global political economy of health security. We forward the idea of a somatic-security industrial complex to capture this dynamic.",

        "conclusion": [
            "To conclude, the political economy we outline here has already been signalled through the theorization of novel state-market relations built around molecules (see Elbe and Long in this issue); in new forms of capital built around biology and pharmaceuticals (Sunder Rajan, 2006); new forms of global health financing (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSands_2017_a\" href=\"#rSands_2017_a\">Sands & Chawla, 2017</a>); and in wider research on the emerging bioeconomy (Cooper, 2008; Dietz, Bo\u20acrner, Fo\u20acrster, & von Braun, 2018). Nevertheless, these works do not explicitly address the way that the informationalization of life itself plays a central role in all of these phenomena and in contributing to the emergence of what we refer to as the somatic security industrial complex. This complex relies on the latent labor of informationalized life and seeks to harness its (re)productive potential through biological exchange. If, as Nikolas Rose has written, the politics of life itself involves a somatic ethics which \u2018accords a particular moral virtue to the search for profit through the management of life\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRose_2007_a\" href=\"#rRose_2007_a\">Rose, 2007</a>, p. 8) then somatic security accords a certain level of assurance that the varied species of biocapital and associated forms of embodied labor and biological exchanges that are central to making biological life live will be protected and promoted through a growing complex of political and economic forces."

            "The global health security policy community and attendant and often critical health security literature have both failed to grapple with the ways that our conception of what biology is and what it can do have been altered through advances in science and technology, particularly through the intermingling of computer science and molecular biology (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThacker_2004_a\" href=\"#rThacker_2004_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThacker_2004_a\" href=\"#rThacker_2004_a\">Thacker, 2004</a></a>). These changes have led to a new technological frame (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBijker_1989_a\" href=\"#rBijker_1989_a\">Bijker 1989</a>) in which we can now think about bodies and biology in digital and analog form or, through the idea of biomedia, a combination of the two (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThacker_2004_a\" href=\"#rThacker_2004_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThacker_2004_a\" href=\"#rThacker_2004_a\">Thacker, 2004</a></a>). These new forms of understanding, technologies and linkages are clearly intersecting with health security, albeit with a surprising lack of critical analysis to date. Genomic bodies, molecular bodies, digital bodies, informational bodies and a host of other biomediated bodies must therefore be added to the long-standing idea of molar or whole bodies and populations that global health security focuses on. Re-thinking bodies in this way provides a different perspective on both the perils and the promises of biological exchange, and on the stakes in global health security.",
            "Starting from the premise that biology has been informationalized, we wish to forward an alternative and critical perspective on health security. Our argument is that biological exchange is not only a threat to humans and the institutional structures they create, it is also, importantly, a political and economic opportunity for firms and core states involved in global health security, and the basis for an emergent global political economy (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\">Braun, 2007</a></a>; Cooper, 2008; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHelmreich_2008_a\" href=\"#rHelmreich_2008_a\">Helmreich, 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHester_2015_a\" href=\"#rHester_2015_a\">Hester, 2015</a>). Akin to Naomi Klein\u2019s argument on disaster capitalism, in which profit is to be made and power is to be gained from the misfortunes of others, we argue that global bioinsecurities present a political economic opportunity, especially for Western states and institutions, to protect and grow their bio-economies and thus to bolster both their geopolitical power and national economic interests (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKlein_2007_a\" href=\"#rKlein_2007_a\">Klein, 2007</a>). Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, this is achieved through the promotion, rather than prevention, of biological exchange, and through further global integration of nations in virtual space rather than through physical territorial separation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\">Braun, 2007</a></a>). We therefore see a tension and point of exploitation for capital that les between the attempt to control harmful and threatening biological exchange while at the same profiting and commodifying new forms of biological exchange that health security concerns play a large part in driving.",
            "In its informationalized form biology and biological exchange is part and parcel of all manner of contemporary global health research and programming networks that rely on collecting, compiling, storing, disseminating, utilizing and exchanging biological data from randomized control trials and viral synthesis to medical diagnostics and disease detection (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\">Braun, 2007</a>; Thacker, 2006). More than a technology (in)forming these efforts, however, biological data and genetic information are",
            "R. J. HESTER AND O. D. WILLIAMS commodities that can be networked, exchanged, produced and proliferated both in material form, as biological matter such as virus samples and cell lines, and in virtual form as a series of one\u2019s and zero\u2019s to be studied in silico. In addition, DNA is increasingly seen as an information storage database in its own right (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMolteni_2018_a\" href=\"#rMolteni_2018_a\">Molteni, 2018</a>). The logic of research and the value embedded in biological information have both changed.",
            "Just as our ideas of what biology is and what it can do have changed so too have the kinds of labor, the forms of value, the kinds of capital, the temporalities and the modes of production that correspond to those bodies (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCooper_2014_a\" href=\"#rCooper_2014_a\">Cooper & Waldby, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPeters_2012_a\" href=\"#rPeters_2012_a\">Peters, 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRajan_2006_a\" href=\"#rRajan_2006_a\">Rajan, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThacker_2004_a\" href=\"#rThacker_2004_a\">Thacker, 2004</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThompson_2005_a\" href=\"#rThompson_2005_a\">Thompson, 2005</a>). Informationalized biology has also engendered a novel political economy of global health security, as this article seeks to explore. This informationalized understanding of life and the political economy that has emerged with it have not yet been captured in the global health security literature. To the extent that this literature continues to forward the foundational thesis of biological vulnerability, it obscures the identification and analysis of the ways that biological exchanges are imperative to health security. Indeed, when the exchange of informationalized biology is prevented or forestalled, it has the potential to negatively impact both global health security and the burgeoning bioeconomy. Global biological exchange not only facilitates the mitigation of disease, but also contributes to the development of novel products, services, regulations, institutional arrangements and forms of capital. To capture the political economy that is sedimenting around networked forms of informationalized biology, we introduce the idea of a somatic-security industrial complex (SSIC). With an eye toward the scalar relationship between corporeal and corporate bodies, as well as molecular and molar (or whole human) bodies, our use of the term somatic signals the fact that it is biological bodies, in myriad forms, that are both the source of value and labor in the SSIC and the essential motivation for security. We ground our discussion in the biological exchanges taking place in the research and circulation of influenza virus, the only known pathogen to cause a pandemic, and thus a core concern of global health security (WHO Fact Sheet).",
            "To take this forward we provide a brief review of the global health security literature showing how the global health security agenda (GHSA) largely focuses on the idea that infectious disease is an existential threat to western nations and how this perception engenders a narrow, western and statist response bent on defending against the dangers of biological exchange. This leads us to our second section, whereby we discuss the ways that informationalized understandings of bodies and biology have provided new opportunities for the promotion and proliferation of biological exchange. Rather than focus on bodies swept up in the unpredictable \u2018biological cauldron\u2019 of the twenty-first century, we focus on the ways that they are promoted, modulated, and managed in the name of global health security (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\">Braun, 2007</a>). Through this discussion, we point to the ways that health, security and capitalism are changing, both separately and together, and how this leads to the emergence of a SSIC. We conclude by pointing toward the ways that a failure to ensure global biological circulation can impact geopolitical dynamics, jeopardizing the GHSA while weakening the continued hegemony of Western states in the bioeconomy.",
            "The relationship between global health and national security has been rather loosely termed \u2018health security\u2019 or \u2018global public health security\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAldis_2008_a\" href=\"#rAldis_2008_a\">Aldis, 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFeldbaum_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rFeldbaum_et+al_2006_a\">Feldbaum, Patel, Sondorp, & Lee, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHoffman_2010_a\" href=\"#rHoffman_2010_a\">Hoffman, 2010</a>). These catch-all terms necessarily simplify and provide a shorthand for numerous contested understandings and constructions of security as a health issue and for certain existential threats to health that are constructed as demanding health security responses, governance and policy (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcinnes_2004_a\" href=\"#rMcinnes_2004_a\">McInnes, 2004</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPrice-Smith_2001_a\" href=\"#rPrice-Smith_2001_a\">Price-Smith, 2001</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRushton_2011_a\" href=\"#rRushton_2011_a\">Rushton, 2011</a>). The common impetus for these security constructions is a fear of the uncertainties associated with the global circulation and exchange of biological life (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\">Braun, 2007</a></a>). These cartographies of vulnerability operate at multiple scales from the molecular to the molar (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAhuja_2016_a\" href=\"#rAhuja_2016_a\">Ahuja, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\">Braun, 2007</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_2014_a\" href=\"#rChen_2014_a\">Chen 2014</a>). Underlying fears of biological exchange is the premise that living systems are all inherently and increasingly vulnerable to a biological event of significance (Elbe, Roemer-Mahler, & Long, 2014; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGarrett_1994_a\" href=\"#rGarrett_1994_a\">Garrett, 1994</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKing_2002_a\" href=\"#rKing_2002_a\">King, 2002</a>; WHO, 1994).",
            "In response to such vulnerability, the GHSA was instantiated in 2014 at the urging of the United States (US). Operating both from the assumption of inevitable and large scale biological danger and the inherent vulnerability of the human species, the GHSA has tasked itself with detecting and intervening upon any menacing biological matters that threaten the health of human lives. At the heart of this global agenda lies the now commonplace idea that an infectious disease outbreak of pandemic proportions is not only just around the corner, it is only a plane ride away. Such a perspective is captured in the oft-repeated phrase that, \u2018it\u2019s not a matter of if, but when\u2019 the next biological catastrophe will occur (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSpeakman_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rSpeakman_et+al_2017_a\">Speakman, McKee, & Coker, 2017</a>). The GHSA therefore reflects the ambitions of other multilateral and multisectoral initiatives, such as the International Health Regulations (IHR), targeted at preventing, detecting and eradicating pandemic and biological threats by keeping them contained at their sources (WHO, 2008).",
            "These ambitions and initiatives have been closely scrutinized by global health security scholars. For example, the securitization of particular areas of global health has engendered a debate about whether and how health and security should be thought about and brought together, and the consequences for health and health actors of playing the security card (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavies_2008_a\" href=\"#rDavies_2008_a\">Davies, 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_2006_a\" href=\"#rElbe_2006_a\">Elbe, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRushton_2011_a\" href=\"#rRushton_2011_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRushton_2011_a\" href=\"#rRushton_2011_a\">Rushton, 2011</a></a>). Attention has also been given to the impact of securitization on human health, health policy and health priorities, and questions have been raised as to whether securitizing health is healthy for health (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRushton_2011_a\" href=\"#rRushton_2011_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRushton_2011_a\" href=\"#rRushton_2011_a\">Rushton, 2011</a></a>). While much of the field has debated the value of securitizing infectious disease or even medicalizing insecurity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_2010_a\" href=\"#rElbe_2010_a\">Elbe, 2010</a>), at least one scholar has argued that the securitization of health in recent decades is not a novel phenomenon, and thus global health security scholars should stop treating it as if it were (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHowell_2014_a\" href=\"#rHowell_2014_a\">Howell, 2014</a>). Because global health security works from the premise that humans and the systems they create are inherently vulnerable, the securitization literature performatively reaffirms this premise even as it makes the security response to health appear novel (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCaduff_2014_a\" href=\"#rCaduff_2014_a\">Caduff, 2014</a>).",
            "Whether novel or not, global health security has been successively sedimented into what has been characterized as a \u2018worldview\u2019 that is largely bound up with worries about emerging (and re-emerging) infectious disease alongside concerns with man-made biological threats and bioterrorism (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKing_2002_a\" href=\"#rKing_2002_a\">King, 2002</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSastry_2012_a\" href=\"#rSastry_2012_a\">Sastry & Dutta, 2012</a>). Based on a particular form of somatic expertise and technology (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRose_2007_a\" href=\"#rRose_2007_a\">Rose, 2007</a>), as well as a materiality and order that is legitimized by an ever-growing list of biological dangers, global health security has concerned itself with a broad set of issues in response. Formerly focused primarily on national security and international security orders, health security rationales and discourses have shifted to non-state actors, as well as \u2018non-traditional security\u2019 threats that include any accidentally, intentionally or naturally occurring biological catastrophe (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHameiri_2013_a\" href=\"#rHameiri_2013_a\">Hameiri & Jones, 2013</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcinnes_2006_a\" href=\"#rMcinnes_2006_a\">McInnes & Lee, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPrice-Smith_2001_a\" href=\"#rPrice-Smith_2001_a\">Price-Smith, 2001</a>).",
            "The global health security worldview is very much linked to juggernaut globalization processes and the manner in which urbanization, trade links, migrant communities, mass rapid transit, and climate change all act as vectors and multipliers for infectious diseases (Dowell & Levitt, 2002; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFidler_2004_a\" href=\"#rFidler_2004_a\">Fidler, 2004</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGarrett_1994_a\" href=\"#rGarrett_1994_a\">Garrett, 1994</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcinnes_2006_a\" href=\"#rMcinnes_2006_a\">McInnes & Lee, 2006</a>). Given these, it has been widely noted that, at least since the beginning of the 1990s, health security as a set of political discourses and practices has evolved alongside and been driven by a recognition of the impact of transborder processes, and global exchange involving circuits of trade, people and capital, on our collective vulnerability (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBrown_2011_a\" href=\"#rBrown_2011_a\">Brown, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDodgson_et+al_2002_a\" href=\"#rDodgson_et+al_2002_a\">Dodgson, Lee, & Drager, 2002</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFidler_2007_a\" href=\"#rFidler_2007_a\">Fidler, 2007</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFidler_2006_a\" href=\"#rFidler_2006_a\">Fidler & Gostin, 2006</a>). In what follows, we outline the predominant features of global health security as they have been discussed in the literature.",
            "The health security agenda is extremely conservative in global public health terms, narrowed down to all but a few health issues largely associated with bioterrorism and emerging and re-emerging infectious disease (ERIDs). Much of the concern with infectious disease and the circulation of pathogens has historically been bound to the nation-state and colonial powers and with public health systems and vector control approaches. However, globalization drivers \u2013 such as mass rapid transit, migrant population and trade, increasingly created a sense of the new scale of biological danger posed by infectious disease threat, and saw the framing of the required responses as something beyond the territoriality and power of any given state (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFidler_2003_a\" href=\"#rFidler_2003_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFidler_2003_a\" href=\"#rFidler_2003_a\">Fidler, 2003</a></a>; Kickbusch & de Leeuw, 1999). Norm entrepreneurs, public academics and think tanks were all key to the shaping of the GHSA, with figures such as Stephen Morse, Laurie Garrett and David Fidler framing the response to the new scale of threat as a \u2018Post-Westphalian\u2019 endeavour of collective action to head off biological catastrophe (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFidler_2003_a\" href=\"#rFidler_2003_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFidler_2003_a\" href=\"#rFidler_2003_a\">Fidler, 2003</a></a>, 2007; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGarrett_1994_a\" href=\"#rGarrett_1994_a\">Garrett, 1994</a>; Kickbusch & de Leeuw, 1999).",
            "Much of this transnational effort, however, was especially imagined with the state as the key referent object of action and policy, with national security constantly used to frame the rationale for collective action. In times of potential pandemic events this appears attractive to many. As Caballero-Anthony writes following SARS in 2003, \u2018[G]iven the multidimensional threats to national security posed by infectious diseases such as SARS, it is imperative that states treat these diseases within a security framework (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCaballero-Anthony_2005_a\" href=\"#rCaballero-Anthony_2005_a\">Caballero-Anthony, 2005</a>). McInnes and Lee and other critical voices have noted that health security progressively reflected national security concerns and drivers, and that global health security has therefore rarely been about the mobilization of cosmopolitan foreign policy for the purposes of international public health (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavies_2008_a\" href=\"#rDavies_2008_a\">Davies, 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFeldbaum_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rFeldbaum_et+al_2006_a\">Feldbaum et al, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcinnes_2006_a\" href=\"#rMcinnes_2006_a\">McInnes & Lee, 2006</a>).",
            "Rather, from its early genesis in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the GHSA was deliberately constructed as narrow (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKing_2002_a\" href=\"#rKing_2002_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKing_2002_a\" href=\"#rKing_2002_a\">King, 2002</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWeir_2014_a\" href=\"#rWeir_2014_a\">Weir, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWeir_2010_a\" href=\"#rWeir_2010_a\">Weir & Mykhalovskiy, 2010</a>), with an underlying concern with what biological threats implied for states, the global economy, and international order (Elbe et al, 2014). As such, the focus has been on infectious disease (ERIDS), biosafety and bioterrorism (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAldis_2008_a\" href=\"#rAldis_2008_a\">Aldis, 2008</a>; Fidler & Gostin, 2008; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcinnes_2006_a\" href=\"#rMcinnes_2006_a\">McInnes & Lee, 2006</a>). However, it is generally ERIDS that have become the prime focus of health security literature and of international policy and state investment. In 2007, Fidler traces the increasing introduction of security concepts and discourses into policy and academic focus on infectious disease threats. Indeed, very few of the infectious diseases that cause mortality have remained immune from a global health security perspective. Most notably HIV/AIDS has inspired a series of reports and scholarly attention as to whether it is linked to failed states, has been securitized or partially securitized, or as to the consequences of security actors inveighing on an issue of international public health (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChretien_2011_a\" href=\"#rChretien_2011_a\">Chretien, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLakoff_2008_a\" href=\"#rLakoff_2008_a\">Lakoff & Collier, 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPrins_2004_a\" href=\"#rPrins_2004_a\">Prins, 2004</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRushton_2011_a\" href=\"#rRushton_2011_a\">Rushton, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSelgelid_2016_a\" href=\"#rSelgelid_2016_a\">Selgelid, 2016</a>).

Most recently, the Ebola outbreaks in Western Africa have been unpicked by health security scholars, pointing to the enmeshment of military response with a potential pandemic, and high level focus on the infection as a security threat of global import that would also undermine normal circulatory systems in the global economy (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHeymann_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rHeymann_et+al_2015_a\">Heymann et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKalra_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rKalra_et+al_2014_a\">Kalra et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcinnes_2016_a\" href=\"#rMcinnes_2016_a\">McInnes, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNunes_2016_a\" href=\"#rNunes_2016_a\">Nunes, 2016</a>).",
            "On top of this, biosecurity, bioterrorism and biological weapons have continued to be areas of security concern, with at least one major 1972 convention, the Biological Toxins Weapons Convention (BTWC), predating the rise of global health security. Again, biosafety and bioterrorism concerns have intensified under globalization, particularly with the diffusion of the basic science necessary for the deliberate or unintentional release of harmful biological agents, with molecular biology, biotechnology and other life science techniques enabling production in fragile or rogue states and by terrorist organizations (Cooper, 2008; Fidler & Gostin, 2008). The anthrax events in the US in 2001 also sharpened efforts toward better surveillance, preparedness and medical countermeasures, at least as being developed in Western countries, and particularly the US (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChretien_2011_a\" href=\"#rChretien_2011_a\">Chretien, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_2011_a\" href=\"#rElbe_2011_a\">Elbe, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rElbe_et+al_2015_a\">Elbe, Roemer-Mahler, & Long, 2015</a>; Fidler & Gostin, 2008).",
            "The narrow and select health security agenda has received a great deal of criticism, if tempered by a recognition of the real need for international action to counteract very real pandemic threats. However, it is clear that the GHSA is far from the emancipatory security envisioned by Booth (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBooth_1991_a\" href=\"#rBooth_1991_a\">Booth, 1991</a>), or the health and human security approach advocated in the 2003 Commission on Human Security (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOgata_2003_a\" href=\"#rOgata_2003_a\">Ogata & Sen, 2003</a>). Despite the welcome and inevitable focus on infectious disease affecting low income regions of the world \u2013 especially sub-Saharan Africa and HIV/AIDS \u2013 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_2006_a\" href=\"#rElbe_2006_a\">Elbe, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcinnes_2013_a\" href=\"#rMcinnes_2013_a\">McInnes & Rushton, 2013</a>) \u2013 there has been almost no commensurate investment and resources regarding health systems capacities to deal with any pandemic threats, or even routine outbreaks of infectious disease. Thus for many, the emphasis of Western GHSA has been on surveillance and containment in resource poor countries, rather than in building badly needed capacities to deal with very real threats (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFauci_2014_a\" href=\"#rFauci_2014_a\">Fauci, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHeymann_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rHeymann_et+al_2015_a\">Heymann et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKalra_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rKalra_et+al_2014_a\">Kalra et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOoms_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rOoms_et+al_2017_a\">Ooms et al, 2017</a>). In contrast, the US and other Western states have devoted substantial resources toward protecting their own citizens and borders from pandemic threats, via global disease surveillance, stockpiles of medical countermeasures, and investments in medical and virological research (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBell_2012_a\" href=\"#rBell_2012_a\">Bell & Figert, 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_2011_a\" href=\"#rElbe_2011_a\">Elbe, 2011</a>; Elbe et al, 2014). For Lee and McInnes, the problem of health security is broader still for global health, as it has skewed focus away from international public health and health systems (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcinnes_2006_a\" href=\"#rMcinnes_2006_a\">McInnes & Lee, 2006</a>), despite some welcome gains in investment in select infectious disease such as HIV.",
            "The consequent holes left in international public health and national health systems are routinely exposed. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2014/2015 illustrated how countries with poor health system and little or no capacities in terms of reference laboratories, isolation and sterilization and so on, were largely incapable of conducting a public health response to an infectious disease outbreak, thereby threatening international public health (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOoms_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rOoms_et+al_2017_a\">Ooms et al, 2017</a>; WHO Ebola Response Team, 2016). It was some 3 months after the initial outbreak that the virus was identified as Ebola (and not cholera, as initially suspected) and the international response was slow to factor in that the health systems of these countries needed to be supplanted by an emergency intervention (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKalra_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rKalra_et+al_2014_a\">Kalra et al, 2014</a>). By the time the pandemic was over some 11,000 had died. In this context it is worth noting that the WHO estimates that some 1 billion people globally lack any access to health workers at all, meaning that there are huge gaps in capacity to serve health security threats let alone basic health needs.",
            "There has also been a further skewing of global health and public health away from other priorities in health, such as other diseases which represent a huge proportion of the global burden of disease, with non-communicable diseases overtaking infections as the leading source of mortality \u2013 often referred to as a global epidemiological transition. With greater political focus on infectious diseases and pandemics, health systems are not serving people\u2019s\u2019 interests and needs in these areas (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBond_2008_a\" href=\"#rBond_2008_a\">Bond, 2008</a>). Whereas tobacco, fast food and alcohol kill millions each year and we face epidemics of obesity, diabetes and respiratory disorders, these commercially determined health outcomes are rarely constructed in terms of health security threats. As is argued in the introduction to this special issue, vested interests at play mean that international public health efforts to limit harms are routinely stymied. Rather, the agenda is skewed against broader constructions of health security as part of an expanded human security framework or as a human right (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOgata_2003_a\" href=\"#rOgata_2003_a\">Ogata & Sen, 2003</a>). Much is therefore neglected from global health security in terms of threats to human health (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNunes_2016_a\" href=\"#rNunes_2016_a\">Nunes, 2016</a>), including a host of existential threats to health stemming from inequality and poverty, structural violence, lack of access to medicines and health services, and other drivers of human vulnerability such as climate change. Nevertheless, the perception of threat and its urgency is critical here (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMcinnes_2017_a\" href=\"#rMcinnes_2017_a\">McInnes & Roemer-Mahler, 2017</a>).",

This set in train a process where the needs for surveillance and response to infectious disease outbreaks and a whole gamut of new and old biological dangers should be subjected to intensified surveillance, with powers far outstripping the powers and resources imagined within the International Health Regulations of 1969, leading in turn to the revision of this regime by 2005 (Davies, Kamradt-Scott, & Rushton, 2015; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavies_2016_a\" href=\"#rDavies_2016_a\">Davies & Youde, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFidler_2006_a\" href=\"#rFidler_2006_a\">Fidler & Gostin, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKamradt-Scott_2012_a\" href=\"#rKamradt-Scott_2012_a\">Kamradt-Scott & Rushton, 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKatz_2010_a\" href=\"#rKatz_2010_a\">Katz & Fischer, 2010</a>). Other surveillance mechanisms have been developed including WHO\u2019s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and the linked Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN). These surveillance networks draw on reports of infectious disease events around the world, are regularly received by WHO through networks of laboratories and epidemiological sources via channels that include non-governmental organizations, and collect information and data via the press, internet and social media.",
            "As Weir and others note, the main sources of pandemic alerts, epidemics and notifiable outbreaks of infectious disease emerge from sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, and much of the effort underlying surveillance and containment initiatives in these regions lies with detection of outbreaks incidents in many resource poor countries with poor public health systems (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSastry_2012_a\" href=\"#rSastry_2012_a\">Sastry & Dutta, 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWeir_2014_a\" href=\"#rWeir_2014_a\">Weir, 2014</a>). The Global South is very much the principal source of infectious disease outbreaks in blunt global epidemiological terms (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJones_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rJones_et+al_2008_a\">Jones et al, 2008</a>), albeit with the structural drivers of this often simply passed over. The ostensible objective of surveillance may be to prevent outbreaks anywhere, including transmission within least developed countries, but the relationship between the surveillance network and overall return to the Global South is again problematic.",
            "Big Data in health security now preoccupies many agencies that are geared to potential pandemic threats and disease surveillance linked to national and international public health. For Roberts and Elbe this represents, at least in terms of syndromic surveillance, a departure from the basic paradigmatic approach of public health which has: sought to locate and report upon emergent infectious disease outbreaks, as opposed to determining averages and relative norms of existing disease trends within populations. GPHIN, too, was orientated not towards measuring and assessing the global burden of infectious disease among populations, but specifically towards capturing the emergence of new infectious disease outbreaks (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRoberts_2017_a\" href=\"#rRoberts_2017_a\">Roberts & Elbe, 2017</a>)",
            "This is precisely an exercise, therefore, in surveillance and control targeted at potentially fast interventions, rather than the use of statistics and disease burdens to make targeted or population level interventions targeted at prevention or elimination. Such statistics and data also ignore or mask the underlying problems and drivers of infectious disease, such as poverty, farming practices or lack of access to sanitation. The increased investment in and global availability of surveillance data also masks more fundamental problems with respect to disease control in many developing countries, as again the Ebola case amply illustrated (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFauci_2014_a\" href=\"#rFauci_2014_a\">Fauci, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHeymann_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rHeymann_et+al_2015_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHeymann_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rHeymann_et+al_2015_a\">Heymann et al, 2015</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNunes_2016_a\" href=\"#rNunes_2016_a\">Nunes, 2016</a>). Problems persist in the chronic lack of workforce in developing countries who can interpret epidemiological data (let alone Big Data); laboratory facilities in many countries either suffer from endemic shortages of equipment or inadequate standards and operating procedures; health information systems are often paper based and have no regional or nation system that is interoperable; and there is often a basic disjuncture between staff who are internally or externally trained in surveillance and epidemiology and those who respond to outbreaks (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCastillo-Salgado_2010_a\" href=\"#rCastillo-Salgado_2010_a\">Castillo-Salgado, 2010</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHeymann_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rHeymann_et+al_2015_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHeymann_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rHeymann_et+al_2015_a\">Heymann et al, 2015</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHeymann_2004_a\" href=\"#rHeymann_2004_a\">Heymann & Rodier, 2004</a>). Routine under-investment in all these areas continues warranting the question as to whose interests the global health security network really serves.",
            "Of course, problems also occur from the fact that a lot of the information gathered is accessible to the private sector and general public through public and private channels, including Big Data kept by social media and other web providers. Surveillance data (as almost other data sets) has a commercial value, albeit with its content and commercial application/exploitation with regard to health raising profound questions as to intrusiveness, ethics and commodification. Some have framed the Western health security and biosurveillance agenda in even less glowing terms than simple commercialism, wherein colonial approaches to contagion in the \u2018hot zones\u2019 have been replaced by managing disease spread through de-territorialized networks in which the surveillance of particular groups can be undertaken through the collection of relevant data. Such methods of surveillance and social control have recently intensified and further conflated the association of race/ethnicity with disease because of the development of a hypervigilance and a paradigm of suspicion after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 \u2013 all of which may have furthered the racialization of SARS as a \u2018Chinese disease\u2019(<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAli_2007_a\" href=\"#rAli_2007_a\">Ali & Keil, 2007</a>)",
            "It seems questionable as to whether this surveillance provides any of the wider advantages to resource poor countries, wherein investments in surveillance lead to improving other elements of national health systems (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChyba_1998_a\" href=\"#rChyba_1998_a\">Chyba, 1998</a>; Henderson, 1998; Heymann, 2003). As Stephen Morse, and Roberts and Elbe have noted socalled syndromic surveillance \u2013 or infodemiology and infoveillance \u2013 is demanding and out of reach in terms of informational technology resources, training and necessary investments in screening and reference capacities (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKeller_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rKeller_et+al_2009_a\">Keller et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMorse_2007_a\" href=\"#rMorse_2007_a\">Morse, 2007</a>, 2012) \u2013 and is more often than not non-diagnostic (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRoberts_2017_a\" href=\"#rRoberts_2017_a\">Roberts & Elbe, 2017</a>). International investment in enhanced surveillance capacities of any form are ostensibly welcome, but often do little for the ability of resource poor health systems to respond to biological threats (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMykhalovskiy_2006_a\" href=\"#rMykhalovskiy_2006_a\">Mykhalovskiy & Weir, 2006</a>). A deal of discursive analysis of media sources and policy statements following the Ebola outbreak tend to support these claims (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAbeysinghe_2011_a\" href=\"#rAbeysinghe_2011_a\">Abeysinghe & White, 2011</a>) with the routine depiction of Africa, in particular, as a cultural and traditional driver of epidemics. This racialized view is stressed over that of urbanization or global or regional trade (Foege, 1988; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGensini_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rGensini_et+al_2004_a\">Gensini, Yacoub, & Conti, 2004</a>). The health security agenda is therefore Western in its focus in more ways than the politics and interests it primarily serves. It also continues a history of pathologising and demonizing poverty or \u2018unclean\u2019 others blaming those from the South that, via their behaviours, place themselves outside constructions of secure biological citizenship.",
            "As Sara Davies, has noted the health security agenda is deeply \u2018statist\u2019 and, as indicated above, is also self-serving on the part of the West, Its agenda stands in opposition to what she views as an alternate and largely potential \u2018globalist\u2019, cosmopolitan and emancipatory health security (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavies_2008_a\" href=\"#rDavies_2008_a\">Davies, 2008</a>). There is much truth to this claim, and in many ways the bottom line in health security crises often reflects the wishes and sovereign capacities of the more powerful nations at least, and their ability to take action or permit action within their territories. For example, as Youde argues in the context of China\u2019s problematic response to its SARS crisis, despite being initially in denial as to that countries SARS outbreak and resistant to international surveillance efforts within its territory, the PRC eventually ceded to international monitoring and commenced efforts to publicly counter SARS (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYoude_2010_a\" href=\"#rYoude_2010_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYoude_2010_a\" href=\"#rYoude_2010_a\">Youde, 2010</a></a>). While this seems to confirm the zeitgeist that because infectious disease had the potential to cross boundaries, as SARS had done, this demanded the need for some of the de-territorialized and post-Westphalian responses that Fidler identifies as facilitated by the 2005 revisions to the IHRs (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFidler_2003_a\" href=\"#rFidler_2003_a\">Fidler, 2003</a>). However, as Youde asserts, much of the surveillance and response in China simply would not have happened without the resources and assent of the Chinese state (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYoude_2010_a\" href=\"#rYoude_2010_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYoude_2010_a\" href=\"#rYoude_2010_a\">Youde, 2010</a></a>). It is also clear that the US and other developed states would brook little or no external control or intrusion into their own ability to regulate disease or surveille biological threats at their borders or within their territories. Indeed, these states have regularly breached or contemplated defecting from the vaunted de-territorialized and post-Westphalian IHRs, as have many other countries in various pandemic threat events (Davies et al, 2015; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavis_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rDavis_et+al_2011_a\">Davis et al, 2011</a>).",
            "Nevertheless, the institutional trajectory of global health security is more nuanced with regard to the role of the state than these examples indicate. It is clear that when Davies refers to a statist literature she is indicating a number of key features of global health security (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavies_2008_a\" href=\"#rDavies_2008_a\">Davies, 2008</a>). First, states are at least legally responsible for the negotiation of and participation in many of the key institutions and treaties that make up the expanding health security regime complex, such as the IHRs, World Health Assembly and other sites of health governance, including new initiatives in the area of pandemic preparedness. Second, the state, military and agencies related to border protection, homeland security, intelligence and counterterrorism privilege states in terms of the crucial agency they have in international and domestic security. What is also clear is that Western states and the EU have the ability to also direct substantial resources toward the regearing of life sciences research toward national security and biosecurity lines (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHester_2015_a\" href=\"#rHester_2015_a\">Hester, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRajan_2006_a\" href=\"#rRajan_2006_a\">Rajan, 2006</a>).",
            "As Linda Weiss has argued, the international security concerns of the Cold War US state inspired exactly this type of investment into the nascent biotechnology research and start-ups (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWeiss_2014_a\" href=\"#rWeiss_2014_a\">Weiss, 2014</a>). This role has continued, particularly in the post-9/11 and under an ascendant global health security worldview.",
            "The state and militaries are themselves increasingly co-constructed and reconfigured by health agendas and agencies. For example, Elbe and others argue that there has been a cross pollination between health and the military under the new agenda with health technologies and countermeasures at the heart of collaborations (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rElbe_et+al_2015_a\">Elbe, Roemer-Mahler, & Long, 2015</a>). The relationship is influencing practices in health \u2013 for example, such as the involvement of the military in outbreak events and in the planning of medical countermeasures, as are security discourses in the construction of public health responses, investments and prioritization. But, for Elbe and colleagues at least, we see the steady influence upon the military of health, via various processes of pharmaceuticalization and molecularization of security, in which security and the military are now bound to technologies and discourses of health (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_2014_a\" href=\"#rElbe_2014_a\">Elbe, 2014</a>). Existing organizations such as the WHO have also been reconfigured by a global health security framing of biological threat. Not only has the organization acted as a norm entrepreneur for pandemic preparedness, with detailed planning for various phases of pandemics (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKamradt-Scott_2010_a\" href=\"#rKamradt-Scott_2010_a\">Kamradt-Scott, 2010</a>), it actions are indicative of how that organization effectively acted as the multilateral champion of the new security agenda, much to the chagrin of many of its member states (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSanford_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rSanford_et+al_2016_a\">Sanford, Polzer, & McDonough, 2016</a>), with a new Division of Emerging and Other Communicable Diseases created within the organization in 1995.",
            "As this brief review of the literature demonstrates, the GHSA has been conceptualized as narrow, western and statist. As such, it has been perceived as largely missing its mark in terms of developing a \u2018global\u2019 health security. Indeed, we see that the GHSA has in many ways weakened or ignored the needs of those in the global south. This has undoubtedly led to more biological precarity for the global poor with corresponding biological and economic vulnerability for the global north. Despite the statist nature of global health security, however, this sector has witnessed rapid institutional development and increasing hybridity between states and institutions across the globe. A raft of public-private organization, product development partnerships, university and state bureaucracies have all proliferated at the state and international level (David & Le Devedec, 2018). The range of new hybrid institutions in areas such as pandemic preparedness, medical countermeasures and antimicrobial resistance are breathtaking; many formed with an explicit health security agenda and involving multiple agencies (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cResnik_2013_a\" href=\"#rResnik_2013_a\">Resnik, 2013</a>). In keeping with many other areas of global health governance, we see increasing institutional formation in health security, more heterogeneity and overlapping mandates, and far more hybrid forms of governance between state and state organizations with the private sector. In other words, we are seeing increased integration of agendas, institutions, and forms of governance specifically directed at mitigating biological vulnerability.",
            "At the same time that the literature reveals the shortcomings of the GHSA and the institutional responses to these shortcomings, it also reveals its own biases toward framing its analyses with reference to security. Whether taking on the novelty of the securitization framework, shifting our ideas of whether security is reshaping pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutics are re-shaping security, or simply showing the effects of the entanglements of security and health, much of the literature on global health security has emphasized an analytic of security. This analytic has obscured other phenomena occurring alongside the much discussed conjoining of health and security. Notably, little has been said about how changing ideas of biology with advances in science and technology have led to a concomitant transformation in the economic stakes of health security, and a profound reshaping of health and security agendas as they become progressively entangled with the bioinformational. We need to apprehend these relationship to understand how health security, and its attendant political economy, is changing institutional configurations and creating new systems of biological exchange.",
            "When biological vulnerability became a commodity, an infinite source of profit making appeared and the global bioeconomy prospered again (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCaduff_2014_a\" href=\"#rCaduff_2014_a\">Caduff, 2014</a>).",
            "Taking a different tack than the literature in global health security outlined above, we argue that efforts to mitigate the vulnerability of human populations, and the vital systems that support them, have engendered a political economy of global health that not only fosters global biological exchange, but requires it. This political economy is built on and through the soma or body. The body at the heart of this political economy is not the same as the one imagined within the GHSA, however. It is neither a molar, whole individual body, nor is it a particular group or national population of human bodies. In this way, it differs from the medicalized body discussed by <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_2010_a\" href=\"#rElbe_2010_a\">Elbe (2010</a>). The bodies that concern us here include genomic bodies, molecular bodies, digital bodies, informational bodies, etc. made up of biological bits and bytes that are increasingly exchanged through global networks in both digital and analog form or in a combination of the two, which Thacker calls \u2018biomedia\u2019 (2004).",
            "Our conceptualization builds on a number of other industrial complexes that have historically focused on security, biology or both. For example, the idea of military industrial complex, first introduced into speech by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1951, signals the idea that legislators, the military, and the defense industry all play a strong role in a dense political economy of US security. More recent iterations of this security complex have turned toward biology, as has been exhibited through what has been labelled the \u2018Homeland Security Complex,\u2019 referring to the substantive build-up of the biodefense and biosecurity industries since 9/11 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLentzos_2009_a\" href=\"#rLentzos_2009_a\">Lentzos & Rose, 2009</a>). This massive biodefense infrastructure was, in turn, made possible by the emergence of another industrial complex based on biotechnology, what Kenney termed the \u2018university-industrial complex\u2019 in the 1980s (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKenney_1988_a\" href=\"#rKenney_1988_a\">Kenney, 1988</a>). Adele Clarke and her colleagues have also coined the \u2018Biomedicalization Complex Inc\u2019 to signal the technoscientific changes in the constitution, practices, and organization of contemporary biomedicine (Clarke, Mamo, Fosket, Fishman, & Shim, 2010). The biomedicalization complex includes, among other things, changes in the political economy of health, illness, disease and medicine. As she and her co-authors explain, \u2018a significant and growing proportion of capital globally is linked with things biological, biotechnological, and biomedical, including plant and animal agribusiness and \u201cacademic capitalism\u201d\u2019 (Clarke et al, 2010, p. 7).",
            "In this section, we take inspiration from these theorizations to draw together the ways that the biodefense industry, the life sciences, biomedicine and computer science have been brought together through post-Fordist logics to foster an industrial complex (and techno-scientific paradigm) that works in the service of health security and on the promise, if not the reality, of profitable and secure bodies. We call this the SSIC. Through the SSIC, informationalized understandings of biology are leading to techniques and strategies dedicated to exchanging biological life forms in order to both protect and grow the bioeconomy. In other words, we point up the productive aspects of harnessing informationalized forms of biological networks and exchange for political economic reasons. If, as Nikolas Rose has argued, in the vital politics of the twenty-first century, the existence of humans becomes a focus of government; the target of novel forms of authority and expertise; a highly cathected field for knowledge; an expanding territory for bioeconomic exploitation; an organizing principle for ethics and the stake in a molecular politics; then, we argue that these vital politics are increasingly exercised in and through an understanding of life as information (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRose_2007_a\" href=\"#rRose_2007_a\">Rose, 2007</a>).",
            "In the twenty-first century, the management of health has been reconfigured as a result of changing rationalities and technologies of government, and health security is proving unexceptional in this wider process. Rather than managing birth, illness, reproduction and death, the biopolitics of the \u2018century of biology\u2019 look quite different (Dyson, 2007; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVenter_2004_a\" href=\"#rVenter_2004_a\">Venter & Cohen, 2004</a>). For Rose, this \u2018politics of life itself\u2019 is \u2018neither delimited by the poles of illness and health, nor focused on eliminating pathology to protect the destiny of the nation. Rather, it is concerned with our growing capacities to control, manage, engineer, reshape and modulate the very vital capacities of human beings as living creatures\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRose_2009_a\" href=\"#rRose_2009_a\">Rose, 2009</a>). One of the ways that our vital capacities are managed and modulated is by understanding and treating them in terms of information.",
            "Historian Lily E. Kay explains that the conceptualization, breaking and completion of the genetic code was not only one of the most important scientific episodes in twentieth-century science, it was also the beginning of a new way to see the world. She calls this new worldview the \u2018molecular vision of life\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKay_2000_a\" href=\"#rKay_2000_a\">Kay, 2000</a>). Within this vision, the human genome came to be viewed as a book in which life itself could be read, written, copied and edited and biological life was no longer constrained by the apparent normativity of a natural vital order. Rather, biology had itself become an information technology to be re-written, re-designed and redeployed for political purposes. (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRose_2007_a\" href=\"#rRose_2007_a\">Rose, 2007</a>, p. 5). While Kay is quick to point out that the genetic code is not a language, this has not precluded the idea that it is information. Such an informationalized understanding of life itself has proliferated within scientific and security circles with important implications for our understandings of and response to biological vulnerability.",
            "As genetic codes and computer codes have become more entangled in more complex and sophisticated ways over time, the biological body is increasingly thought of in cybernetic terms. These include the encoded body (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThacker_2003_a\" href=\"#rThacker_2003_a\">Thacker, 2003</a>), the body as password (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAas_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rAas_et+al_2008_a\">Aas, Gundhus, & Lomell, 2008</a>), informationalized life (Dillon & Lobo-Guerrero, 2008) and the flesh made word (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGere_2006_a\" href=\"#rGere_2006_a\">Gere & Parry, 2006</a>). The emergence of systems biology has furthered the overlapping ideas and realities of networked digital and analog life. For example, in his book Wetware: A computer in every living cell, Dennis Bray (2009) writes of cellular computations, molecular circuits and neural nets, not as metaphors, but as ontological features inherent to molecular biology. Altogether, these conceptualizations contribute to the formation of a new technological frame based on what Thacker calls biomedia (2004). Within this frame, \u2018theories of biological life (the common trope of the \u201cgenetic code\u201d) are intimately connected to practices of engineering, programming and design\u2014for instance in how the genetic code in a test tube is implemented in on-line genomic databases\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThacker_2004_a\" href=\"#rThacker_2004_a\">Thacker, 2004</a>, p. 2).",
            "Biology as information, code, media, or text has come to be understood as an emergent form of life itself insofar as it can be created, edited, transcribed and produced in the virtual realm. Indeed, with biomedia \u2018the biological and digital domains are no longer rendered ontologically distinct, but are instead seen to inhere in each other; the biological \u201cinforms\u201d the digital, just as the digital \u201ccorporealizes\u201d the biological\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThacker_2004_a\" href=\"#rThacker_2004_a\">Thacker, 2004</a>, p. 7). Dangers associated with such encoded and emergent biology do not just stay in the realm of the virtual, however. Embodied data can be broken into and tinkered with, as in recent concerns over \u2018biohacking.\u2019 With the aid of computer technology, genetic data can be spliced, recombined and transformed into a deadly pathogen that can be released into the public domain. When this happens, as in the case of the use of military grade weaponized Anthrax in 2001, the \u2018pathogenic qualities of information\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThacker_2001_a\" href=\"#rThacker_2001_a\">Thacker, 2001</a>) literally become embodied. Finally, as concerns with biological vulnerability illustrate, globally networked biological life has catastrophic potential.",
            "Yet, informationalized biology also has economic potential, and has a health security potential that can be commercialized. Sunder Rajan has coined the term \u2018lively capital\u2019 to signal the ways in which \u2018the life sciences are increasingly incorporated into market regimes\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRajan_2012_a\" href=\"#rRajan_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRajan_2012_a\" href=\"#rRajan_2012_a\">Rajan, 2012</a></a>). He argues that the rise of the entrepreneurial university, as well as the corporatization of the life sciences, and the naturalization of this corporatization have led to a dynamic in which biological matter and the technologies used to control, manage, engineer, reshape and modulate living systems increasingly operate under the sign of the market, of capitalist exchange and value (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRajan_2012_a\" href=\"#rRajan_2012_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRajan_2012_a\" href=\"#rRajan_2012_a\">Rajan, 2012</a></a>). This incorporation has been possible because the life sciences are understood as information sciences, but not exclusively because of this.",
            "There have also been concomitant changes in the legal, regulatory, and market structures that have shaped the conduct of the life sciences, as well as the understandings and uses of its products. For example, ideas about what constitutes \u2018life\u2019 have changed, as have the legal frameworks that distinguish whether particular life forms belong in the realm of nature or culture and thus are public or private (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJasanoff_2012_a\" href=\"#rJasanoff_2012_a\">Jasanoff, 2012</a>). As these shifts have occurred, biology has increasingly been understood as a form of capital, or \u2018biocapital\u2019 and the life sciences as an academic endeavour have merged with the industries of biotechnology and biodefense (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRajan_2006_a\" href=\"#rRajan_2006_a\">Rajan, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWright_2004_a\" href=\"#rWright_2004_a\">Wright, 2004</a>). Such a convergence has been seen by some as not only inevitable, but unstoppable. \u201cGiven the size, momentum, and global dissemination of the bioscientific enterprise and the great demand for the medical and agricultural products being created, the rapid global advance of bioscience is essentially unstoppable (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSmith_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rSmith_et+al_2003_a\">Smith, Inglesby, & O\u2019Toole, 2003</a>). Others, however, have read the turn to military applications in the life sciences as a way to rescue a flagging biotechnology industry (Cooper, 2008).",
            "Fostered by the hope and the hype of biotechnology, biocapital is generated through the use, ownership, reproduction and sharing of biological information. As such, it is a changing, mutable and networked form of capital that is central to the bioeconomy, to the knowledge economy, and to biodefense in the twenty-first century. Peters uses the term \u2018bio-informational capitalism\u2019 to signal the form of capitalism. He describes it thus: Bio-informational capitalism is the emergent form of fourth or fifth generational capitalism based on investments and returns in these new bio-industries: after mercantile, industrial, and knowledge capitalisms. This is a form of capitalism based on a self-organizing and self-replicating code that harnesses both the results of the information and new biology revolutions and brings them together in a powerful alliance that enhances and strengthens or reinforces each other (2012:105).",
            "Feminist scholars writing about the (re)productive nature of capital have adeptly outlined the contours of a political economy based on self-replication and regeneration. For example, Melinda Cooper and Catherine Waldby (2014) argue that postFordist economies blur the boundaries between the reproductive and productive spheres turning even the most intimate of bodily functions into exchangeable commodities and services. They coin the idea of \u2018clinical labor\u2019 to signal \u2018the multifarious ways that biotechnical processes of \u201clife itself\u201d are involved in networks of commercial transaction and capital accumulation\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCooper_2014_a\" href=\"#rCooper_2014_a\">Cooper & Waldby, 2014</a>, p. 5). Tracking shifts in the conceptualization of \u2018life itself\u2019 from Fordist to post-Fordist economies, they argue that it is now the in vivo biology of human subjects that is enrolled in the post-Fordist labor process. For this reason, they conclude that \u2018any theory of the value of work must become a theory of the value of life\u2019 (2014:6).",
            "The work of Charis Thompson exemplifies the kind of regenerative political economy signalled by Cooper and Waldby. Through the study of artificial reproductive technologies (ART\u2019s), Thompson theorizes a \u2018biomedical mode of reproduction\u2019 that differs from other modes of production. She explains, \u2018where once labor produced things that make profit, and workers could be alienated from the profits of their labor, now bodies reproduce things that make profit, and bodies can be alienated from the profits of their reproduction\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThompson_2005_a\" href=\"#rThompson_2005_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThompson_2005_a\" href=\"#rThompson_2005_a\">Thompson, 2005</a></a>, p. 7). Extracted body parts (in this case embryos, gametes, sperm, etc.) have latent value insofar as they can produce new life forms. Because of this, both the value and the labor potential of extracted body parts are promissory. Such potential is immanent to the extracted parts even as they languish in the freezer \u2013 a reserve army of labor\u2013 waiting to be made (re)productive. The latent status of such alienated labor reshapes the temporality of biocapital. As Thompson explains, the biomedical mode of reproduction represents a change in the temporal dimension that is relevant to assigning economic values to a more future-oriented unfolding. \u2018Likewise, it signals a shift away from production, productivity, and profit toward knowledge, technologies of life, and promise\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThompson_2005_a\" href=\"#rThompson_2005_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThompson_2005_a\" href=\"#rThompson_2005_a\">Thompson, 2005</a></a>, p. 249). In sum, it signals a shift toward an technological frame of (re)production that, in turn, engenders a promissory political economy of mobile and exchangeable biological bits.",
            "Taken together, these theorizations point to changing conceptualizations of life and concomitant transformations in labor, value, (re)production, and forms of capitalism that (in)form the SSIC. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLazzarato_2004_a\" href=\"#rLazzarato_2004_a\">Lazzarato (2004</a>) describes these changes as a shift from capital-labour to capital-life. As a result of this shift, he argues, we have to change our principles of valuation and the ways we understand the value of value. We must also develop new concepts of wealth and production.",
            "In the face of such a proposal, and against the idea that biological exchange is a zero-sum proposition, we can ask new questions and look for new answers in global health security. What, for instance, is the value of a virus or an infectious disease beyond their potential to engender fear and aggrandize political control? How can we think about the benefits for the state and private actors of making flu virus (re)productive? What is the latent labor that lies within informationalized forms of biology and how can this labor be drawn on to promise, if not provide, wealth? Building on our theorization of the SSIC, we now turn to a discussion of virus sharing as a way to offer partial answers to these questions by showing how the political economy of global health security relies on the latent labor of informationalized biology. In order to be made productive, however, this informationalized life form must be exchanged and circulated. In the absence of biological exchange, both global health security and the somatic political economy it relies upon are jeopardized.",
            "Global biological exchange and global health security: the case of global virus sharing",
            "Given the conceptualization of biology as valuable information and as an essential referent object in new health security, it is no surprise that information technologies have become a central mechanism for managing the development and proliferation of biological exchanges in global health. For example, the GHSA, is working to implement a broad set of endeavours including the establishment of a real-time global biosurveillance network, increased laboratory capacity in all partner countries, and a supportive global regulatory and scientific infrastructure. Notably, all of these rely on the exchange of informationalized biology. One activity that has been central to achieving global health security goals is that of virus sharing, especially influenza virus, for global pandemic preparedness. According to the WHO, \u2018The sharing of viruses facilitates pandemic risk assessment, the development of candidate vaccine viruses, updating of diagnostic reagents and test kits, and surveillance for resistance to antiviral medicines\u2019 (WHO fact sheet). Biological exchange in the form of viruses is thus foundational to all aspects of global health security.",
            "One of the primary initiatives dedicated to virus sharing is the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Formerly known as the Global Influenza Surveillance Network, the GISRS is touted as a \u2018model platform for global collaboration and timely sharing of viruses, reagents and information to forestall and respond to public health emergencies\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHay_2018_a\" href=\"#rHay_2018_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHay_2018_a\" href=\"#rHay_2018_a\">Hay & McCauley, 2018</a></a>). Begun in 1952, just on the heels of the formation of the World Health Organization and as an initiative of that organization, GISRS has kept up with scientific and medical advances over the decades. For example, flu surveillance techniques within this initiative have moved away from the isolation of viruses to increasing reliance on gene sequencing, including whole-genome sequencing, for virus characterization. Successful flu surveillance has also built on advanced communication technologies for distributing informationalized biology, including virus genetic sequence data and associated information, as well as viruses and reference reagents (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHay_2018_a\" href=\"#rHay_2018_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHay_2018_a\" href=\"#rHay_2018_a\">Hay & McCauley, 2018</a></a>).",
            "Over the years, GISRS has grown to incorporate approximately 60% of WHO member states and 152 institutions in global flu surveillance. This expansion has partly been due to recent threats from zoonotic diseases including avian flu (H5N1) in Hong Kong in 1997, 2003 re-emergence and spread of H5N1, and the subsequent outbreaks of SARS coronavirus and zoonotic H7N7 influenza (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHay_2018_a\" href=\"#rHay_2018_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHay_2018_a\" href=\"#rHay_2018_a\">Hay & McCauley, 2018</a></a>). It has also been due to its ability to rapidly generate information that can lead to the development of a vaccine. As Hay and McCauley explain, \u2018A crucial aspect of GISRS and part of its success is meeting the strict timelines for vaccine virus selection and the manufacture and quality control of vaccine, prior to distribution, a process that takes 6\u20138 months\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHay_2018_a\" href=\"#rHay_2018_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHay_2018_a\" href=\"#rHay_2018_a\">Hay & McCauley, 2018</a></a>).",
            "As this brief introduction to the GISRS shows, the WHO global flu surveillance system is built on a long-standing tradition of flu surveillance and on the good faith sharing of informationalized biology in both digital and analog form. Indeed, global flu surveillance requires the constant and open sharing of health data in order to detect an outbreak of concern or a pandemic. At the same time, it requires the circulation of biological materials, including virus samples and reagents, to be able to identify specific flu strains. Finally, it necessitates a commitment from member states to continue to participate in its activities. This continued participation is difficult to maintain in the absence of an imminent biological threat, however. Hay and McCauley explain that in the absence of a biological crisis \u2018sustainability is not guaranteed, especially if none of the perceived pandemic threats materialise and resources are judged to be better employed elsewhere\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHay_2018_a\" href=\"#rHay_2018_a\">Hay & McCauley, 2018</a>). The on-going perception of global biological vulnerability, as well as the on-going participation and trust of member states in virus sharing are important to the continued implementation of GSIRS. So, too, is the ability to circulate and distribute various biomediated forms of virus and attendant knowledge and materials through the on-going maintenance and control of a global data repository.",
            "Given the long-standing success of GSIRS, it was a surprise then, when in 2007, Indonesia very publicly refused to share samples of avian flu virus A (H5N1) with the WHO and other major global players (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_2010_a\" href=\"#rElbe_2010_a\">Elbe, 2010</a>; Lo\u20acfgren & Williams, 2016). Citing a breakdown of trust and a lack of benefits accruing to developing countries, including Indonesia, it demanded that vaccines should be available to all countries at risk of being affected at a minimal price that these countries are able to afford, as well as full use and leverage of in-country resources. Until that time, it would not share its samples. In response to its refusal, Indonesia was criticized for \u2018withholding\u2019 genetic data and WHO officials warned that Indonesia was putting \u2018the public health security of the whole world at risk\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCaplan_2007_a\" href=\"#rCaplan_2007_a\">Caplan & Curry 2007</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSedyaningsih_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rSedyaningsih_et+al_2008_a\">Sedyaningsih, Isfandari, Soendoro, & Supari, 2008</a>).",
            "Indonesia\u2019s refusal to share viral samples put into stark relief the importance of biological exchange to the GHSA, not only with regard to preparing the global community for a possible pandemic, but also with regard to continuing to provide the biological information necessary for pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine. Sedyaningsih and colleagues explain the dynamic: Disease affected countries, which are usually developing countries, provide information and share biological specimens/virus with the WHO system; then pharmaceutical industries of developed countries obtain free access to this information and specimens, produce and patent the products (diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics or other technologies), and sell them back to the developing countries at unaffordable prices. Although it is general knowledge that this practice has been going on for a long time for other major communicable diseases \u2013not just for avian influenza \u2013 the fear of potential pandemic influenza has magnified this gap (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSedyaningsih_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rSedyaningsih_et+al_2008_a\">Sedyaningsih et al, 2008</a>).",
            "At stake in this dispute were diverging views on the benefits of biological exchange, and commodification of biological resources in the name of health security. Sedyaningsih and colleagues describe the discrepancy, explaining that, while one party insists on the importance of free, non-conditional virus sharing for risk assessment and risk response (the basic threat response logic of global health security), the other stresses the more basic principles such as sovereignty of a country over its biological materials, transparency of the global system, and equity between developed and developing nations (2008). Shawn Smallman puts the dynamic into sharper relief suggesting that, while for developed nations the controversy was about health security, for Indonesia and other developing countries, viral sample sharing was a form of biopiracy, which maintains neocolonial relationships and ensures the dependency of developing countries upon the developed world (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSmallman_2013_a\" href=\"#rSmallman_2013_a\">Smallman, 2013</a>). Smallman describes how Indonesia\u2019s Minister of Health was fearful that, with intellectual property laws permitting the patenting of life forms, Indonesian virus samples would also be patented and unavailable to Indonesia. In the face of such a possibility, Supari argued for \u2018viral sovereignty.\u2019 Equating the extraction of Indonesian viral material with the extraction of other forms of biological materials like seeds and spices from their own countries, developing countries supported Indonesia\u2019s viral sovereignty argument.",
            "In response to the controversy, 20 developing countries entered a resolution to the World Health Assembly \u2018calling for a new international framework to be set up for the sharing of avian influenza viruses, to review the existing WHO research system, and to prioritize the manufacture and availability of vaccines in developing countries\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKhor_2007_a\" href=\"#rKhor_2007_a\">Khor, 2007</a>). The US rejected this resolution but Indonesia continued to push its position arguing against claims that they were undermining global health security with their actions. In 2011, an agreement was finally reached that recognized the sovereign right of States over their biological resources and instantiated a global framework for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP). The PIP framework ensured the flows of viral samples to flu manufacturers on a no preference basis, but the pharmaceutical companies that would manufacture the vaccines were largely in western nations. Thus, although viral samples would continue to circulate, their circulation would bolster the bio-manufacturing industries of Western countries.",
            "The Indonesian virus sharing case is interesting for our purposes because it is often read as a controversy between diverging positions. Yet, there is more similarity in the two positions than is apparent at first brush. While the controversy has largely been framed in terms of the challenge it posed to health security, it can also be framed in terms of the opportunity it posed for the political economy of global health security (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_2010_a\" href=\"#rElbe_2010_a\">Elbe, 2010</a>). For example, the urgency with which Western nations pushed for Indonesia to build up its reference laboratory capacity in the face of the outbreak was both so that these nations could protect their own populations against biological vulnerability, but also so they could profit from this vulnerability by exploiting the latent labor of informationalized Indonesian biology. Indeed, this was the position of Indonesian scholars: Poor countries have no bargaining position because their participation in the production of these products is not valued as they are \u2018just\u2019 natural resources (clinical specimens, viruses, and other microbes); on the other hand, the industrialized countries\u2019 contributions are highly valued because they are human invented technology. (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSedyaningsih_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rSedyaningsih_et+al_2008_a\">Sedyaningsih et al, 2008</a>, p. 487)",
            "Yet, while there is clearly a basis to claim that the exchange of biological information facilitates the extraction of embodied labor for purposes of generating biocapital in Western nations, the exchange of biological information was in everyone\u2019s interest, including Indonesia, who argued forcefully that its virus samples should be transformed into a meaningful health intervention by Western pharmaceutical companies and then returned to their country of origin as vaccines. In other words, they, like their global counterparts, were interested in facilitating and promoting biological exchange in the face of biological insecurity. The systems of exchange were predicated on inequality and an unequal system of biological exchange. In this case, flu virus held promissory potential for all of the actors involved. This potential was embedded in its (re)productive abilities and could be drawn on in different times and places, and for different purposes, to benefit all of the countries involved.",
            "Taking a step back from the Indonesia controversy, we can see that although valuable in itself, the biological information exchanged within the GSIRS and other virus sharing initiatives like GISAID takes on increased value when the virus can be transformed into something else, like a proprietary vaccine. It can also have a latent and transformable value once it is deposited into a virus databank, like Flunet or FluID. Insofar as these databases can be mined for genetic and health information by countries with strong data infrastructures and advanced research and manufacturing capabilities, these viral data repositories promise not just health security, but often vast economic returns. In other words, the value of informationalized biology exceeds its original form insofar it can be made to produce other values or products like medical devices. For this reason, Hay and McCauley suggest that the wider benefits that flow from access to the latest data provided by GISRS are evident in the advanced tools and platforms available for analyzing and interpreting sequence data not necessarily in the vaccines they produce (2018).",
            "As this case shows, biological exchange is an important economic and political imperative not only for the latent potential that informationalized biology contains, but also for the value that this latent potential holds for achieving global health security. Like the gametes, embryos and other biomaterials discussed above, viruses at once represent a reserve army of biological labor that can be made productive based on the need, the time and the capacity of the actor. At the same time, they represent a latent form of promissory biocapital within a system of bio-informational capitalism that can be transformed into medical devices and countermeasures, as well as affective investments in a future free from flu, and toward a global health security shaped by narrow interests and agendas. It is their life giving and life-changing possibilities that (in)form their use, a use that is, in turn, shaped by those who can exercise viral sovereignty. This is the somatic security industrial complex at work.",
            "In many ways there is nothing new about the fact that health, security and capitalism are mutually entangled (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHowell_2014_a\" href=\"#rHowell_2014_a\">Howell, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKing_2002_a\" href=\"#rKing_2002_a\">King, 2002</a>). There is also, in some ways, nothing new about the conceptualization of the body in terms of exchange and circulation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBraun_2007_a\" href=\"#rBraun_2007_a\">Braun, 2007</a>). Nevertheless, these historic entanglements have shifted with parallel advances in the science and technology of biology and cybernetics, and with the intensification of globalization. Whereas global circulation and exchange were once limited by the scope and scale of air and sea transportation, and biology was understood in terms of whole organisms or groups of organisms, the \u2018molecular turn\u2019 in biology, coincident with and informed by the burgeoning field of cybernetics, reduced our understanding of life to a submicroscopic level while simultaneously reconfiguring our understandings of life as \u2018code\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKay_1993_a\" href=\"#rKay_1993_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKay_1993_a\" href=\"#rKay_1993_a\">Kay, 1993</a></a>). At the same time, cybernetic science expanded our global networks of exchange into the virtual space of the internet. As a result of these changes, biological laboratories were transformed into highly technologized environments, biological research found commercial applications, and biological life came to be understood in terms of networked information that could, and should, circulate on a global level (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKay_1993_a\" href=\"#rKay_1993_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKay_1993_a\" href=\"#rKay_1993_a\">Kay, 1993</a></a>; Kenney, 1998). It is these transformations that have concerned us here.",
            "The reconfigurations of health, security and capitalism outlined here have important implications both for the kinds of informationalized bodies that are being secured and for the purposes of securing those bodies in global health security. Flesh made data and data made flesh (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKroker_2012_a\" href=\"#rKroker_2012_a\">Kroker, 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThacker_2005_a\" href=\"#rThacker_2005_a\">Thacker, 2005</a>) have made biology a physical and metaphoric source of information, and a valuable commodity, that is networked with other sources of information in circuits and flows that require technological, political and economic management. All of this has led to new forms of security based not on preventing biological exchange, but on promoting and even proliferating it. It has also led to the creation of new global health security expertise and an epistemic community. Indeed, Rose argues that the management of health has devolved to a host of \u2018somatic experts\u2019 working in quasiautonomous regulatory bodies such as bioethics commissions, private corporations like biotechnology companies, and medical associations, among others (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRose_2007_a\" href=\"#rRose_2007_a\">Rose, 2007</a>). As this article suggests, however, these more distributed and networked forms of life demand a different set of experts. It is increasingly bioengineers, computer scientists, bio-designers, statisticians, and security experts, rather than bioethicists and life scientists, who are in charge of managing, engineering and modulating our vital capacities in the politics of (informational) life itself. Security becomes the focal point and legitimizing device for corporate activities and control over these areas.",
            "While much of the global health security literature has focused on the potentially catastrophic economic and biological implications, especially for Western nations, of global biological interaction, it has failed to grapple with the productive aspects of networked biology. In order to shed light on this other side of biological exchange, we have shown how understandings of biological life, capitalism and security have all been reconfigured, both together and separately. These reconfigurations have led to the emergence of a somatic security industrial complex focused on both protecting and proliferating bioinformation in order to grow the bioeconomy, all while keeping populations healthy and secure and bodies productive. In this regard, the SSIC is also in many ways statist, western, and narrowly defined, albeit in this a case in the name of biological exchange rather than to counter it.",
            "One of the most vexing questions within this complex, however, is that of the emerging pattern of ownership and political economy of new life (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPeters_2012_a\" href=\"#rPeters_2012_a\">Peters, 2012</a>). Who will own and control these new life forms and what will such ownership mean? As OECD countries increasingly move toward developing bio-based economies, dominance of biological information is vital, and playing the \u2018security card\u2019 becomes even more appealing as a means of legitimizing private and public investments leading to corporate ownership. Geopolitical struggles for dominance can already be seen in the growing tensions between the US and China regarding China\u2019s acquisition of large data sets of American\u2019s genetic and health information (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPauwels_2017_a\" href=\"#rPauwels_2017_a\">Pauwels & Vidyarthi, 2017</a>). The information exchange is hardly reciprocal, however, as \u2018Even as Chinese groups take stakes in US biomedical companies, Chinese regulations prevent foreign companies from taking genetic data out of China\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLynch_2017_a\" href=\"#rLynch_2017_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLynch_2017_a\" href=\"#rLynch_2017_a\">Lynch, 2017</a></a>). Members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation have expressed scepticism about China\u2019s intentions with regard to ownership and use of U.S genetic data not because they could eventually exercise biological control over the U.S population, but because they could gain economic control over the data, and perhaps the population. Thus, \u2018The economic impact is the principal near-term threat \u2014 the monetization of large data sets\u2019 said one FBI agent (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLynch_2017_a\" href=\"#rLynch_2017_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLynch_2017_a\" href=\"#rLynch_2017_a\">Lynch, 2017</a></a>), but population control by a foreign economic power looms large in the language surrounding the FBI investigation. It is telling that the US does not want China to take \u2018it\u2019s\u2019 biological information, but has vocally criticized Indonesia for playing the same game. All of this points toward the increasing importance of biological information not only for achieving global health security, but for attaining economic dominance in the \u2018century of biology.\u2019 The SSIC is certainly deeply divisive in terms of a number of pivotal institutional, ethical and commercial relationships fundamental to the emerging biological global order.",
            "Given its stake in maintaining this dominance, it is imperative from the point of view of the US that biological information continue to circulate and be exchanged. After all, and mirroring the self-generating technologies it is promoting, \u2018the life sciences have played a commanding role in America\u2019s strategies of economic and imperialist self-reinvention\u2019 (Cooper, 2008, p. 4). When this circulation is forestalled or prevented, as in the case of Indonesia failing to share its flu virus or when China both harbors the genetic information of its population and seeks to purchase that of other countries including the US, both the geopolitical dominance and economic well-being of those most invested in global health security are at stake. It is for this reason that we argue that, to the extent that the political economy of global health security relies on an informationalized form of life and insofar as western nations are leading the GHSA, the proliferation and promotion rather than the prevention and mitigation of biological exchange is central to the political economy of global health security today."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "To conclude, the political economy we outline here has already been signalled through the theorization of novel state-market relations built around molecules (see Elbe and Long in this issue); in new forms of capital built around biology and pharmaceuticals (Sunder Rajan, 2006); new forms of global health financing (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSands_2017_a\" href=\"#rSands_2017_a\">Sands & Chawla, 2017</a>); and in wider research on the emerging bioeconomy (Cooper, 2008; Dietz, Bo\u20acrner, Fo\u20acrster, & von Braun, 2018). Nevertheless, these works do not explicitly address the way that the informationalization of life itself plays a central role in all of these phenomena and in contributing to the emergence of what we refer to as the somatic security industrial complex. This complex relies on the latent labor of informationalized life and seeks to harness its (re)productive potential through biological exchange. If, as Nikolas Rose has written, the politics of life itself involves a somatic ethics which \u2018accords a particular moral virtue to the search for profit through the management of life\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRose_2007_a\" href=\"#rRose_2007_a\">Rose, 2007</a>, p. 8) then somatic security accords a certain level of assurance that the varied species of biocapital and associated forms of embodied labor and biological exchanges that are central to making biological life live will be protected and promoted through a growing complex of political and economic forces."

        "Starting from the premise that biology has been informationalized, we argue that biological exchange is not only a threat to humans and the institutional structures they create, it is also, importantly, a political and economic opportunity for firms and core states involved in global health security, and one of the key bases for an emergent global political economy of health security",
        "Akin to Naomi Klein\u2019s argument on disaster capitalism, in which profit is to be made and power is to be gained from the misfortunes of others, we argue that global bioinsecurities present a political economic opportunity, especially for Western states and institutions, to protect and grow their bio-economies and thus to bolster both their geopolitical power and national economic interests (Klein, 2007)",
        "To capture the political economy that is sedimenting around networked forms of informationalized biology, we introduce the idea of a somatic-security industrial complex (SSIC)",
        "To take this forward we provide a brief review of the global health security literature showing how the global health security agenda (GHSA) largely focuses on the idea that infectious disease is an existential threat to western nations and how this perception engenders a narrow, western and statist response bent on defending against the dangers of biological exchange",
        "Rather than focus on bodies swept up in the unpredictable \u2018biological cauldron\u2019 of the twenty-first century, we focus on the ways that they are promoted, modulated, and managed in the name of global health security (Braun, 2007)",
        "Taking a different tack than the literature in global health security outlined above, we argue that efforts to mitigate the vulnerability of human populations, and the vital systems that support them, have engendered a political economy of global health that not only fosters global biological exchange, but requires it",
        "If, as Nikolas Rose has argued, in the vital politics of the twenty-first century, the existence of humans becomes a focus of government; the target of novel forms of authority and expertise; a highly cathected field for knowledge; an expanding territory for bioeconomic exploitation; an organizing principle for ethics and the stake in a molecular politics; then, we argue that these vital politics are increasingly exercised in and through an understanding of life as information (Rose, 2007)",
        "In order to shed light on this other side of biological exchange, we have shown how understandings of biological life, capitalism and security have all been reconfigured, both together and separately",
        "It is for this reason that we argue that, to the extent that the political economy of global health security relies on an informationalized form of life and insofar as western nations are leading the GHSA, the proliferation and promotion rather than the prevention and mitigation of biological exchange is central to the political economy of global health security today"
