            "Comment present with diarrhoea, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool and blood samples.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] This evidence implicates the possibility of viral exposure in the liver. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the target cell,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] where the virus replicates and subsequently infects other cells in the upper respiratory tract and lung tissue; patients then begin to have clinical symptoms and manifestations. Pathological studies in patients with SARS confirmed the presence of the virus in liver tissue, although the viral titre was relatively low because viral inclusions were not observed.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] In patients with MERS, viral particles were not detectable in liver tissue.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), a diagnostic biomarker for cholangiocyte injury, has not been reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies; we found that it was elevated in 30 (54%) of 56 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalisation in our centre (unpublished). We also found that elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were observed in one (1\u00b78%) of 56 patients with COVID-19 during hospitalisation. A preliminary study (albeit not peer-reviewed) suggested that ACE2 receptor expression is enriched in cholangiocytes,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] indicating that SARS-CoV-2 might directly bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes to dysregulate liver function. Nevertheless, pathological analysis of liver tissue from a patient who died from COVID-19 showed that viral inclusions were not observed in the liver.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]",
            "It is also possible that the liver impairment is due to drug hepatotoxicity, which might explain the large variation observed across the different cohorts. In addition, immune-mediated inflammation, such as cytokine storm and pneumonia-associated hypoxia, might also contribute to liver injury or even develop into liver failure in patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.",
            "Liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 is often transient and can return to normal without any special treatment. However, when severe liver damage occurs, liver protective drugs have usually been given to such patients in our unit.",
            "Chronic liver disease represents a major disease burden globally. Liver diseases including chronic viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcohol-related liver disease affect approximately 300 million people in China. Given this high burden, how different underlying liver conditions influence liver injury in patients with",
            "COVID-19 needs to be meticulously evaluated. However, the exact cause of pre-existing liver conditions has not been outlined in the case studies of COVID-19 and the interaction between existing liver disease and COVID-19 has not been studied. Immune dysfunction\u2014including lymphopenia, decreases of CD4+ T-cell levels, and abnormal cytokine levels (including cytokine storm)\u2014 is a common feature in cases of COVID-19 and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality. For patients with chronic hepatitis B in immunotolerant phases or with viral suppression under long-term treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues, evidence of persistent liver injury and active viral replication after co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 need to be further investigated. In patients with COVID-19 with autoimmune hepatitis, the effects of administration of glucocorticoids on disease prognosis is unclear. Given the expression of the ACE2 receptor in cholangiocytes, whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 aggravates cholestasis in patients with primary biliary cholangitis, or leads to an increase in alkaline phosphatase and GGT, also needs to be monitored. Moreover, patients with COVID-19 with liver cirrhosis or liver cancer might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection because of their systemic immunocompromised status. The severity, mortality, and incidence of complications in these patients, including secondary infection, hepatic encephalopathy, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver failure, need to be examined in large-cohort clinical studies.",
            "Considering their immunocompromised status, more intensive surveillance or individually tailored therapeutic approaches is needed for severe patients with COVID-19 with pre-existing conditions such as advanced liver disease, especially in older patients with other comorbidities. Further research should focus on the causes of liver injury in COVID-19 and the effect of existing liver-related comorbidities on treatment and outcome of COVID-19.",
