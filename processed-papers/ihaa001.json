        "abstract": "Background\n                  Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human\u2013animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  This study explored the relationship among zoonotic risk and human behaviour, environment and policies in rural communities in southern China. It identifies key behavioural risk factors that can be targeted for development of tailored risk-mitigation strategies to reduce the threat of novel zoonoses.",

            "Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases are key contributors to morbidity and mortality in southern China.1,2 This region, considered a \u2018hotspot\u2019 for emerging zoonotic diseases, harbours abundant wildlife while also undergoing land use change and natural resource overexploitation leading to intensified human\u2013 animal interactions that favour the emergence of zoonotic diseases.3 People living in the rural areas of southern China primarily cultivate rice and fruits, raise swine and poultry in households or on small farms,4 but also traditionally hunt wild animals as an alternative income source.5 The mixed landscape has abundant crops, which attracts wild animals into the communities, and livestock rearing is common.6 This brings humans and animals into close contact in dense populations, creating a wildlife\u2013livestock\u2013 human interface for zoonotic disease emergence.7<br/><br/>In recognition of the challenges of emerging infectious diseases after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 caused by a bat-origin coronavirus, the Chinese government established a national real-time hospital-based infectious disease reporting system.1 Likewise, live poultry market interventions were initiated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in southern China in 2001.8 In December 2019 (after the completion of the current study), a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across China and the world.9,10 This virus is a group 2b coronavirus, which includes SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs, and"

        "discussion": [
            "This study provided evidence of human\u2013animal interactions in rural communities of southern China that increase the potential for zoonotic disease emergence and suggested opportunities for risk mitigation. Population migration from rural communities to urban areas for employment, as well as the wild animal protection policy changes in China in recent years, have led to a perceived overall reduction in activities such as household animal raising and wildlife trade.30,31 Protective attitudes, knowledge and a supportive social environment for disease prevention were reportedly being developed within the community.31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks.<br/><br/>In spite of these positive changes over the long term, there is little understanding within enrolled participants of the transmission mechanisms and ecology of zoonotic pathogens that currently circulate in animal populations in the region. This is of particular concern in rural communities where close contact with bats and rodents was reported, and zoonotic pathogens have been detected in the widely distributed animal populations with"

With further urbanization, and subsequent increased interactions between human populations and the changing ecosystems, new risk factors for zoonotic disease transmission will likely emerge. This might include changes to the wildlife trade following the temporary ban put in place as a response to the emergence of 2019-nCoV.9,10 Further research to identify the risk factors among different populations will help develop more locally-relevant and fine-tuned risk mitigation strategies and address the social and ecological bias to identifying recommendations for other community settings."

        "Conclusions": [
            "Using a qualitative approach, this study allowed us to explore a variety of risk factors at different individual, community and policy levels to contextualize the risks of zoonotic disease emergence in local communities. The findings provide guidance for future in-depth research on specific risk factors, as well as zoonotic disease control and prevention in southern China and potentially other regions with similar ecological and social contexts."

        "Introduction": [
            "Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases are key contributors to morbidity and mortality in southern China.1,2 This region, considered a \u2018hotspot\u2019 for emerging zoonotic diseases, harbours abundant wildlife while also undergoing land use change and natural resource overexploitation leading to intensified human\u2013 animal interactions that favour the emergence of zoonotic diseases.3 People living in the rural areas of southern China primarily cultivate rice and fruits, raise swine and poultry in households or on small farms,4 but also traditionally hunt wild animals as an alternative income source.5 The mixed landscape has abundant crops, which attracts wild animals into the communities, and livestock rearing is common.6 This brings humans and animals into close contact in dense populations, creating a wildlife\u2013livestock\u2013 human interface for zoonotic disease emergence.7",
            "In recognition of the challenges of emerging infectious diseases after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 caused by a bat-origin coronavirus, the Chinese government established a national real-time hospital-based infectious disease reporting system.1 Likewise, live poultry market interventions were initiated in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in southern China in 2001.8 In December 2019 (after the completion of the current study), a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across China and the world.9,10 This virus is a group 2b coronavirus, which includes SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs, and",
            "H.-Y. Li et al.",
            "its closest relative is a virus identified in a Rhinolophus affinis bat from Yunnan.10,11 Environmental samples positive for 2019nCoV were found in an urban market in Wuhan where some of the earliest known human cases originated.12,13 This likely index site sold predominantly seafood, but is also thought to sell live wildlife at the market, and a temporary ban on the wildlife trade for food has been put in place across China. These efforts in response to SARS, HPAI and 2019-nCoV represent a reactiondriven response to zoonotic disease outbreaks, whereas, apart from the new temporary ban on wildlife trade, only limited preventative measures are currently being enacted in the region to reduce the risk of future zoonotic disease outbreaks.14",
            "However, detailed knowledge of the social and ecological mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence in the region is limited, and therefore cannot yet inform evidence-based policies and practices for targeted surveillance programmes.15 Using a qualitative approach through ethnographic interviews and field observations, this study aimed to understand interactions among humans, animals and ecosystems, to shed light on the zoonotic risks in these presumed high-risk communities and to develop an evidence base for identifying appropriate strategies for zoonotic risk mitigation."
        ],
        "Materials and methods": [
            "The Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces in southern China were selected for this study because of their historical importance in the origin of emerging infectious diseases,16 diverse wildlife population within protected forests17 and intensive wildlife farming and trade activities.18 Three sites in rural areas were identified in each province where our previous research had found numerous bat and rodent populations harbouring viruses with pathogenic potential for humans, at sites close to human communities.19\u201321",
            "Enrolment criteria for participation in an ethnographic interview in this study included: individuals were residents of the target community, aged \u226518 y, with prior contact with live animals directly (e.g. by raising, hunting, trading or slaughtering live animals) or indirectly (e.g. through animals living in or entering dwellings/crops, bat roosts within roofs, animals invading stored food or crops). We targeted a gender breakdown of 35% of participants being female and aimed to have a diverse sample of participants from different age groups and levels of power and influence in the community.",
            "In each province, project investigators provided a two-day training workshop for study staff from local provincial and citylevel Centres for Disease Control and Prevention who spoke the local language and were familiar with the local community. This included a unit on the ethical conduct of human subject research, an in-depth review of the study design and objectives, and comprehensive information on the implementation of observational research, semistructured interviews and notetaking within the context of this study.",
            "Participants were identified through key informants and the snowball sampling method because the population size at selected sites and the people who had high-risk contacts with live animals were difficult to elucidate.22 Starting with the key informants, we asked each participant to suggest people who met the inclusion criteria and who might be interested in participating in this study; we then contacted the referrals for potential participation in our study. Local study staff visited potential participants and provided these individuals with the participant information sheet to introduce them to the study. We aimed to obtain a minimum sample size of 20 participants from each of the three provinces, for a total sample size of over 60 participants. At least two field observations of local markets and household environments were conducted at each study site, for a total of 18 observations at a minimum.",
            "Participation in the study was strictly voluntary. Study staff reviewed the information sheet with potential participants and explained the details of the study. This included the voluntary nature of participation, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study implementation processes (e.g. that the interview would be audio-recorded), potential risks and benefits of participation, results sharing and that they could withdraw their participation at any time. It was also explained that an item as a token would be given as appreciation for their participation, which was identified by the study team and appropriate for the context of the study sites.",
            "After completion of the informed consent process, one-onone semistructured interviews were conducted focusing on the five core themes outlined in the interview guide related to zoonotic disease emergence: human movement, socioeconomics, biosecurity in human environments, human\u2013animal contact and illness, and medical care/treatment and death (Supplementary Data I). All interviews were conducted in the local language and audio-recorded without any identifying information. Confidentiality was maintained by conducting the interviews in a private and secure environment. At the end of the interview, each study participant received a bottle of cooking oil or laundry detergent valued at no more than US$10 as a token of appreciation.",
            "Field observations were conducted by study staff at each study site concurrently. Observations were general and implemented in three settings: (1) local markets where live animals were traded, (2) in and/or around the dwellings of study participants and, if applicable, (3) community centres, to obtain an overview of the study site and the communities, and supplementary data on human-animal interactions and environmental biosecurity. The observed information was narrated by study staff and audio-recorded on site.23",
            "To enhance saturation, efforts were made to include a large variety of people with different backgrounds, to conduct a maximized number of interviews during the 8 wk study period in each province and to cover as many themes and subthemes from the interview guide as possible in each interview.24 All data generated, including notes, audio files, digital transcripts and the interviewer checklist, were coded with an alphanumeric ID to preserve the confidentiality of participants. Paper files were",
            "Data analysis All interviews and observations were transcribed from the local language into Mandarin and translated into English. All transcripts were imported into MAXQDA release 12 statistical software (VERBI Software, Berlin, Germany) for data management and analysis. The analysis process incorporated both deductive and inductive approaches, and followed a process of initial coding, identification of new themes, primary coding and identification and analysis of emerging themes.25 An initial codebook associated with the five core themes of the interview guide was developed a priori. After a close reading of the transcripts, two authors used the initial codebook to independently code two transcripts in their entirety, making notes on emerging themes and specified subthemes. Subsequently, the two authors adapted the codebook and used the modified codebook to code all of the transcripts. During the coding process, the two authors met when any major new themes or concepts emerged to decide on any necessary revisions to the codebook, until no new themes emerged and no new information was obtained from the coding. The final codebook was restructured with five sections: (1) demographics, (2) biosecurity in human environments, (3) human\u2013animal contact, (4) illness, treatment and death and (5) animal taxa; subthemes were defined under each section.",
            "After completion of the coding, a code report was generated from MAXQDA. Internal reliability was assessed by comparing the coded segments from two authors on the same two transcripts to reach a minimum code interaction rate of 80%.26 A saturation grid was built using the \u2018Segment Retrieval\u2019 function in MAXQDA to ensure saturation was reached.27 Coded segments were categorized into protective factors and risk factors based on their known associations with disease transmission, and the analysis was stratified at the individual, community and policy or regulation level.28 At the individual level, both risk and protective factors were analysed in terms of the individuals\u2019 knowledge, attitudes and practices to better understand the risk factors for identifying context-based strategies.29 (Figure 1)."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "This study provided evidence of human\u2013animal interactions in rural communities of southern China that increase the potential for zoonotic disease emergence and suggested opportunities for risk mitigation. Population migration from rural communities to urban areas for employment, as well as the wild animal protection policy changes in China in recent years, have led to a perceived overall reduction in activities such as household animal raising and wildlife trade.30,31 Protective attitudes, knowledge and a supportive social environment for disease prevention were reportedly being developed within the community.31 Existing local preliminary programmes and policies around human and animal health, community development and conservation are considered effective resources to begin or continue developing cost-effective strategies to mitigate zoonotic risks.",
            "In spite of these positive changes over the long term, there is little understanding within enrolled participants of the transmission mechanisms and ecology of zoonotic pathogens that currently circulate in animal populations in the region. This is of particular concern in rural communities where close contact with bats and rodents was reported, and zoonotic pathogens have been detected in the widely distributed animal populations with",

Interviewer: \u2018Is there governmental compensation system if animals damage crops?\u2019 Interviewee: \u2018No, our winner bamboo shoots are eaten by wild boars. Nothing will be left once they come, and they run so fast. But there is no compensation, they sometimes run to the orchard to eat oranges and damage many trees.

            "Enforcement of current wildlife protection policy and continued community infrastructure development appears to significantly reduce high-risk contact between humans, wildlife and livestock. Closer collaboration between local animal and human health authorities within the current epidemic disease prevention programmes will provide educational and training opportunities to promote risk-mitigation knowledge, skills and best practice in local communities. For example, cave monitoring and management is a low-cost and efficient method to help restrict human activities (e.g. recreation and mining) that lead to contact with bats in caves. This is of particular importance given the emergence of 2019-nCoV, which appears likely to be a bat-origin coronavirus.10,11",
            "As the first qualitative study in southern China to assess risk factors for zoonotic disease emergence, our scope was limited by current knowledge, only allowing us to focus on known presumed risk factors. With further urbanization, and subsequent increased interactions between human populations and the changing ecosystems, new risk factors for zoonotic disease transmission will likely emerge. This might include changes to the wildlife trade following the temporary ban put in place as a response to the emergence of 2019-nCoV.9,10 Further research to identify the risk factors among different populations will help develop more locally-relevant and fine-tuned risk mitigation strategies and address the social and ecological bias to identifying recommendations for other community settings."
