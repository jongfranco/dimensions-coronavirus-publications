        "abstract": "Last December 2019, a new virus, named novel Coronavirus (COVID\u20102019) causing many cases of severe pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China. The virus knowledge is limited and especially about COVID\u20102019 pathogenesis. The Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID\u20102019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus. For selective pressure analysis fast\u2010unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) was used. Homology modelling has been performed by SwissModel and HHPred servers. The presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus ORF1ab non structural protein 2 (nsp2) and nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] was tested by TMHMM, MEMSAT, and MEMPACK tools. Three\u2010 dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL. FUBAR analysis revealed the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure (P < .05). Position 723 in the COVID\u20102019 has a serine instead a glycine residue, while at aminoacidic position 1010 a proline instead an isoleucine. Significant (P < .05) pervasive negative selection in 2416 sites (55%) was found. The positive selective pressure could account for some clinical features of this virus compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Bat SARS\u2010like CoV. The stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome\u2010associated\u2010protein\u2010like domain of the nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] protein could account for COVID\u20102019 high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating COVID\u20102019 from SARS. These data could be helpful for further investigation aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets or vaccine strategy, especially in the actual moment when the epidemic is ongoing and the scientific community is trying to enrich knowledge about this new viral pathogen.",

The emergence of such a novel, highly virulent pathogen warrants rapid investigation of its etiology and evolution to control the impact on human health.",
            "Knowledge about COVID\u20102019 is still incomplete, many questions have raised and many answers are needed first of all regarding its pathogenicity, its ability to change, how many people will get sick from each infected person, the so\u2010called R0 and when infection will be preventable or treatable.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] In the last period where many researchers are intensively studying the mechanism of COVID\u20102019 replication, pathogenicity, and therapeutic strategies, the present study has been realized. The aim was to provide information about how quickly the virus could potentially increase its genetic variability, with important implications for disease progression and drug or vaccine development. At this aim the Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID\u20102019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus and their influence on viral ability to infect human host promoting epidemic spread.",
            "The ORF1ab of 15 COVID\u20102019 sequences have been downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/genbank/) databanks. A dataset has been built using the five sequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and five sequences from Bat SARS\u2010like virus sharing the highest sequence similarity to the COVID\u20102019 sequence (Table 1). The pairwise percentage of similarity has been calculated using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi); duplicated sequences have been removed from the dataset. The 25 sequences have been aligned using a multiple sequence alignment multiple alignment using fast fourier transform online tool[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] and manually edited using Bioedit program v7.0.5.5",
            "The selective pressure analysis was focused on the polyprotein ORF1ab because it differs from the most similar bat Coronavirus (QHR63299) for only 103 amino acid residues, 64 of them are conservative changes. In particular, non structural protein 2 (nsp2) differs from bat Coronavirus for 11 residues while nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] for 64 residues of which 44 are conservative changes.",
            "Adaptive Evolution Server (http://www.datamonkey.org/) was used to find eventual sites under of positive or negative selection pressure. At this purpose the following tests has been used: fast\u2010 unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] These tests allowed to infer the site\u2010specific pervasive selection, the episodic diversifying selection across the region of interest and to identify episodic selection at individual sites.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Statistically significant positive or negative selection was based on P < .05.",
            "Homology modelling has been attempted with SwissModel[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] and HHPred[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] servers.

        ],
        "3 | RESULTS": [
            "Regarding the FUBAR analysis performed on the ORF1ab region, the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure have been found (P < .05), in particular: on the amino acidic position 501 the COVID\u20102019 has a glutamine residue, the Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus has a threonine residue and the SARS virus has an alanine residue. At position 723 in the COVID\u20102019 there is a serine residue while the Bat SARS\u2010like virus and the SARS virus have a glycine residue. On the aminoacidic position 1010, the COVID\u20102019 has a proline residue, the Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus has a histidine residue and the SARS virus has an isoleucine residue. Significant (P < .05) pervasive negative selection in 2416 sites (55%) has been evidenced and confirmed by FUBAR analysis.",
            "To map the structural variability of the ORF1ab region of the virus and its sites under selection pressure, homology modelling has been attempted. Unfortunately, neither SwissModel nor HHPred found suitable templates for the amino acid region containing the sites under selective pressure. For that reason, the corresponding models available on the I\u2010Tasser web site has been used. Moreover, some regions of the nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] proteins structurally homologous to other known viral proteins have been identified through HHpred analysis and have been mapped within the ORF1ab nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] sequences (Figure 1).",
            "The results of the analysis suggest the presence of a segment within the nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and the nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] regions that has no evident homologous structures. In an attempt to structurally characterize as far as possible these regions, TMHMM, MEMSAT, and MEMPACK analyses have been utilized and have shown the presence of several potential trans\u2010membrane helices (Figure 1). In particular, our transmembrane helices were predicted by MEMSAT in nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] while six helices were predicted by MEMSTA and TMHMM in nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] (Figure 1).",
            "Referring to the amino acids under positive selective pressure found using the FUBAR analysis: the amino acid in position 501 (position 321 of the nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] protein), the corresponding site in the Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus has an apolar amino acid while the SARS and COVID\u20102019 has a polar amino acid. It can be speculated, that due to its side chain length, polarity, and potential to form H\u2010bonds the glutamine amino acid may confer higher stability to the protein. The mutations fall within the protein nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] on the region homologous to the endosome\u2010associated protein similar to the avian infectious bronchitis virus (PDB 3ld1) that plays a key\u2010role in the viral",
            "As for the residue in position 723 (543 in the nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] protein), the COVID\u20102019 sequence displays a Ser replacing for Gly in Bat SARS\u2010 like and SARS coronaviruses. In this case, it may be argued that this substitution could increase local stiffness of the polypeptide chain both for steric effect (at variance with Ser, Gly has no side chain) and for ability of Ser side chain to form H\u2010bonds. Moreover, Ser can act as a nucleophile in determined structural environments, such as those of enzyme active sites. Within the I\u2010Tasser model, this position is predicted to have a low solvent accessibility (Figure 2).",
            "Regarding the amino acid in position 1010 (corresponding to position 192 of the nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] protein), the homologous region of the Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus and SARS virus have a polar and an apolar amino acid, respectively, while the COVID\u20102019 has proline. In this case, it may be speculated that due to the steric bulge and stiffness of the proline, the molecular structure of the COVID\u20102019 may undergo a local conformation perturbation compared with the proteins of the other two viruses. In Nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], the mutation falls near the protein similar to a phosphatase present also in the SARS coronavirus (PDB code 2acf) playing a key\u2010role in the replication process of the virus in infected cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] (Figure 3). In the I\u2010Tasser model, the position is partially accessible to the solvent. It should be emphasized that all these considerations are speculative and they need to be substantiated by the availability of the experimental crystallographic structure of the corresponding proteins."
