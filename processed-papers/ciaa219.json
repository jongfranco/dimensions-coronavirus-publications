        "abstract": "We called single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) for all the 84 2019-nCov genomes in GISAID using MN908947 as the reference. Genomes with same SNVs are grouped into a haplotype (shown as a pie chart node in Fig. 1, see Tab. S1 for the accessions), then the network is constructed using the median join [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] method in popART [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. We found the 2019-nCoV haplotype network has obvious characteristics of single origin from haplotype hap_011: first, the network is star-like, centralized on the haplotype hap_011; second, hap_011 has the largest sample size and majority of the samples are from Hubei province\u2014where outbreak originated (Tab. S1); third, most of satellite haplotypes are also from Hubei (Fig. 1); fourth, the average collection dates of hap_011 (has 0 mutation relative to MN908947) is earlier than all other mutation groups (Fig. S1). The single origin of 2019-nCov indicates a persistent animal to human transmission is unlikely, otherwise, multiple nodes with above characteristics should be observed.",

Each haplotype node is represent by a pie chart, with size indicating the sample size (Tab S1), and colors indicating collection regions. Each hatch mark along the edge corresponds to a mutation between the two haplotypes linked. The mutation notation along a loop edge shows the position and nucleotide status change between the two haplotypes linked.",
