        "abstract": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), first identified in 2012, is a swine enteropathogen now found in many countries. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, a core component of PDCoV, is essential for virus replication and is a significant candidate in the development of diagnostics for PDCoV. In this study, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated and tested for reactivity with three truncations of the full protein (N1, N2, N3) that contained partial overlaps; of the five monoclonals chosen tested, each reacted with only the N3 truncation. The antibody designated 4E88 had highest binding affinity with the N protein and was chosen for in-depth examination. The 4E88 epitope was located to amino acids 308-AKPKQQKKPKK-318 by testing the 4E88 monoclonal for reactivity with a series of N3 truncations, then the minimal epitope, 309-KPKQQKKPK-317 (designated EP-4E88), was pinpointed by testing the 4E88 monoclonal for reactivity with a series of synthetic peptides of this region. Homology analysis showed that the EP-4E88 sequence is highly conserved among PDCoV strains, and also shares high similarity with sparrow coronavirus (HKU17), Asian leopard cat coronavirus (ALCCoV), quail coronavirus (UAE-HKU30), and sparrow deltacoronavirus (SpDCoV). Of note, the PDCoV EP-4E88 sequence shared very low similarity (&lt;22.2%) with other porcine coronaviruses (PEDV, TGEV, PRCV, SADS-CoV, PHEV), demonstrating that it is an epitope that can be used for distinguishing PDCoV and other porcine coronavirus. 3D structural analysis revealed that amino acids of EP-4E88 were in close proximity and may be exposed on the surface of the N protein.",

            "PDCoV, a novel swine enteropathogen, has spread quickly since first discovered in 2012 in Hong Kong. Its distribution is now nearly worldwide and is causing increasing economic losses to commercial pig industries. Co-infections of PDCoV and other enteric viruses complicates diagnosis and leads to increased morbidity and mortality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. A discriminate diagnostic tool would be invaluable for efforts in the control of PDCoV and similar viruses.<br/><br/>Coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is one of the most abundant viral proteins and is the major antigen recognized by convalescent antisera [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Compared with other coronavirus proteins, the N protein is a preferred candidate for serological diagnostics because it is abundant and highly conserved among coronavirus species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Leung et al found [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] that in patients with SARS, IgG most frequently dominated the antibody response and predominantly targeted the viral nucleocapsid. With respect to PDCoV, the S and N proteins have frequently been the focus for the development of diagnostics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. The CoV spike protein however, varies due to mutation to a much greater extent that does the N protein, the result of this variation is a lack of diagnostic accuracy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]."

Virus and Cells<br/><br/>ST cells (ATCC CRL-1746), Sp2/0-Ag14 (ATCC CRL-1581) cells and Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were maintained at 37 \u25e6C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (PAN-Biotech, Aigenbach, Germany) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Solarbio, Beijing, China). The PDCoV strain CHN-SC2015 (GenBank accession No.MK355396), PEDV-CV777 strain (GenBank accession No AF353511.1), TGEV-H strain was preserved by the Laboratory of Research Center of Swine Disease in Sichuan Agricultural University.

        "conclusions": [
            "In this study, five monoclonals of PDCoV N protein were produced. Of the five monoclonals, mAB 4E88 had highest binding affinity with the N protein and was chosen for identifying epitope. EP-4E88 (aa309-KPKQQKKPK-317) was the minimal epitope which recognized by mAb 4E88. Homology analysis showed that the EP-4E88 sequence is highly conserved among PDCoV strains and several deltacoronavirus but shared very low similarity with other porcine coronaviruses. Therefore, EP-4E88 lays a good foundation for applied research associated with PDCoV diagnosis.<br/><br/>Author Contributions: J.F., R.C. made major contributions to this work; X.H. and S.C. designed the study and revised the manuscript; J.H., Y.Z., H.Q.

Among these is porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), originally discovered from fecal samples of pigs in Hong Kong in 2012 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Since then, PDCoV has been reported in multiple states of the United States and Canada [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], South Korea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], mainland China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and Thailand [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] causing economic losses to each country\u2019s swine industry. Clinically, Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is indistinguishable from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), both Alphacoronaviruses, it is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in piglets, and histopathological lesions typical of atrophic enteritis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. The clinical and epidemiological similarities between PDCoV and other porcine intestinal",
            "Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 648; doi:10.3390/ijms21020648 www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms",
            "Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 648 pathogenic coronaviruses make diagnosis and treatment of these viruses a challenge, highlighting the need for discriminating diagnostic methods [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].",
            "PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a 25 kb genome [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In the genome opening reading frames(ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b account for two-thirds of its genome, which encode two polymerase proteins, pp1a and pp1ab [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The last one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S protein), envelope (E protein), membrane (M protein), nucleocapsid (N protein), and three accessory proteins (NS6 and NS7/NS7a) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. NS7 ORF is included into N gene sequence. Moreover, NS7a is contained into NS7 ORF [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. The N protein is a phosphoprotein and binds to RNA genome, which supplies a structural basis to the helical nucleocapsid [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. The common characteristics for all CoVs N proteins are high expression levels early in the infection and high anti-N antibody levels. N protein also owns multiple functions in pathogenesis, viral replication, and immune system interference [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. These characteristics make the N protein an ideal target for development of serological methods based on purified protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] or antigenic epitopes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>].",
            "PDCoV N protein is highly conserved among PDCoV strains but had low sequence identity with other porcine coronavirus, such as PEDV, TGEV, and PRCV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Although CoV N proteins have low sequence identity, all share the same domain and structure organization [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. For diagnosis of PDCoV, serological assays based on N protein, such as indirect ELISA and fluorescent microsphere immunoassay, have proven to be highly sensitive [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Monoclonal antibodies of PDCoV N protein have also proven useful in fluorescent antibody and immunohistochemistry staining methods for identification of PDCoV-infected cells or intestinal tissues [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. However, the cross-reactivity between porcine coronaviruses in these assays makes accurate diagnoses difficult [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>], thus development of discriminate diagnostic assays for PDCoV is essential.",
            "In this study, the N protein of PDCoV was expressed in E. coli, purified, then used to produce mouse monoclonal antibodies. The epitope (EP-4E88/309-KPKQQKKPK-317) of the antibody with the highest N protein binding affinity was extensively investigated. Sequence alignment analysis revealed that the sequence of EP-4E88 is highly conserved among porcine deltacoronavirus strains, but has very low sequence similarity to other porcine coronavirus (PEDV, TGEV, PRCV, SADS-CoV, PHEV). Among them, TGEV, PRCV N protein are identical, because PRCV is a S gene deletion of TGEV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Besides, SADS-CoV also known as swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] and porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. The results of I-TASSER server for 3D structure prediction showed that amino acids of EP-4E88 was in close proximity and may be exposed on the surface of the N protein. Our findings on this PDCoV N protein epitope added insight for developing epitope-associated diagnostics and vaccines."

        "3. Discussion": [
            "PDCoV, a novel swine enteropathogen, has spread quickly since first discovered in 2012 in Hong Kong. Its distribution is now nearly worldwide and is causing increasing economic losses to commercial pig industries. Co-infections of PDCoV and other enteric viruses complicates diagnosis and leads to increased morbidity and mortality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. A discriminate diagnostic tool would be invaluable for efforts in the control of PDCoV and similar viruses.",
            "Coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is one of the most abundant viral proteins and is the major antigen recognized by convalescent antisera [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Compared with other coronavirus proteins, the N protein is a preferred candidate for serological diagnostics because it is abundant and highly conserved among coronavirus species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Leung et al found [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] that in patients with SARS, IgG most frequently dominated the antibody response and predominantly targeted the viral nucleocapsid. With respect to PDCoV, the S and N proteins have frequently been the focus for the development of diagnostics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. The CoV spike protein however, varies due to mutation to a much greater extent that does the N protein, the result of this variation is a lack of diagnostic accuracy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>].",
            "In this study, monoclonal antibodies were produced against purified recombinant N-protein and their epitopes investigated. The five antibodies we tested, all recognized the 122 C-terminal amino acids of the N-protein (aa 221-341), indicating that this section contains the main antigenic epitope of N protein. IEDB (Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource) prediction analysis software (http://www.iedb.org/) also proved our point, the results indicated that three epitopes located at the C-terminal of the N-protein sequence, and the largest of 10 predicted epitopes is in amino acids 221-342, this fragment we termed N3. B-cell epitopes are classified as linear or conformational, though it has been reported that 90% of B cell-recognizing epitopes are conformational epitopes, this is due to most of the B-cells epitopes can form conformation in the three dimensional structure, the antigen internalizing process and antigen recognizing ability [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. To determine whether our monoclonals recognized conformational epitopes, the N protein was denatured and then tested for reactivity with the mAbs by dot-blot. One mAb (6A5) did not react with the denatured N protein, so we speculated that it recognizes a conformational epitope, the remaining mAbs did react with the denatured N protein so we speculated that these recognize linear epitopes. One mAb (4E88) from our panel was selected for further study of the antigenic epitope of N protein; we chose this antibody because it had the highest reactivity with N-protein in ELISA and dot blot, as well as in PDCoV-infected cells. Moreover, the dominant epitope of the N protein has a greater potential use for early diagnostics than the others.",
            "Identification of PDCoV B-cell epitopes is fundamental for the development of epitope-based diagnostic tools, vaccines, and therapeutic antibodies. Approaches for epitope identification are structural and functional. Structural methods include X-ray crystallography, which can precisely locate the epitope position but it is limited to small soluble proteins, the method is also time consuming and costly, together these impede its widespread use [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. Functional methods are used to detect the binding activity of antibody with antigen fragments, synthetic peptides or recombinant antigens, and have the advantage of being simpler to conduct [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. Here, the epitope region recognized by 4E88 (308-AKPKQQKKPKK-318 aa) was determined by serially truncating the N3 portion of the N-protein. From there a series of peptides were synthesized and used as antigen in ELISA and dot blot assays, thus we determined that 309-KPKQQKKPK-317 was the minimal epitope.",
            "Woo et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] found that avian and mammalian deltacoronaviruses share similar genome characteristics and structure, and that avian coronaviruses are the gene source of gamma- and deltacoronaviruses. In our study alignment analysis revealed that the sequence of epitope 4E88 is highly conserved among PDCoV strains; the sequence similarity was also extremely high with Sparrow coronavirus (HKU17), Asian leopard cat coronavirus (ALCCoV), Quail coronavirus (UAE-HKU30), and Sparrow deltacoronavirus (SpDCoV). PDCoV may come from a host jumps event between mammals and birds [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>], also supporting this view is genome analysis showing that PDCoV shares a close relationship with HKU17 (96.8% of sequence identity in N), HKU30 (90.9% of sequence identity in N), and SpDCoV (95.3% of sequence identity in N) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. The shared sequence at position",
            "309-317aa (epitope 4E88) among PDCoV, HKU17, ALCCoV, HKU30, and SpDCoV may contribute to the understanding of the evolutionary relationship between birds and mammals. Similar phenomenon was also found in other virus. Li et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>] found a shared epitope, EXE/DPPFG, among six flaviviruses and verified the cross-reactivity by positive sera detection. Chen et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>] found that PDCoV N gene-based PCR cross-reacts with SpDCoV because of their relatively conserved regions. The relationship between PDCoV and other animal-originated deltacoronavirus needs further exploration and whether PDCoV EP-4E88 cross-reacts with HKU17, ALCCoV, HKU30, or SpDCoV should be analyzed using two-way serum cross-reactivity.",
            "To date, six porcine coronavirus diseases (PEDV, TGEV, PRCV, SADS-CoV, PHEV, PDCoV) have been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. Because they present with similar clinical symptoms, diagnosis is a challenge, a sensitive and discriminate serologic method is clearly needed. The PDCoV epitope, 4E88 (aa 309-KPKQQKKPK-317), found in this study shares very low sequence similarity (<22.2%) with other swine coronavirus (Figure 6C), such as PEDV (aa 309-NKRETTLQQ-317) and TGEV (aa 309-SRSKSAERS-317), PHEV (aa 309-QKNGQVEND-317), PRCV (aa 309-SRSKSAERS-317), SADS-CoV (aa 309-SQSQDLNA-317) indicating the EP-4E88 is unique to PDCoV and could be used to distinguish PDCoV and from other swine coronaviruses. Cross-reactivity among swine coronaviruses has been reported and is usually associated with the epitope of N protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]. Lin et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] observed that one-way cross-reaction between TGEV Miller hyperimmune pig antisera and various PEDV strains with the TGEV Miller N protein mAb (14G9.3C) was based on an N protein epitope. Xie et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] found two N-terminal epitopes (58-RWRMRRGERIE-68 and 78-LGTGPHAD-85) of the PEDV N protein contribute to the cross-reaction between PEDV and TGEV. Ma et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] found that N protein is responsible for two-way cross-reactivity between PEDV and PDCoV; four regions (47-GYW-49, 67-FYYTGTGPRGNLKY-82, 194-PKG-197, and 329-EWD-332) are highly conserved and likely account for the cross-reaction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>].",
            "To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify the PDCoV N-protein antigenic epitope EP-4E88 (aa 309-NKRETTLQQ-317). It is a linear B-cell epitope and highly conserved among PDCoV strains and other porcine coronaviruses, EP-4E88 also shares high sequence identity with four non-swine deltacoronavirus. Our findings provide valuable insight into the evolutionary and serological relationship among PDCoV and non-swine deltacoronavirus, and for the development of PDCoV epitope-associated diagnostics and vaccine design."
