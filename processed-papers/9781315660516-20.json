            "In Chapter 20, Jooho Lee and M. Jae Moon survey the evolution of South Korean e-government, which has been recognized as a showcase for the effective application of ICT in the public sector. Lee and Moon provide a brief history of Korea\u2019s e-government journey that includes its visions, strategies, and major milestones. In order to systematically understand and assess the practices of Korean e-government, the discussion of Korean e-government research is organized around e-government adoption and its impacts. The drivers of Korean e-government adoption are discussed in terms of the roles of environmental, organizational, and individual factors. Lee and Moon also analyze administrative, economic, political, and social impacts of e-government in South Korea. The future of Korean e-government is discussed by focusing on insights gained from smart e-governance and open e-governance initiatives."
