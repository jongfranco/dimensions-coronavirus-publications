        "abstract": "Aims Carotid intima\u2013media thickness (CIMT) is an independent predictor of vascular events in the general population. Currently, little is known about the relationship between CIMT and new vascular events in patients with manifest arterial disease. We aimed to assess the strength of this relationship. Methods and results The study was performed in the first consecutive 2374 patients with manifest arterial disease enrolled in the cohort study SMART (Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease), a cohort study among patients with manifest arterial disease or cardiovascular risk factors. Common CIMT was measured at baseline in both carotid arteries. Vascular events were vascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke, whichever occurred first. Adjusted for age and sex, an increase in common CIMT of 1 SD (0.32 mm) was associated with the occurrence of vascular events [hazard ratio (HR) 1.18; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.04\u20131.32]. Increasing CIMT was most strongly related to ischaemic stroke incidence (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.16\u20131.59). Results were similar in the 2177 patients without large common carotid plaques (CIMT ,2 mm at all measurements sites). The findings were similar after additional adjustment for risk factors of CIMT and vascular risk. Conclusion Common CIMT is associated with the occurrence of new vascular events, mostly for ischaemic stroke, in patients with manifest arterial disease. This relation does not appear to depend on the presence of plaques.",

            "In conclusion, these findings from the SMART study support the view that increased common CIMT is related to an increased risk of vascular death and vascular events in patients with manifest arterial disease. This relation does not appear to depend on the extent to which CIMT thickness is determined by the presence of plaques."

            "Carotid intima\u2013media thickness (CIMT) is an independent predictor of vascular events in the general population. Currently, little is known about the relationship between CIMT and new vascular events in patients with manifest arterial disease. We aimed to assess the strength of this relationship. Methods and results The study was performed in the first consecutive 2374 patients with manifest arterial disease enrolled in the cohort study SMART (Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease), a cohort study among patients with manifest arterial disease or cardiovascular risk factors. Common CIMT was measured at baseline in both carotid arteries. Vascular events were vascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke, whichever occurred first. Adjusted for age and sex, an increase in common CIMT of 1 SD (0.32 mm) was associated with the occurrence of vascular events [hazard ratio (HR) 1.18; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.04\u20131.32]. Increasing CIMT was most strongly related to ischaemic stroke incidence (HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.16\u20131.59). Results were similar in the 2177 patients without large common carotid plaques (CIMT ,2 mm at all measurements sites). The findings were similar after additional adjustment for risk factors of CIMT and vascular risk. Conclusion Common CIMT is associated with the occurrence of new vascular events, mostly for ischaemic stroke, in patients with manifest arterial disease. This relation does not appear to depend on the presence of plaques."

The common CIMT ranged from 0.36 to 4.52 mm, with a mean of 0.95 mm (SD 0.32 mm). Table 4 shows the coincidence of manifestations of arterial disease in individual patients at baseline. In 424 patients, two manifestations of arterial disease were present, 69 patients had three and eight patients had four manifestations.<br/><br/>During a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range: 0.1\u20136.5 years), 225 patients experienced a new vascular event, of whom 125 died of a vascular cause. In Table 5, the HRs of different vascular events are given for 1 SD increase in common CIMT. Adjusted for age and sex, increased CIMT was related to an increased risk of any vascular event (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.32). When the vascular events were separated into ischaemic stroke and coronary ischaemic events, the relative risk of stroke [1.35 (1.16\u20131.59)] associated with 1 SD increase in CIMT appeared higher than that of ischaemic coronary events [1.19 (CI 1.02\u20131.38)]. After adjustment for vascular risk factors for increased CIMT and cardiovascular risk, the strengths of the relations attenuated slightly. Additionally, in Table 5, the relation of CIMT with vascular events is given for the 2177 patients with a CIMT ,2 mm at all six measurement sites. The relation between CIMT and stroke [46 events, HR 2.07 (1.38\u20133.11)] appeared stronger relative to the findings in the total population, whereas the association with vascular death and other vascular events was not materially altered.

            "The results of our study show that in patients with manifest vascular disease, increased common CIMT is associated with a higher risk of vascular events (Table 5). The relative risk for ischaemic stroke apparently is greater than that of other vascular events. The associations are largely independent of age and sex and are present in patients with previous CAD, PAD, and stroke or TIA.<br/><br/>Increased CIMT reflects the severity of arterial damage brought about by classical vascular risk factors.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] CIMT thus may be considered an intermediate in the causal pathway between vascular risk factors and clinical manifest arterial disease. Therefore, these classical risk factors are no confounders and should not be controlled for in the analysis. Nevertheless, when the main interest is to assess whether the novel risk factors are related to new vascular events independent of these classical risk factors, one may want to additionally adjust for these factors."

The total intima\u2013media surface of this selected area was calculated automatically. The mean CIMT of the six measurements in each patient was calculated.

A potential explanation is a stronger relation of CIMT with small vessel disease (causing approximately one-quarter of all strokes),[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>] than with large vessel disease (the cause of CAD).

The relation of CIMT with ischaemic stroke was, if anything, even stronger after exclusion of patients with a common carotid plaque, although the number of strokes was relatively small (46). Because exact plaque measurements were not available, patients with a small plaque may still be present among the patients with a ,2 mm CIMT. As exclusion of the large plaques did not result in a decrease in risk associated with increased CIMT and the risk appeared to be continuous across the distribution of thickness, plaques are not likely to largely explain the relation between CIMT and vascular risk.",

However, there were two remarkable differences. First, the relation of CIMT with vascular death was stronger when studied in strata of manifestations of arterial disease than in the population as a whole. This may be explained by the fact that patients with more than one clinical manifestation of arterial disease fell into more categories and at the same time were at a higher risk of vascular death. Secondly, although CIs are overlapping, in patients with PAD, the risk of coronary ischaemic events appeared higher [HR 1.39 (1.14\u20131.70)] than in the overall population.

The use of CIMT as a tool to enhance risk differentiation, awaits further evaluation.",
            "In conclusion, these findings from the SMART study support the view that increased common CIMT is related to an increased risk of vascular death and vascular events in patients with manifest arterial disease. This relation does not appear to depend on the extent to which CIMT thickness is determined by the presence of plaques."
