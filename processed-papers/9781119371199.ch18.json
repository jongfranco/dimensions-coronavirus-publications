        "abstract": "Colibacillosis refers to any localized or systemic infection caused entirely or partly by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli. Syndromes of disease include colisepticemia, hemorrhagic septicemia, coligranuloma, airsacculitis, swollen\u2010head syndrome, venereal colibacillosis, coliform cellulitis, peritonitis, salpingitis, orchitis, osteomyelitis/synovitis, panophthalmitis, omphalitis/yolk sac infection, and enteritis. This chapter offers detailed coverage of the history, etiology, pathobiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and intervention strategies of campylobacteriosis. The various forms of colibacillosis are considered to be the most common infectious bacterial disease of broiler chickens and turkeys. Diagnosis is based on isolation and identification of E. coli from lesions typical of colibacillosis. Isolation of the organism from visceral organs of birds undergoing decomposition must be interpreted cautiously as E. coli rapidly spreads from the intestinal tract into surrounding tissues of dead birds. Interventions for colibacillosis include hatchery and flock management practices, with emphasis on air quality, temperature, litter and housing environment, and sanitation.",
