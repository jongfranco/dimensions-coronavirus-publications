            "This is the third coronavirus that has emerged in the past 2 decades, causing multinational outbreaks and carrying substantial morbidity and mortality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. While there are distinct features for each of these outbreaks (Table 1), the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak brings to intensivists and the critical care community similar challenges to what was faced with SARS and MERS",
            "The biggest challenge to intensivists at this point is when to suspect COVID-19. At present, limited specific data are available on the clinical characteristics and natural course of critically ill patients with COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. In a study of 138 patients with 2019 nCoV, 36/138 were admitted to the ICU and they were significantly older than patients who did not require ICU admission (median of 66 compared to 51 years) and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (72% compared to 37%). In the ICU, 11% of patients received high-flow nasal cannula and 15 (44%) received noninvasive ventilation. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 17 patients (47%), 4 of whom received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as rescue therapy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Interestingly, 44% were reported to develop arrhythmias in the ICU. In another study of 52 critically ill adult patients, the mean age was 60 years, with 40% of patients had at least one chronic illness. Of these patients, 67% developed ARDS, 29% acute kidney injury, 23% cardiac injury and 29% liver dysfunction. Invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation was required in 71% of patients. By day 28, 62% of patients died [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. The majority of the severely ill cases have been in adults, with very limited data on pediatric infections with severe illness thus far."
