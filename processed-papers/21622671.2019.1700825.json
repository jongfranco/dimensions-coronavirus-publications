        "abstract": "This paper investigates infectious disease mismanagement as a way of understanding the mixture of neoliberal and illiberal governance in public health. While acknowledging the significant role of neoliberalization in public health, we call for tracing geographies of illiberalism in relation to various actors, and through various scales and processes of governance, such as private power and state absence. Through a case study of the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) throughout South Korea in 2015, this research demonstrates how neoliberal transformations in public health and illiberal practices of disease management allowed a severe outbreak of MERS, while being of benefit to a few private actors. In the MERS response, state absence via non-response such as cover-ups and censorship exacerbated state violence such as drastic quarantine and othering. Further, the South Korean government\u2013chaebol nexus has profoundly privatized both disease management and public health, as well as intensified the responsibilization of individuals. By explaining how illiberal and neoliberal processes and particular actors came to matter in politics of infectious diseases in Korea, this paper contributes to the sociopolitical understanding of infectious diseases and public health in a mixture of authoritarianism and neoliberalism.

            "This paper investigates infectious disease mismanagement as a way of understanding the mixture of neoliberal and illiberal governance in public health. While acknowledging the significant role of neoliberalization in public health, we call for tracing geographies of illiberalism in relation to various actors, and through various scales and processes of governance, such as private power and state absence. Through a case study of the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) throughout South Korea in 2015, this research demonstrates how neoliberal transformations in public health and illiberal practices of disease management allowed a severe outbreak of MERS, while being of benefit to a few private actors. In the MERS response, state absence via non-response such as cover-ups and censorship exacerbated state violence such as drastic quarantine and othering. Further, the South Korean government\u2013chaebol nexus has profoundly privatized both disease management and public health, as well as intensified the responsibilization of individuals. By explaining how illiberal and neoliberal processes and particular actors came to matter in politics of infectious diseases in Korea, this paper contributes to the sociopolitical understanding of infectious diseases and public health in a mixture of authoritarianism and neoliberalism. KEYWORDS infectious diseases; illiberalism; authoritarian neoliberalism; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); concealment; quarantine; chaebols; Samsung",
            "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is a recently evolved viral respiratory disease caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (WHO, 2015a). The virus passes via close contact and MERS has represented a relatively low risk globally, that is, less easily spread than other emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) categorized as pandemics by the World Health Organization (WHO). Yet, the MERS crisis in South Korea in 2015 deserves attention for what it shows about public health governance and the politics of infectious diseases."

            "According to Article 36(3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, \u2018[i]n terms of public health, all citizens are protected by the government\u2019 (The Constitution of the Republic of Korea, 1987). Indeed, disease management has been regarded as an important role of authorities even in pre-modern times.

In this case, with attention to the particular context of the outbreak, we see how the Korean state\u2013chaebol nexus enabled or encouraged harm through state absence in some spaces, but once the epidemic was public, there was a clear increase in state violence. Nevertheless, this is not authoritarianism: the mayor of Seoul, and much of the media, criticized the government and demanded other kinds of policies.",
            "In closing, we find two avenues where we can make further contributions. First, disease mismanagement and public health crises continue to be important phenomena from which we can learn about illiberal governance, processes and practices. During the past 35 years, nearly onethird of the world\u2019s deaths were caused by EIDs, and mortality and morbidity related to infectious diseases worldwide are increasing (Global Burden of Disease 2016; Causes of Death Collaborators, 2017) \u2013 we are witnessing \u2018an epidemic of epidemics\u2019 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cElbe_2018_a\" href=\"#rElbe_2018_a\">Elbe, 2018</a>, p. 1). Illiberal practices operate in an overall hegemonic international system, and South Korea is not the only illiberal/ neoliberal venue that turns to austerity and coercion in the face of infectious diseases. We need still more research on disease response and public health attending to the actually existing illiberal and neoliberal processes in disease responses in various contexts. Examining such processes will continue to reveal the importance of shifting relations among variously scaled agencies and bodies, of careful conceptualization of practices and the state, and of mutually constitutive spatialities amid the growing scholarly research on global public health. We still need greater attention to the roles of private or commercial interests in urban, national and global health governance.",
            "Second, the South Korean case exemplifies phenomena that cannot be explained solely by neoliberalism nor illiberalism. To pursue these inquiries further, we need more interdisciplinary conversations. The literature on illiberalism first developed by social scientists and anthropologists recognizes ill- and neo-liberal practices in supposedly liberal states. Geographical perspectives can broaden the illiberalism scholarship with a critique of the unitary state and of state-centrism, as well as by problematizing the dichotomies of liberal/illiberal and the imaginative geographies deploying that dichotomy. This paper also complements the argument regarding variegated neoliberalism (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBrenner_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rBrenner_et+al_2010_a\">Brenner, Peck, & Theodore, 2010</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPeck_2013_a\" href=\"#rPeck_2013_a\">Peck, 2013</a>), and highlights the need for scrutinizing more pluralist usages of politics and governance (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAgnew_2013_a\" href=\"#rAgnew_2013_a\">Agnew, 2013</a>) regarding public health."

        "In the case of the MERS epidemic in South Korea, we aim to show how socially and politically constructed pathways of ill-liberal management of EIDs led not only to a severe outbreak but also to other harmful outcomes for many people, and benefits for a select few",
        "We argue that we should regard these spaces as sites of calculated state absence, not necessarily as part of a sequential roll-back then roll-out process, because there may be many policies already in place when neoliberalization is implemented",
