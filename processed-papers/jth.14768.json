            "Since December 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) cases emerged in Wuhan, China, then the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was confirmed as the cause of the NCP [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].

In this study, the coagulation parameters of consecutive NCP cases in our hospital were showed, the difference between survivors and non-survivors were investigated.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). The diagnosis of NCP was according to World Health Organization interim guidance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and confirmed by RNA detection of the 2019-nCoV in clinical laboratory of Tongji hospital. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 13, 2020.",
            "The samples for coagulation tests were collected on admission and during the hospital stay, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), antithrombin activity (AT), fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product (FDP) and D-dimer were detected using a STA-R MAX coagulation analyzer and original reagents (Diagnostica Stago, Saint-Denis, France).",
            "Between survivors and non-survivors, normally and abnormally distributed quantitative variables were compared using the Student\u2019s t-test and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test, respectively. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test. The results were given as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median ((interquartile range), or number (percentage), wherever appropriate. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results and Discussion There were 183 patients (85 females and 98 males) with NCP enrolled into the study, and these patients had complete clinical information and the laboratory data required for this study. The mean age at disease onset was 54.1 years (range, 14 - 94 years). 75 (41.0%) patients had chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory system disease, malignant tumour, chronic liver and kidney disease, et al All patients received antiviral and supportive therapies after diagnosis. By the end of February 13, 78 (42.6%) patients had been discharged and 21 (11.5%) patients had died, the rest 84 (45.9%) patients remains hospitalized in stable condition.",
            "The coagulation parameters on admission between survivors and non-survivors were compared (Table 1). Based on our detection system, the reportable range of D-dimer and FDP were 0.22~21.00 ug/mL and 4.0~150.0 ug/mL, respectively. The dynamic changes in coagulation parameters were tracked from day 1 to day 14 after admission at three day intervals (Figure 1).",
            "According to the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis (ISTH) diagnostic criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], 15 (71.4%) of the non-survivors matched the grade of overt-DIC ( \u2265 5 points) in later stages of NCP (Table 2), the median time from admission to DIC was 4 days (range, 1-12 days). On the contrary, only one (0.6%) survivor matched the DIC criteria during hospital stay.",
            "In our enrolled patients with NCP, the non-survivors revealed significantly higher D-dimer and FDP levels, longer PT and APTT compared to survivors on admission. By the late hospitalization, the fibrinogen and AT levels were also significantly lower in non-survivors, this suggested that conventional coagulation parameters during course of NCP were significantly associated with prognosis.",
            "DIC appeared in most of the deaths. Patient presenting with a virus infection may develop into sepsis associated with organ dysfunction. Sepsis is well established as one of the most common causes of DIC, development of DIC results when monocytes and endothelial cells are activated to the point of cytokine release following injury, with expression of tissue factor and secretion of von Willebrand factor. Circulation of free thrombin, uncontrolled by natural anticoagulants, can activate platelets and stimulate fibrinolysis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. At the late stages of NCP, levels of fibrin-related markers (D-dimer and FDP) moderately or markedly elevated in all deaths, that suggested a common coagulation activation and secondary hyperfibrinolysis condition in these patients.",
            "In a previous study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], Gralinski et al investigated viral pathogenesis and identify a novel host pathway involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus disease progression. Their data suggest that dysregulation of the urokinase pathway during SARS-coronavirus infection contributes to more severe lung pathology and that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 plays a protective role following infection. In addition, Fatma Berriet al. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] reported that plasminogen contributes to inflammation caused by influenza through fibrinolysis, and 6-aminocaproic acid can protects against influenza. Presumably, fibrinolysis may also be induced following severe 2019-nCoV infection.",
            "The limitations of this report included that, as a relatively small, single-center study, the mortality and characteristics of enrolled patients may not be representative, our findings should be confirmed in an adequately powered clinical study. In addition, some patients are still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission. Nonetheless, the present study has shown that existence of DIC is common in deaths with NCP, abnormal coagulation results, especially markedly elevated D-dimer and FDP, may have the potential to guide therapy and evaluate prognosis."
