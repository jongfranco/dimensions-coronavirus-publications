Based on previously published model estimates [4], the fraction of cases reported increased from 2.4% on 12 January 2020 to 11% on 18 January 2020 [4]. Our model suggests that (assuming Re remained close to 2.3 after the quarantine on 24 January 2020) reported cases increased to 59% by 31 January 2020 (9930 reported cases vs. 16 860 modeled cases) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].

Contours generated by the model with intervention give us information about which (average) reproduction numbers may be plausible and which are implausible (Figure 2). If Re had fallen to 1.0 after 24 January 2020, the model predicts fewer cases than are currently being reported (as of 3 February 2020), making this level of control implausible. By contrast, reduction to an Re of 1.5 is plausible on the basis of reported cases and model estimates up to 3 February 2020, but it would also imply complete reporting."

Comparison of modeled and reported case counts suggests that reporting lags are decreasing and case ascertainment increasing over time. The narrowing gap between modeled and confirmed cases shows that the massive public health effort under way in China is increasing ascertainment of 2019-nCoV cases.

        "Introduction": [
            "Confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China and other countries have increased sharply [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], leading to concerns regarding its pandemic potential.",
            "Viral epidemiology has been characterized sufficiently to permit construction of transmission models that predict the future course of this epidemic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]"
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "The authors developed a simple disease-transmission model in which the 2019-nCoV epidemic was modeled as a branching process starting in mid-November 2019, with a serial interval of 7 days and a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.3, based on available data and assuming no intervention (Figure 1).",
            "In the absence of control measures, the total number of cases after t serial intervals depends on R0 and the number of epidemic generations.",
            "Introduction of control is assumed to reduce the reproduction number to Re. The last generation with uncontrolled growth is indicated by tc, with an incident case count of Itc, and the authors can use the right-hand equation to calculate case numbers in the presence of control."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "Comparison of cumulative case numbers versus model-generated counts shows that reported case numbers remain lower than modeled estimates, but ascertainment is increasingly complete over time (Figure 2).",
            "The fraction of cases reported would be even higher if the reproduction number were lower because of control efforts.",
            "Figure 2 shows a narrowing between case counts generated by the model and those reported by public health authorities over time.",
            "This suggests decreasing reporting times.",
            "If Re had fallen to 1.0 after 24 January 2020, the model predicts fewer cases than are currently being reported, making this level of control implausible.",
            "Reduction to an Re of 1.5 is plausible on the basis of reported cases and model estimates up to 3 February 2020, but it would imply complete reporting"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Using a simple model of epidemic growth that includes the representation of control efforts can provide helpful insights into the growth of the 2019-nCoV epidemic that are not directly observable in publicly reported data.",
            "Contour plots can be used to indirectly estimate Re after introduction of control efforts, because case counts exceeding a given contour suggest that an Re value is implausible.",
            "Potential limitations of this model include underrepresentation of mild infections and its focus on an epidemic currently centered in China.",
            "The tool may help policymakers by allowing inferences about likely underlying dynamics of the epidemic, even when available disease data are delayed or incomplete"
