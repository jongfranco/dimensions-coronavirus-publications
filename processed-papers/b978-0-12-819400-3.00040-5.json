        "journal": "Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens",
        "abstract": "Viruses of human or animal origin can spread in the environment and infect people via water and food. These viruses are released into the environment by various routes including water runoffs and aerosols. Furthermore, zoonotic viruses may infect humans exposed to contaminated surface waters.\nViruses are emerging pathogens and are able to adapt by mutation, recombination, and reassortment and can thus become able to infect new hosts and to adjust to new environments. Enteric viruses are among the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens, causing both sporadic and outbreak-related illness.",
