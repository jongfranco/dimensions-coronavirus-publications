        "abstract": "The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

This came just one month after the first reported case on 31 December 2019 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). WHO, in its first emergency meeting (World-Health-Organization, 2020a), estimated the fatality rate of COVID-19 to be around 4%.

However, some recent human coronavirus infections have resulted in lethal endemics, which include the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) endemics. Both of these are caused by zoonotic coronaviruses that belong to the genus Betacoronavirus within Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV originated from Southern China and caused an endemic in 2003.

SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to be close to SARS-CoV\u2014much more so than MERS-CoV\u2014based on full-length genome phylogenetic analysis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLu_et+al_2020_a\">Lu et al, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2020_a\">Zhou et al, 2020</a>). We checked whether this is also true at the level of the individual structural proteins (S, E, M, and N). A straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was notably reduced (but still high) (Figure 1a). The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins (Figure 1a); a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b). We note that while the former analysis (Figure 1a) was based on the reference sequence of each coronavirus, it is indeed a good representative of the virus population, since few amino acid mutations have been observed in the corresponding sequence data (Figure S1). It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not been observed since 2004."

            "The quest for a vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as an urgent problem. Effective vaccination could indeed play a significant role in curbing the spread of the virus, and help to eliminate it from the human population. However, scientific efforts to address this challenge are only just beginning. Much remains to be learnt about the virus, its biological properties, epidemiology, etc. At this early stage, there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, which presents a challenge for vaccine development.<br/><br/>This study has sought to assist with the initial phase of vaccine development, by providing recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in subunit vaccine designs. Despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to SARS-CoV-2, these epitopes are motivated by their responses that they have recorded in SARS-CoV (or, for the case of T cell epitopes, to at least confer MHC binding), and the fact that they map identically to SARS-CoV-2, based on the available sequence data (as of 9 February 2020). The identical map between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of any mutation in the identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), suggests their potential for eliciting a robust T cell or antibody response in SARS-CoV-2."

            "The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

We checked whether this is also true at the level of the individual structural proteins (S, E, M, and N). A straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this, showing that the M, N, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have over 90% genetic similarity, while that of the S protein was notably reduced (but still high) (Figure 1a). The similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was substantially lower for all proteins (Figure 1a); a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 1b). We note that while the former analysis (Figure 1a) was based on the reference sequence of each coronavirus, it is indeed a good representative of the virus population, since few amino acid mutations have been observed in the corresponding sequence data (Figure S1). It is also noteworthy that while MERS-CoV is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans, and is comparatively more recurrent (causing outbreaks in 2012, 2015, and 2018) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV, which has not been observed since 2004.",
            "Given the close genetic similarity between the structural proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we attempted to leverage immunological studies of the structural proteins of SARS-CoV to potentially aid vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2. We focused specifically on the S and N proteins as these are known to induce potent and long-lived immune responses in SARS-CoV (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChannappanavar_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rChannappanavar_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChannappanavar_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rChannappanavar_et+al_2014_a\">Channappanavar et al, 2014</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDeming_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rDeming_et+al_2006_a\">Deming et al, 2006</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGraham_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rGraham_et+al_2012_a\">Graham et al, 2012</a>; W.

We used the available SARS-CoV-derived experimentally-determined epitope data (see Materials and Methods) and searched to identify T cell and B cell epitopes that were identical\u2014 and hence potentially cross-reactive\u2014across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We first report the analysis for T cell epitopes, which have been shown to provide a long-lasting immune response against SARSCoV (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChannappanavar_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rChannappanavar_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChannappanavar_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rChannappanavar_et+al_2014_a\">Channappanavar et al, 2014</a></a>), followed by a discussion of B cell epitopes.",
            "Mapping the SARS-CoV-derived T cell epitopes that are identical in SARS-CoV-2, and determining those with greatest estimated population coverage. The SARS-CoV-derived T cell epitopes used in this study were experimentally-determined from two different types of assays (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPickett_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rPickett_et+al_2012_a\">Pickett et al, 2012</a>): (i) positive T cell assays, which tested for a T cell response against epitopes, and (ii) positive MHC binding assays, which tested for epitope-MHC binding. We aligned these T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences. Among the 115 T cell epitopes that were determined by positive T cell assays (Table 1), we found that 27 epitope-sequences were identical within SARS-CoV2 proteins and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020) (Table 2). Interestingly, all of these were present in either the N (16) or S (11) protein. MHC binding assays were performed for 19 of these 27 epitopes, and these were reported to be associated with only five distinct MHC alleles (at 4-digit resolution): HLA-A*02:01, HLA-B*40:01, HLA-DRA*01:01, HLADRB1*07:01, and HLA-DRB1*04:01. Consequently, the accumulated population coverage of these epitopes (see Materials and Methods for details) is estimated to not be high for the global population (59.76%), and was quite low for China (32.36%). For the remaining 8 epitopes, since the associated MHC alleles are unknown, they could not be used in the population coverage computation. Additional MHC binding tests to identify the MHC alleles that bind to these 8 epitopes may reveal additional distinct alleles, beyond the five determined so far, that may help to improve population coverage.",
            "To further expand the search and identify potentially effective T cell targets covering a higher percentage of the population, we next additionally considered the set of T cell epitopes that have been experimentally-determined from positive MHC binding assays (Table 1), but, unlike the previous epitope set, their ability to induce a T cell response against SARS-CoV was not experimentally determined. Nonetheless, they also present promising candidates for inducing a response against SARS-CoV-2. For the expanded set of epitopes, all of which have at least one positive MHC binding assay, we found that 264 epitope-sequences have an identical match in SARS-CoV-2 proteins and have associated MHC allele information available (listed in Table S2). Of these 264 epitopes, ~80% were MHC Class I restricted epitopes (Table S3). Importantly, 102 of the 264 epitopes were derived from either the S (66) or N (36) protein. Mapping all 66 S-derived epitopes onto the resolved crystal structure of the SARSCoV S protein (Figure 2) revealed that 3 of these (GYQPYRVVVL, QPYRVVVLSF, and PYRVVVLSF) were located entirely in the SARS-CoV receptor-binding motif, known to be important for virus cell entry (F. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_2005_a\" href=\"#rLi_2005_a\">Li, 2005</a>).",
            "Similar to previous studies on HIV and HCV (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAhmed_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rAhmed_et+al_2019_a\">Ahmed, Quadeer, Morales-Jimenez, & McKay, 2019</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDahirel_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rDahirel_et+al_2011_a\">Dahirel et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cQuadeer_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rQuadeer_et+al_2014_a\">Quadeer et al, 2014</a>), we estimated population coverages for various combinations of MHC alleles associated with these 102 epitopes. Our aim was to determine sets of epitopes associated with MHC alleles with maximum population coverage, potentially aiding the development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. For selection, we adopted a greedy computational approach (see Materials and Methods), which identified a set of T cell epitopes estimated to maximize global population coverage. This set comprised of multiple T cell epitopes associated with 20 distinct MHC alleles and was estimated to provide an accumulated population coverage of 96.29% (Table 3). We also computed the population coverage of this specific set of epitopes in China, the country most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, which was estimated to be slightly lower (88.11%) as certain MHC alleles (e.g., HLA-A*02:01) associated with some of these epitopes are less frequent in the Chinese population (Table 3). Repeating the same greedy approach but focusing on the Chinese population, instead of a global population, the maximum population coverage was estimated to be 92.76% (Table S4).",
            "Due to the promiscuous nature of binding between peptides and MHC alleles, multiple S and N peptides were reported to bind to individual MHC alleles. Thus, while we list all the S and N epitopes that bind to each MHC allele (Table 3), the estimated maximum population coverage may be achieved by selecting at least one epitope for each listed MHC allele. Likewise, many individual S and N epitopes were found to be presented by multiple alleles and thereby estimated to have varying global population coverage (Table S5).",
            "Mapping the SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes that are identical in SARS-CoV-2. Similar to T cell epitopes, we used in our study the SARS-CoV-derived B cell epitopes that have been experimentally-determined from positive B cell assays (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPickett_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rPickett_et+al_2012_a\">Pickett et al, 2012</a>). These epitopes were classified as: (i) linear B cell epitopes (antigenic peptides), and (ii) discontinuous B cell epitopes (conformational epitopes with resolved structural determinants).",
            "We aligned the 298 linear B cell epitopes (Table 1) across the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and found that 50 epitope-sequences, all derived from structural proteins, have an identical match and comprised no mutation in the available SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (as of 9 February 2020). Interestingly, a large number (45) of these were derived from either the S (23) or N (22) protein (Table 4), while the remaining (5) were from the M and E proteins (Table S6).",
            "On the other hand, all 6 SARS-CoV-derived discontinuous B cell epitopes obtained from the ViPR database (Table 5) were derived from the S protein. Based on the pairwise alignment between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences (Figure S2), we found that none of these mapped identically to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, in contrast to the linear epitopes. For 3 of these discontinuous B cell epitopes there was a partial mapping, with at least one site having an identical residue at the corresponding site in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Table 5).",
            "Mapping the residues of the B cell epitopes onto the available structure of the SARS-CoV S protein revealed that the linear epitopes (Table 4) map to seemingly less-exposed regions, away from the most exposed region, the \u201cspike head\u201d (Figure 3a). In contrast, all discontinuous B cell epitopes (Table 5) map onto the spike head region (Figure 3b, top panel), which contains the receptor-binding motif of the SARS-CoV S protein (F. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_2005_a\" href=\"#rLi_2005_a\">Li, 2005</a>). We observe that few residues of the discontinuous epitopes that lie within the receptor-binding motif are identical within SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3b). It has been reported recently that SARS-CoV-2 is able to bind to the same receptor as SARS-CoV (ACE2) for cell entry, despite having multiple amino acid differences with SARS-CoV\u2019s receptor-binding motif (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHoffmann_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rHoffmann_et+al_2020_a\">Hoffmann et al, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLetko_2020_a\" href=\"#rLetko_2020_a\">Letko & Munster, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rLu_et+al_2020_a\">Lu et al, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2020_a\">Zhou et al, 2020</a>). Whether the antibodies specific to this motif maintain their binding and elicit an immune response against SARSCoV-2 warrants further experimental investigation."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "The quest for a vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as an urgent problem. Effective vaccination could indeed play a significant role in curbing the spread of the virus, and help to eliminate it from the human population. However, scientific efforts to address this challenge are only just beginning. Much remains to be learnt about the virus, its biological properties, epidemiology, etc. At this early stage, there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, which presents a challenge for vaccine development.",
            "This study has sought to assist with the initial phase of vaccine development, by providing recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in subunit vaccine designs. Despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to SARS-CoV-2, these epitopes are motivated by their responses that they have recorded in SARS-CoV (or, for the case of T cell epitopes, to at least confer MHC binding), and the fact that they map identically to SARS-CoV-2, based on the available sequence data (as of 9 February 2020). The identical map between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of any mutation in the identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), suggests their potential for eliciting a robust T cell or antibody response in SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Research efforts directed towards the design and development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are increasing, and some related analyses are already being reported in distinct, parallel studies. Notably, a preliminary analysis of linear B cell epitopes has been reported online on the ViPR database website (https://www.viprbrc.org/brcDocs/documents/announcements/Corona/2019-nCoV-ViPRreport_24JAN2020.pdf). Different from our study, which is focused on the linear and discontinuous SARS-CoV-derived epitopes, that analysis considered linear B cell epitope data for all Betacoronaviruses from human hosts. While only a summary of the results has been provided so far, preventing direct comparison of the individual epitopes, the number of linear B cell epitopes reported to map identically to SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to our findings.",
            "A recent study has also predicted T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 that may be presented by a population from the Asia-Pacific region (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRamaiah_2020_a\" href=\"#rRamaiah_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRamaiah_2020_a\" href=\"#rRamaiah_2020_a\">Ramaiah & Arumugaswami, 2020</a></a>). Again, there are multiple differences to our work. First, the focus of that study was on MHC Class II epitopes, while here we considered both MHC Class I and II epitopes. Interestingly, while we found a few MHC Class II epitopes using our approach (Table S3), only one of these (HLA-DRB1*01:01) appeared in our identified epitope set (Table 3), due to their comparatively low estimated population coverage. Second, computational tools were used to predict MHC Class II epitopes in (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRamaiah_2020_a\" href=\"#rRamaiah_2020_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRamaiah_2020_a\" href=\"#rRamaiah_2020_a\">Ramaiah & Arumugaswami, 2020</a></a>), while here we analysed the SARS-CoV-derived epitopes that have been determined experimentally, using either positive T cell or MHC binding assays, and which match identically with the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020).",
            "We acknowledge that this is a preliminary analysis based on the limited sequence data available for SARS-CoV-2 (as of 9 February 2020). As the virus continues to evolve and as more data is collected, it is expected that additional mutations will be observed. Such mutations will not affect our analysis, provided that they occur outside of the identified epitope regions. If mutations do occur within epitope regions, then these epitopes may be further screened in line with the conservative filtering principle that we have employed, thereby producing a more refined epitope set.",
            "Further experimental studies (T cell and B cell assays) are required to determine the potential of the identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This would help to further refine the reported epitope set, based on observed immunogenicity; an important consideration for immunogen design. Overall, as the identified set of epitopes map identically to SARS-CoV-2, they present potentially useful candidates for guiding experimental efforts towards developing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2."
