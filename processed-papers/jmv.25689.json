        "abstract": "To help health workers and the public recognize and deal with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV) quickly, effectively, and calmly with an updated understanding. A comprehensive search from Chinese and worldwide official websites and announcements was performed between 1 December 2019 and 9:30 AM 26 January 2020 (Beijing time). A latest summary of 2019\u2010nCoV and the current outbreak was drawn. Up to 24 PM, 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases of 2019\u2010nCoV infection were confirmed in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths having occurred. The latest mortality was approximately 2.84% with a total of 2684 cases still suspected. The China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 PM, 22 January 2020. The deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median age of the people who died was 75 (range 48\u201089) years. Fever (64.7%) and cough (52.9%) were the most common first symptoms among those who died. The median number of days from the occurence of the first symptom to death was 14.0 (range 6\u201041) days, and it tended to be shorter among people aged 70 years or more (11.5 [range 6\u201019] days) than those aged less than 70 years (20 [range 10\u201041] days; P = .033). The 2019\u2010nCoV infection is spreading and its incidence is increasing nationwide. The first deaths occurred mostly in elderly people, among whom the disease might progress faster. The public should still be cautious in dealing with the virus and pay more attention to protecting the elderly people from the virus.",

Another possible reason for the fast spreading would be the Spring Festival travel rush, in which thousands of millions of people were on the move heading home and the virus would definitely spread quickly, especially with those coming out from Wuhan.<br/><br/>Our study also demonstrated that the 2019\u2010nCoV had caused a total 1975 infections and 56 deaths in 26 days since the first official announcement.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] The current mortality of the 2019\u2010nCoV is approximately 2.84%, which is lower than that of 9.6% of the SARS\u2010CoV that spread globally to 30 countries/regions, infected 8098 people, and killed 774 patients from November 2002 to July 2003,25 and lower than that of 34.4% of the MERS\u2010CoV, which spread globally to 27 countries/regions, infected 2494 people and killed 858 patients from September 2012 to September 2019.26 However, in the first 3 months from November 2002 to February 2003,27 Guangdong, China, had only witnessed a diagnosis of the atypical pneumonia initially considered chlamydia pneumoniae (later confirmed to be caused by SARS) in 305 cases with 5 deaths. Taken together, these facts show that although the current mortality is lower than that of the SARS\u2010CoV and the MERS\u2010CoV, it seems that the 2019\u2010nCoV is very contagious. The public should be cautious about the development of the disease."

        "| DISCUSSION": [
            "Our study has demonstrated the fast spreading of the novel virus in mainland China since the first official announcement on 31 December 2019 by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] The infection has very quickly increased between 20 January 2020 and 25 January 2020 according to the National Health Commission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] Possibly, the detection and reporting of the infection has attacted more importance since it was reported nationwide. Another possible reason for the fast spreading would be the Spring Festival travel rush, in which thousands of millions of people were on the move heading home and the virus would definitely spread quickly, especially with those coming out from Wuhan.",
            "Our study also demonstrated that the 2019\u2010nCoV had caused a total 1975 infections and 56 deaths in 26 days since the first official announcement.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] The current mortality of the 2019\u2010nCoV is approximately 2.84%, which is lower than that of 9.6% of the SARS\u2010CoV that spread globally to 30 countries/regions, infected 8098 people, and killed 774 patients from November 2002 to July 2003,25 and lower than that of 34.4% of the MERS\u2010CoV, which spread globally to 27 countries/regions, infected 2494 people and killed 858 patients from September 2012 to September 2019.26 However, in the first 3 months from November 2002 to February 2003,27 Guangdong, China, had only witnessed a diagnosis of the atypical pneumonia initially considered chlamydia pneumoniae (later confirmed to be caused by SARS) in 305 cases with 5 deaths. Taken together, these facts show that although the current mortality is lower than that of the SARS\u2010CoV and the MERS\u2010CoV, it seems that the 2019\u2010nCoV is very contagious. The public should be cautious about the development of the disease.",
            "Our study also showed that the first occurred deaths were mainly among elderly people. Although most of them had comorbidities or a history of surgery before admission, the potential association of underlying medical conditions and 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010associated death was not clear. By far, the median number of days of first symptom to death was 14, which was comparable to that of 14 days (median) of MERS.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] For SARS, it was reported that the average duration of first symptoms to hospital admission was 3.8 days, and admission to death was 17.4 days for casualties.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] Our study also found that people 70 years or older had shorter median days (11.5 days) from the first symptom to death than those with ages below 70 years (20 days), demonstrating that elderly people might have faster disease progression than younger people. Similar results were found in SARS in that the mean duration from admission to death was 5.7 days for people aged 80 to 93 years, 9.4 days for those aged 60 to 79 years, and above 12.0 days for those under 60 years of age.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] It was also reported that older age (>60 years) was a risk factor that correlated with mortality in MERS.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] From the above, although a definite comparison could not be drawn, the public should pay attention to elderly people who might be more vulnerable to the 2019\u2010nCoV.",
            "Currently there is a lack of definite and effective treatment. The health workers and public should be cautious in preventing and controlling the disease. The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention released an updated and interim guidance[30] and provided a patient under investigation (PUI) form,[31] which was available for suspected cases. Patients falling under the following criteria should be considered a PUI in association with the 2019\u2010nCoV: first, those who had fever combined with symptoms of lower respiratory illness (eg, cough, breathing difficulties), and had Wuhan traveling history in the last 2 weeks before symptom onset or close contact with an ill person who was also under investigation for 2019\u2010nCoV. Second, those who had fever or had symptoms of lower respiratory illness (eg, cough, breathing difficulties), and close contact with an ill lab\u2010confirmed 2019\u2010nCoV patient.",
            "In addition, the WHO also provided an interim guidance for infection prevention and control when a novel coronavirus was suspected[32] and further improved the guidance by indicating that patients with mild symptoms and without chronic conditions or symptomatic patients no longer requiring hospitalization might be cared for in home environment.[33] Another aspect worth noting is that health workers should minimize the possibility of exposure when collecting and transporting lab specimens of suspected infected patients.[32,34] A goggle was necessary when health workers were questioning patients at fever clinics or performing operations for suspected patients since the virus might infect the eye conjunctiva through droplets. It would be interesting to test if robotics might be used in questioning or treating the infected or suspected patients, which will definitely decrease the possibility of exposure of health workers.",
            "Although the etiology is still unclear, some scholars suggest that 2019\u2010nCoV and SARS/SARS\u2010like coronaviruses may share a common ancestor resembling the bat coronavirus HKU9\u20101.10 The 2019\u2010nCoV may interact with human ACE2 molecules via its S\u2010protein for human \u2010to\u2010human transmission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] However, future studies are warranted to uncover the source of the virus and potential mechanisms for human\u2010 to\u2010human transmission."
        ],
        "| CONCLUSION": [
            "The 2019\u2010nCoV infection is spreading fast with an increasing number of infected patients nationwide. The future development of the disease is not clear but the public should be cautious in dealing with the virus since it may be very contagious. The first occurred deaths were majorly elderly people who might have faster disease progression. The public should pay more attention to protecting elderly people who have contracted the virus.",
