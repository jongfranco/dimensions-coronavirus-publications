The hope is that the early implementation of these measures will be effective in preventing large-scale spread of the virus. According to the mayor Zhou Xianwang, at a press conference on January 26th, 2020, approximately five million residents left Wuhan for other provinces within China and thousands of people left Wuhan for other countries before the lockdown. Wuhan is home to a large number of immigrants, and thousands of international students in its 89 universities and colleges were also heading home for the holidays [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Therefore, we can expect this large-scale movement of people to lead to the outbreak spreading within China to other provinces, as well as to other countries. A large-scale programme to identify and screen exposed persons should help control the virus. However, this is a very challenging and time-consuming task; the Governments of China and other susceptible countries need to be on red alert and to design strategies for this and for future outbreaks of infection with novel viruses. In China and other countries this may necessitate more regulation around the retail market in wild animals.",
            "The control of 2019n-CoV will remain challenging as travel restrictions are lifted and potentially infectious people begin to move around more. Screening at airports is one key control measure, but already one lady has managed to mask her symptoms and signs, evading coronavirus health checks at the airport [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. It is not yet clear whether 2019n-CoV has the potential to cause a global pandemic. However, in the mean time, as well as the obvious concerns about the lack of specific treatment or a vaccine, the psychological and economic stresses resulting from control measures such as mass quarantining should not be underestimated. 2019n-CoV is perhaps the first novel infection with pandemic potential to emerge in the era of large-scale social media use. Authorities need to be mindful of both the potentially negative and positive impacts of social media in managing outbreaks of infection in the community."

            "A research team in Shenzhen and Shanghai has already isolated the 2019n-CoV and developed the first candidate vaccine.",
            "S. Khan et al / Journal of Hospital Infection 104 (2020) 252e253 of army medical units, and the construction of two emergency hospitals in Wuhan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].",
            "The hope is that the early implementation of these measures will be effective in preventing large-scale spread of the virus.",
            "According to the mayor Zhou Xianwang, at a press conference on January 26th, 2020, approximately five million residents left Wuhan for other provinces within China and thousands of people left Wuhan for other countries before the lockdown.",
            "The authors can expect this large-scale movement of people to lead to the outbreak spreading within China to other provinces, as well as to other countries.",
            "A large-scale programme to identify and screen exposed persons should help control the virus.",
            "This is a very challenging and time-consuming task; the Governments of China and other susceptible countries need to be on red alert and to design strategies for this and for future outbreaks of infection with novel viruses.",
            "In China and other countries this may necessitate more regulation around the retail market in wild animals.",
            "The control of 2019n-CoV will remain challenging as travel restrictions are lifted and potentially infectious people begin to move around more."

        "Conclusion": [
            "It is not yet clear whether 2019n-CoV has the potential to cause a global pandemic.",
            "In the mean time, as well as the obvious concerns about the lack of specific treatment or a vaccine, the psychological and economic stresses resulting from control measures such as mass quarantining should not be underestimated.",
            "2019n-CoV is perhaps the first novel infection with pandemic potential to emerge in the era of large-scale social media use.",
            "Authorities need to be mindful of both the potentially negative and positive impacts of social media in managing outbreaks of infection in the community."
