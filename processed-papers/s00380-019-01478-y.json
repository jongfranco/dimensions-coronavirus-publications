The object of present study was to investigate the association of circulating levels of ACE2, Ang-(1\u20137) and Ang-(1\u20139) with coronary heart disease (CHD) defined by coronary angiography (CAG). 275 patients who were referred to CAG for the evaluation of suspected CHD were enrolled and divided into two groups: CHD group (diameter narrowing \u2265 50%, n = 218) and non-CHD group (diameter narrowing n = 57). Circulating ACE2, Ang-(1\u20137) and Ang-(1\u20139) levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

However, circulating Ang-(1\u20137) and Ang-(1\u20139) levels had no significant differences between the two groups.
