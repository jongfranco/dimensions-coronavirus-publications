            "All TR34/L98H/S297T/F495I, TR34/L98H, and TR46/Y121F/T289A isolates exhibited cross-resistance to difenoconazole and tebuconazole (both triazole fungicides) without fitness cost, demonstrated by normal growth rates (Appendix Figure 2). The TR34/L98H/S297T/F495I isolates and TR46/Y121F/T289A isolates were also resistant to prochloraz (an imidazole fungicide) (Appendix Table 2). The prevalence of TR34/L98H/S297T/F495I isolates in Taiwan might be attributed to widespread use of prochloraz over the past 3 decades. Studies have suggested an association between use of imidazole fungicides and emergence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus with TR34/L98H/S297T/F495I mutations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "In Taiwan, the annual consumption of difenoconazole and tebuconazole has exceeded that of prochloraz since 2012 (Appendix Figure 3), further creating a favorable environment for maintenance and spread of TR34/L98H, TR34/L98H/S297T/F495I, and TR46/Y121F/T289A isolates. Thus, the One Health approach to implement environmental antifungal stewardship is warranted to minimize ongoing resistance selection in the fields.",
            "Six azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates with wild-type cyp51A were obtained from 2 patients. Four pan azole-resistant urinary isolates were sequentially recovered from a patient (no. 11) with A. fumigatus renal abscesses who was receiving voriconazole for >3 months in whom an initial urine isolate was susceptible to azole; all 5 isolates were genetically identical.",
            "Overexpression of cdr1B (a drug efflux transporter) and an S269P mutation in hmg1 (a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase) were identified in 4 resistant isolates but not in the initial susceptible isolate (Appendix Table 5, Figure 4), suggesting their roles involved in azole resistance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Another 2 pan azole-resistant respiratory isolates were recovered from a patient (no. 12) who had pulmonary aspergillosis and was receiving voriconazole for 4 months. Azole-susceptible and azole-resistant isolates co-existed in this patient, which echoes the international recommendation suggesting testing multiple colonies (>5) from a single culture [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Cyp51A overexpression and an F262 deletion in hmg1(hmg1F262_del) were identified in these 2 resistant isolates. Although hmg1F261_del was recently reported in azole-resistant A. fumigatus from a voriconazole-exposed patient [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], whether cyp51A overexpression and hmg1F262_del act synergistically to cause resistance warrants further studies.",
            "Finally, reduced colony sizes were observed in all 6 azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates with wild-type cyp51A (Appendix Figure 2). Thus, attention should be paid to select colonies of various sizes for susceptibility testing from patients with azole exposure.",
            "Overall, 4 patients harboring azole-resistant A. fumigatus with environmental mutations and 2 patients harboring azole-resistant A. fumigatus with wild-type cyp51A showed development of invasive aspergillosis, and all had aspergillosis-related deaths. High mortality rates for azole-resistant aspergillosis we observed (6/6, 100%) and for those from a previous report [10] emphasize the need for a proposed integrated algorithm for management and control of azole-resistant aspergillosis (Appendix Table 6).",
            "In conclusion, we report a health threat that arose from clinical and environmental use of azoles; environmental use contributed at a larger and global scale. These data necessitate diagnostic stewardship in the clinic and antifungal stewardship in the environment.",
