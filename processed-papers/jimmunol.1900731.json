            "In summary, these results indicate that PRRSV infection induces SOCS1 production through the p38/AP-1 and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways. The PRRSV N protein induces SOCS1 production through the JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway.",
            "In conclusion, to our knowledge, it has been reported in this article for the first time that PRRSV and PRRSV N protein are able to induce SOCS1 production, which is exploited by PRRSV to facilitate the replication of PRRSV through a molecular mechanism that involves AP-1 signaling pathway but not the autoregulatory action of type I IFNs. The findings of this study provide novel (to our knowledge) insights into the strategies employed by PRRSV to subvert the host immune response."

            "PRRSV infection induces SOCS1 expression in porcine AMs, Marc-145 cells, and CRL2843-CD163 cells<br/><br/>Previous studies have assessed SOCS and CIS transcript expression in various porcine tissues [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. However, little information is available concerning SOCS expression and regulation by PRRSV in porcine AMs as well as several PRRSV-permissive cell lines. To determine whether PRRSV alters the expression of SOCS family of proteins, porcine AMs were infected with PRRSV-2 strain HN07-1 for 24 h, and then SOCS1-7 and CIS mRNA expressions were assessed. SOCS1 was one of the upregulated SOCS proteins during PRRSV infection (data not shown). Thus, the expression kinetics of SOCS1 in several PRRSV-susceptible cells infected with different PRRSV strains were investigated. Porcine AMs were inoculated with PRRSV-2 strain HN07-1 at an MOI of 1. The cells were harvested at the indicated time points to quantify SOCS1 mRNA and protein levels using qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA. The results show that PRRSV significantly upregulated SOCS1 mRNA levels at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi, with expression peaking at 12 hpi (11.5-fold, Fig. 1A). PRRSV infection also increased SOCS1 protein levels at 12, 24, and 36 hpi, with expression peaking at 36 hpi (Fig. 1B, 1C). To confirm this result, porcine AMs were infected with HN07-1 at MOIs of 1, 2, and 10 for 12 h. The results show that the increase of SOCS1 by PRRSV was in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Because monkeyderived Marc-145 cells and PRRSV-permissive CRL2843CD163 cells are typically used to study PRRSV infection in vitro, there was contemplation on the possibility of PRRSV having the same impact on SOCS1 expression in both cell lines. Similar results were obtained in Marc-145 cells and CRL2843CD163 (Fig. 1E, 1F, Supplemental Fig. 1A, 1B). The effects of the other three representative PRRSV strains, BJ-4 (a PRRSV-2 strain with low pathogenicity), HNhx (an NADC30-like PRRSV-2 strain isolated in China), and GZ11-G1 (a PRRSV-1 strain), were also tested. As shown in Fig. 1G and 1H and Supplemental"

        "discussion": [
            "To evade innate immune responses, viruses hijack cellular proteins to impair host immunity to establish persistent infection. In this study, it has been shown that PRRSV promoted self-replication through a mechanism involving SOCS1 induction. It was observed that PRRSV infection strongly induced SOCS1 production in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). SOCS1 upregulation by PRRSV was not fully dependent on type I IFNs but was involved in p38/AP-1 and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways (Figs. 7\u20139). Using luciferase reporter assays, the thought that PRRSV N protein might significantly upregulate SOCS1 expression was completely screened out (Fig. 5, Supplemental Fig. 4A\u2013E). It was further proven that NLS-2 of N protein played a critical role in SOCS1 promoter activation (Fig. 5). Taken together, the results of this study uncovered an unappreciated mechanism employed by PRRSV to suppress host immune response and enable efficient virus replication."

            "Previous studies have assessed SOCS and CIS transcript expression in various porcine tissues [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. However, little information is available concerning SOCS expression and regulation by PRRSV in porcine AMs as well as several PRRSV-permissive cell lines. To determine whether PRRSV alters the expression of SOCS family of proteins, porcine AMs were infected with PRRSV-2 strain HN07-1 for 24 h, and then SOCS1-7 and CIS mRNA expressions were assessed. SOCS1 was one of the upregulated SOCS proteins during PRRSV infection (data not shown). Thus, the expression kinetics of SOCS1 in several PRRSV-susceptible cells infected with different PRRSV strains were investigated. Porcine AMs were inoculated with PRRSV-2 strain HN07-1 at an MOI of 1. The cells were harvested at the indicated time points to quantify SOCS1 mRNA and protein levels using qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA. The results show that PRRSV significantly upregulated SOCS1 mRNA levels at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi, with expression peaking at 12 hpi (11.5-fold, Fig. 1A). PRRSV infection also increased SOCS1 protein levels at 12, 24, and 36 hpi, with expression peaking at 36 hpi (Fig. 1B, 1C). To confirm this result, porcine AMs were infected with HN07-1 at MOIs of 1, 2, and 10 for 12 h. The results show that the increase of SOCS1 by PRRSV",
            "was in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Because monkeyderived Marc-145 cells and PRRSV-permissive CRL2843CD163 cells are typically used to study PRRSV infection in vitro, there was contemplation on the possibility of PRRSV having the same impact on SOCS1 expression in both cell lines. Similar results were obtained in Marc-145 cells and CRL2843CD163 (Fig. 1E, 1F, Supplemental Fig. 1A, 1B). The effects of the other three representative PRRSV strains, BJ-4 (a PRRSV-2 strain with low pathogenicity), HNhx (an NADC30-like PRRSV-2 strain isolated in China), and GZ11-G1 (a PRRSV-1 strain), were also tested. As shown in Fig. 1G and 1H and Supplemental",
            "Fig. 1C and 1D, all strains induced SOCS1 mRNA expression, which suggests that SOCS1 upregulation was not dependent on PRRSV strains. The effects of heat-inactivated and UVinactivated PRRSV on SOCS1 induction were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 1I, heat-inactivated and UV-inactivated PRRSV hardly induced SOCS1 mRNA expression, which indicates that the induction of SOCS1 by PRRSV depended on virus replication. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrated that PRRSV remarkably upregulated SOCS1 expression at both the transcriptional levels and translational levels (Tables I, II).",

            "Based on the fact that SOCS1 is a classical negative feedback regulator of innate immune response, especially the JAK/STAT signaling pathways [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>], an investigation was carried out to determine the role of porcine SOCS1 in the regulation of IFN-b production. First, the IFN inhibitory effects of PRRSV were confirmed using IFN-b\u2013Luc assays. As shown in Supplemental Fig. 1E, PRRSV inhibited poly(I:C)-induced IFN-b promoter activities. Next, another investigation was carried out to determine whether SOCS1 had IFN inhibitory effects. CRL2843CD163 cells were transfected with an empty vector or an IFN-b\u2013Luc plasmid and a pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid in the presence or absence of an SOCS1 expression vector. Transfection with pcDNA3.1-SOCS1-His inhibited IFN-b\u2013Luc activity induced by poly(I:C) (Supplemental Fig. 1F). These results suggested that SOCS1 could inhibit poly(I:C)triggered IFN-b expression. Also, to investigate whether SOCS1 is involved in the suppression of IFN-b and ISGs upon PRRSV infection, porcine AMs were transfected with siRNAs specific for SOCS1 and then infected with HN07-1. At 24 hpi, the cells were collected, and the mRNA levels of IFN-b and ISGs (ISG56 and OAS1a) were assessed using qRT-PCR. As shown in Supplemental Fig. 1G\u2013I, silencing SOCS1 significantly enhanced IFN-b, ISG56, and OAS1a mRNA expression. Thus, it was speculated that SOCS1 might affect PRRSV replication. PRRSV titers were analyzed after inactivating SOCS1 expression by siRNA in porcine AMs. Porcine AMs were transfected with 20 nM siRNA for 24 h and then infected with HN07-1. At 24 hpi, the cells and supernatants were harvested and analyzed for the detection of PRRSV RNA using RT-PCR and PRRSV titers using a TCID50 assay. As shown in Fig. 2C and 2D, inactivating SOCS1 significantly suppressed PRRSV replication in porcine AMs. The levels of PRRSV ORF7 gene and viral titers were decreased to 34.0 and 16.1%, respectively, after the transfection of siRNA to silent the action of SOCS1. The knockdown efficiency of the siRNA against SOCS1 was assessed by qRT-PCR and ELISA (Fig. 2A, 2B). On the contrary, overexpression of SOCS1 by transfection of Marc145 cells or CRL2843-CD163 cells with SOCS1 expression constructs (pcDNA3.1-SOCS1-His) dramatically enhanced PRRSV replication (Fig. 2E, 2F). Therefore, it was concluded that PRRSV may hijack the host cell SOCS1 to facilitate its own replication.",

The cytotoxicity and inhibitory effects of B18R in porcine AMs were first assessed. A cell viability assay indicated that no concentrations of B18R used in this assay caused detectable cell death in porcine AMs (Supplemental Fig. 2B). SOCS1 mRNA expression induced by IFN-a and IFN-b, as well as ISG56 and OAS1a mRNA expression, was nearly abrogated by B18R (Supplemental Fig. 2C\u2013E). Production of SOCS1 protein induced by IFN-a and IFN-b was also significantly decreased by B18R (Supplemental Fig. 2F). These results indicated that B18R can effectively block the signaling pathways downstream of type I IFN, thereby abrogating the expression of SOCS1 induced by type I IFNs. Next, the contribution of PRRSV toward SOCS1 production was examined using B18R. Porcine AMs were preincubated with B18R for 1 h and then inoculated with HN07-1 or poly(I:C), a TLR3 ligand triggering IFN production. At indicated time points, SOCS1 induction was measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. The upregulation of SOCS1 mRNA and proteins induced by PRRSV in B18R-treated cells was still maintained at high levels. However, the upregulation of SOCS1 mRNA and proteins induced by poly(I:C) was almost completely abolished by B18R (Fig. 3A, 3B). To further confirm this result, siRNA was used to knockdown the expression of IFNAR1 in porcine AMs. The knockdown efficiency of the siRNA, which is specific for silencing the IFNAR1 gene, as assessed by qRT-PCR, was \u223c61% (Fig. 3C). Despite partial IFNAR1 silencing, SOCS1 was still upregulated by PRRSV infection in porcine AMs to nearly the same degree, as in cells transfected with an NC siRNA (Fig. 3D, 3E). Similar results were obtained in Marc-145 cells (Fig. 3F, Supplemental Fig. 2G\u2013I). Taken together, these data demonstrated that PRRSV induced SOCS1 production independently of type I IFNs.",

To further clarify the mechanisms through which SOCS1 transcription was induced by PRRSV, several putative transcriptional regulatory elements were identified in the 59-flanking regions of the SOCS1 gene (shown in Supplemental Fig. 3A), using Proscan V1.7 and Promoter 2.0. The 59-flanking regions of porcine SOCS1 extending from nt 22000 to +100 relative to the transcription initiation site were cloned and inserted into a pGL4.17-basic reporter vector to generate the SOCS1 promoter reporter plasmid 22000/100Luc. Marc-145 cells were transfected with the 22000/100-Luc and pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, the transfected Marc-145 cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity. As shown in Supplemental Fig. 3B and 3C, the luciferase activity of the full-length 22000/100-Luc construct exhibited 33.3-fold and 22.3-fold increases over that of pGL4.17basic in Marc145 cells and CRL2843-CD163, respectively, indicative of the promoter activity of 22000/100-Luc.",

Briefly, 22000/ 100-Luc contained the full-length promoter region. The 21359/ 100-Luc excluded one CCAAT-box, one IRF3, one AP-2, and two Sp1 binding sites. The 2381/100-Luc contained two IRF3, two Sp1, and one AP-1 binding site. The 258/100-Luc only contained a TATA box on the reverse strand. Following transfection of Marc-145 cells and CRL2843-CD163 cells with these deletion mutants, luciferase activities were evaluated with or without PRRSV infection. The luciferase activities of the 2381/100-Luc mutants exhibited 1.8fold and 2.3-fold upregulation upon PRRSV infection, respectively, whereas other mutants did not (Fig. 4B, 4C).

The results show that PRRSV N protein induced the highest SOCS1 promoter activity (Fig. 5A, 5D), which was further confirmed by transfection of Marc-145 cells with an N protein expression vector. Following transfection, SOCS1 protein production was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B).",

            "Analysis with Proscan V1.7 and Promoter 2.0 revealed that five transcriptional regulatory elements, including two IRF3s binding sites (2308 to 2302, 2116 to 2111), two Sp1 binding sites (2188 to 2175, 2160 to 2151), and one AP-1 binding site (2104 to 296), were found in the 2381 to 258 region of the SOCS1 promoter (Fig. 6A). To identify the regulatory elements required for SOCS1 production, a series of mutants defective in each specific transcription regulatory element were prepared (2308DIRF3-Luc, 2188DSp1-Luc, 2160DSp1-Luc, 2116DIRF3-Luc, and 2104DAP-1-Luc). These mutants are shown schematically in Fig. 6A. Marc-145 cells were transfected with the deletion mutants for 24 h. The cells were then inoculated with HN07-1 for 24 h, and luciferase activities were measured. When compared with the wild-type 2381/100-Luc, all mutants exhibited low promoter activities (Fig. 6B). When the AP-1 binding site at position 2104 to 296 was deleted, the luciferase activity of the SOCS1 promoter (2104DAP-1-Luc) induced by PRRSV infection decreased to the same level as the control (pGL4.17-basic), a 55-fold decrease when compared with the intact 2381/100-Luc. Similar results were obtained when N protein was used as the stimulant (Fig. 6C). Also, similar results were obtained in CRL2843-CD163 cells (Fig. 6D, 6E).",

            "Because the AP-1 binding site in porcine SOCS1 was important for PRRSV-induced SOCS1 promoter activity, it was hypothesized that AP-1, the dimeric complex of c-Jun and c-Fos, might be involved in porcine SOCS1 induction during PRRSV infection. To test this hypothesis, porcine AMs were pretreated with a specific c-Jun inhibitor (SR11302) for 1 h prior to HN07-1 infection. Twentyfour hours later, SOCS1 mRNA expression was analyzed using qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 7A, SR11302 significantly inhibited SOCS1 induction by PRRSV in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxicity of the inhibitor was determined by a cell viability assay. No concentrations of the inhibitor caused detectable cell death in porcine AMs (Supplemental Fig. 4F) and Marc-145 cells (data not shown). The roles of c-Jun and c-Fos in PRRSV-induced SOCS1 production were confirmed by evaluating SOCS1 expression following the knockdown of c-Jun and c-Fos expression, using siRNA prior to PRRSV infection. The knockdown efficiencies of siRNAs were assessed using qRT-PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 7B, 7C). Knockdown of c-Jun and c-Fos significantly dampened SOCS1 mRNA and protein upregulation in porcine AMs (Fig. 7D, 7E). AP-1 inhibitor SR11302 also significantly decreased N protein\u2013induced SOCS1 production in Marc145 cells (Fig. 7F). Next, an investigation was carried out to determine whether AP-1 pathway was activated by PRRSV or the",

A similar extent of c-Jun phosphorylation was observed when Marc145 cells were transfected with an expression vector that encodes the PRRSV N protein (Fig. 7H). The level of phosphorylation of c-Fos in Marc-145 cells was difficult to detect. Taken together, these results indicate that both PRRSV and the N protein activate the AP-1 pathways, which was indispensable for SOCS1 production.",

At 24 hpi, c-Jun, c-Fos, phospho-c-Jun, and phospho-c-Fos levels were analyzed using Western blotting. The results obtained show that JNK inhibitor (SP600125) but not p38 inhibitor (SB203580) significantly impaired PRRSV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9A, 9D). Moreover, p38 inhibitor (SB203580) but not JNK inhibitor (SP600125) significantly impaired PRRSV-induced c-Fos and c-Fos phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9B, 9E). Both p38 inhibitor (SB203580) and JNK inhibitor (SP600125) dose-dependently inhibited PRRSV-induced SOCS1 production (Fig. 9C, 9F).

As shown in Fig. 9G and 9H, c-Jun phosphorylation induced by N protein was significantly impaired by JNK inhibitor (SP600125) but not p38 inhibitor (SB203580) in a dosedependent manner, suggesting that activation of c-Jun by PRRSV N protein was mediated by the JNK pathway. Meanwhile, PRRSV N protein\u2013induced SOCS1 expression was also significantly impaired by SP600125 (Fig. 9H).",

        "Discussion": [
            "To evade innate immune responses, viruses hijack cellular proteins to impair host immunity to establish persistent infection. In this study, it has been shown that PRRSV promoted self-replication through a mechanism involving SOCS1 induction. It was observed that PRRSV infection strongly induced SOCS1 production in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). SOCS1 upregulation by PRRSV was not fully dependent on type I IFNs but was involved in p38/AP-1 and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways (Figs. 7\u20139). Using luciferase reporter assays, the thought that PRRSV N protein might significantly upregulate SOCS1 expression was completely screened out (Fig. 5, Supplemental Fig. 4A\u2013E). It was further proven that NLS-2 of N protein played a critical role in SOCS1 promoter activation (Fig. 5). Taken together, the results of this study uncovered an unappreciated mechanism employed by PRRSV to suppress host immune response and enable efficient virus replication.",
            "Because PRRSV has a very narrow cellular tropism, with a preference for monocyte/macrophage lineage cells and particularly for porcine AMs in the lung [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>], the ability of PRRSV (including PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 species) to induce SOCS1 production in porcine AMs was first assessed. It was observed that all tested representative PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 strains (GZ11-G1, HN07-1, BJ-4, and HNhx) significantly upregulated SOCS1 production. However, the increase of SOCS1 in Marc-145 cells and CRL2843CD163 cells during PRRSV infection showed delayed effects (36 hpi), when compared with those in porcine AMs. The increase of SOCS1 in porcine AMs upon PRRSV-1 strain GZ11-G1 infection also showed a delayed effect (after 24 hpi), when compared with PRRSV-2 strain infection. These data suggest differences in SOCS1 expression among different cells or PRRSV strains. Moreover, SOCS1 expression during the early stages of PRRSV infection (3 hpi on porcine AMs or 6 and 12 hpi on Marc145 cells) exhibited slightly decreased effects (Fig. 1A, 1E). It was speculated that during early infection stage, when the first round of PRRSV replication remained incomplete, SOCS1 downregulation is a beneficial host response to PRRSV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>]. Indeed, SOCS1 upregulation requires PRRSV replication (Fig. 1I). SOCS1 functions as a crucial intracellular protein that negatively modulates innate and adaptive immunity. Most previous studies have demonstrated that SOCS1 mainly targets the JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Recent studies have presented direct evidence that SOCS1 downregulates type I IFN production [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. The results of this study indicate that SOCS1 not only suppressed IFN-b expression but also inhibited the expression of ISGs, which are stimulated by IFN (Supplemental Fig. 1). Several other proteins that act as negative regulators of immune response have been reported to be modulated by PRRSV infection. For example, IL-10, which is known to negatively regulate the production of numerous inflammatory cytokines, cell-mediated immune responses, and Ag presentation, was upregulated in PRRSV-infected porcine AMs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c68\" href=\"#r68\">68</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>]. Secretion of soluble CD83, which is involved in immunosuppression of T cell proliferation and differentiation, was strongly stimulated by PRRSV and PRRSV proteins (N and nsp10) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>]. Thus, it was speculated that all these factors caused a comprehensive and complex immunosuppressive environment in vivo during PRRSV infection, which together contribute to PRRSV replication and establishment of persistent infection. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of SOCS1 on IFN and whether PRRSV-induced SOCS1 upregulation acts on other signaling pathways need to be further elucidated. Indeed, PRRSV propagation was strongly enhanced by SOCS1 (Fig. 2). The results obtained in this study add a",
            "new dimension to scientific knowledge of the strategies used by PRRSV to antagonize type I IFN responses.",
            "The multifunctional PRRSV N protein is the most abundant viral protein in infected cells and is highly immunogenic in pigs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. The N protein was reported to be involved in induction of IL-10, IL-15, and regulatory T lymphocyte differentiation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>]. Moreover, the N protein suppressed IFN-b expression through inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>]. In this study, the results obtained show that PRRSV N protein could significantly activate SOCS1 promoter activity and induce SOCS1 expression at the protein level in Marc-145 cells (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that N protein also plays an important role in SOCS1 expression, reflecting a new function of this protein. However, viral 59 triphosphate RNA is reported to be the major transcriptional inducer of another SOCS family protein (SOCS3) and causes reduced STAT1 phosphorylation during influenza A virus infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. Further studies on the ability of viral RNAs to induce SOCS1 expression are needed.",
            "In the presence of B18R (which inhibits the activities of type I IFNs) or siRNAs (which silence IFNAR1 expression), the PRRSV still significantly induced SOCS1 upregulation in porcine AMs and Marc-145 cells (Fig. 3). Because B18R almost completely inhibited IFN-induced ISG expression and SOCS1 production, it was concluded that SOCS1 induction by PRRSV is hardly dependent on type I IFNs. The SOCS1 induction by PRRSV is a primary response, not a secondary effect induced by the secretion of IFN. However, the possibility that the induction of SOCS1 by PRRSV might minimally or partly depend on IFN signaling pathways cannot be ruled out. The results obtained in this study indicated that p38/AP-1 and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways were involved in PRRSV-induced SOCS1 production. JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway was involved in N protein\u2013induced SOCS1 production. Because the signaling pathways used for SOCS1 induction by PRRSV and N protein differed, it was speculated that other factors might have participated in the SOCS1 induction. Therefore, there is need for further investigation.",
            "In conclusion, to our knowledge, it has been reported in this article for the first time that PRRSV and PRRSV N protein are able to induce SOCS1 production, which is exploited by PRRSV to facilitate the replication of PRRSV through a molecular mechanism that involves AP-1 signaling pathway but not the autoregulatory action of type I IFNs. The findings of this study provide novel (to our knowledge) insights into the strategies employed by PRRSV to subvert the host immune response."

        "The expression kinetics of SOCS1 in several Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus-susceptible cells infected with different Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus strains were investigated",
        "Porcine alveolar macrophages were inoculated with Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus-2 strain HN07-1 at an multiplicity of infection of 1",
        "The cells were harvested at the indicated time points to quantify SOCS1 mRNA and protein levels using quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA",
        "The results show that Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus significantly upregulated SOCS1 mRNA levels at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi, with expression peaking at 12 hpi (11.5-fold, Fig. 1A)",
        "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection increased SOCS1 protein levels at 12, 24, and 36 hpi, with expression peaking at 36 hpi (Fig. 1B, 1C)",
        "Because monkeyderived Marc-145 cells and Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus-permissive CRL2843CD163 cells are typically used to study Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection in vitro, there was contemplation on the possibility of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus having the same impact on SOCS1 expression in both cell lines",
        "It was further proven that nuclear localization signal-2 of N protein played a critical role in SOCS1 promoter activation (Fig. 5)",
        "The results of this study uncovered an unappreciated mechanism employed by Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus to suppress host immune response and enable efficient virus replication"
