        "abstract": "This narrative is a personal view of adventures in genetic science and society that have blessed my life and career across five decades. The advances I enjoyed and the lessons I learned derive from educational training, substantial collaboration, and growing up in the genomics age. I parse the stories into six research disciplines my students, fellows, and colleagues have entered and, in some cases, made an important difference. The first is comparative genetics, where evolutionary inference is applied to genome organization, from building gene maps in the 1970s to building whole genome sequences today. The second area tracks the progression of molecular evolutionary advances and applications to resolve the hierarchical relationship among living species in the silence of prehistory. The third endeavor outlines the birth and maturation of genetic studies and application to species conservation. The fourth theme discusses how emerging viruses studied in a genomic sense opened our eyes to host\u2013pathogen interaction and interdependence. The fifth research emphasis outlines the population genetic\u2013based search and discovery of human restriction genes that influence the epidemiological outcome of abrupt outbreaks, notably HIV\u2013AIDS and several cancers. Finally, the last arena explored illustrates how genetic individualization in human and animals has improved forensic evidence in capital crimes. Each discipline has intuitive and technological overlaps, and each has benefitted from the contribution of genetic and genomic principles I learned so long ago from Drosophila. The journey continues.",

            "conceptual advances in molecular evolution have produced amazing insights and windows into the ancient evolutionary secrets of living species. Developed analytical algorithms of evolutionary theory and automated computer scripts allowed the construction of statistically robust phylogenies of living species. Many workers, including those in my own group, rapidly learned and applied four diverse but complementary philosophies to reconstruct the hierarchical history of species divergence and emergence. The methods had names: (a) numerical taxonomy-phenetic or distance-based methods; (b) cladistics or maximum parsimony methods; (c) maximum likelihood statistical approaches; and (d) Bayesian statistical methods. Today, evolutionary relationships of nearly all zoological groups have been solved with these tools and approaches (51).",
            "The clincher to the stunning result came when we surgically exchanged postage stamp\u2013sized pieces of skin graft between 14 unrelated cheetahs. The grafts were all accepted as if they were identical twins (71). Subsequently, we added additional measures that all pointed to the conclusion that the cheetah as a species displays 90\u201399% less overall variation than other cats or mammals in general (72). The latest affirmation of the cheetah\u2019s genetic impoverishment came from its whole genome sequence (38). The cheetah would become the poster-child species for the perils of severe population reduction, mating with close relatives, and shriveling genetic diversity, a prelude for extinction (60, 72).",

Although I might have preferred major league baseball or rock music if I were blessed with the required talent (I was not), my adventures and experience in science have more than exceeded my expectations. It is not just the rush of an important flashpoint discovery but the satisfaction of hearing of personal discoveries without any appropriation (not so necessary anyway), and the smile of seeing my own scientific philosophy and even temperament displayed when a former student delivers a science lecture advance.

            "This narrative is a personal view of adventures in genetic science and society that have blessed my life and career across five decades. The advances I enjoyed and the lessons I learned derive from educational training, substantial collaboration, and growing up in the genomics age. I parse the stories into six research disciplines my students, fellows, and colleagues have entered and, in some cases, made an important difference. The first is comparative genetics, where evolutionary inference is applied to genome organization, from building gene maps in the 1970s to building whole genome sequences today. The second area tracks the progression of molecular evolutionary advances and applications to resolve the hierarchical relationship among living species in the silence of prehistory. The third endeavor outlines the birth and maturation of genetic studies and application to species conservation. The fourth theme discusses how emerging viruses studied in a genomic sense opened our eyes to host\u2013pathogen interaction and interdependence. The fifth research emphasis outlines the population genetic\u2013based search and discovery of human restriction genes that influence the epidemiological outcome of abrupt outbreaks, notably HIV\u2013AIDS and several cancers. Finally, the last arena explored illustrates how genetic individualization in human and animals has improved forensic evidence in capital crimes. Each discipline has intuitive and technological overlaps, and each has benefitted from the contribution of genetic and genomic principles I learned so long ago from Drosophila. The journey continues.",

A second recollection, which raises the prospect that most biographies are apocryphal, is from a classic book written in 1982 entitled In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America\u2019s Best-Run Companies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The authors offered profiles of a handful of Fortune 500 company CEOs asking each for the secrets to their success in leading the world\u2019s most influential commercial institutions. The CEOs had detailed explanations and insightful reasons for their achievements.",
            "But then the authors interviewed deputies and managers of the companies\u2019 executives and got their view of the same question: \u201cWhat were the most definitive characteristics of the CEO\u2019s success?\u201d The opinions from these subordinates were equally descriptive and credible, but in nearly all cases very distinct from the reasons the CEOs themselves had mentioned. Why? Because the staff had the perspective of standing back over a decades-long career as observers and offered what they believed really made the difference. The CEOs had more cryptic, personal, and recent perspectives, influenced by their latest actions, challenges, and movements. Who was correct? Maybe both? Can I be so objective myself? I can only try.",
            "My own career was stimulating, complex, curious, and fascinating. As a geneticist, I am supposing that \u201cnature\u201d awarded to me some good useful aptitudes, but perhaps as important was the \u201cnurture\u201d component: the teachers, colleagues, students, extraordinary support, empirical opportunities, unanticipated discoveries, peer recognition, science culture, and a bit of good luck. To some, my history sounds simple, even routine: a PhD in Drosophila genetics; a postdoc at the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NCI-NIH); 40+ years of staying put; then capped off by a genome bioinformatics adventure in St. Petersburg, Russia. The editors of the Annual Review of Animal Biosciences have invited me to expand on my view of how it all came together. Because I was anything but focused on my research endeavors, my steps look chaotic and episodic. To help tell this narrative more clearly, I emphasize discrete genetic research disciplines that I became enamored with, for better or for worse, and tell the stories through a genomic lens.",

He began by building crystal radio sets in the late 1920s, and with but a high school diploma, he went on to build the CBS radio station and then the TV station in Rochester, where he became chief engineer. In my early youth, I paid little attention to science, being more interested in baseball, dogs, and rock and roll. My family relocated to Bethesda, Maryland, outside Washington, DC, in 1958, where I had a rather undistinguished high school performance that, to be frank, would limit my college admission opportunities. One thing I did enjoy in that period was singing and dancing in amateur high school musicals. Looking back, I suspect that these on-stage appearances provided terrific preparation in building confidence for public speaking later in the science arena.",
            "After hitchhiking 12 miles each day to Good Counsel High School in Wheaton, Maryland, I was excited to enter St. Francis College, a small liberal arts Catholic school run by Franciscan friars in the hills of western Pennsylvania. St. Francis was good for me. It protected me from my adolescent instincts, prejudices, and lack of career focus. The teachers were patient but demanding. I majored in biology and chemistry in a premedical track. My original plan was veterinary medicine, as I loved dogs and animals. But my dad advised me that the veterinary course was both rigorous and demanding, perhaps as much as medicine, so maybe I should consider medicine, because the payoff both culturally and financially could be more rewarding. The premed track I entered was not a perfect fit, and it showed from my transcripts. And then my life took a big turn.",
            "A young new professor at St. Francis, Dr. James Edwards, arrived to teach the emerging fields of genetics, evolutionary theory, and microbiology. Edwards lectured to small classes with extraordinary depth, insight, knowledge, and enthusiasm. His talks were sagas of the great discoveries in the beginnings of genetics and molecular biology. The characters were familiar: George Beadle, Barbara McClintock, Thomas Hunt Morgan, Calvin Bridges, Watson and Crick, Marshall Nirenberg, Jacob and Monod\u2014the list goes on. I was hooked. This was not about memorizing endless anatomical details or Latin names of countless plants or insects. Biology came alive in the details of transcription, translation, development, operons, gene maps, transfer RNAs, messenger RNAs, and empirical science design. A few students like me embraced it, devoured the excitement, and immersed ourselves into the field.",
            "I would remember a lesson from my father, when I asked him why he chose radio engineering as his profession that he did so well in. His response was, \u201cWell I was pretty good at it, but also the great advances and discoveries that were driving things forward in radio electronics were all accomplished by young, innovative, and aggressive engineering pioneers. I really wanted to meet them all.\u201d",
            "To me at that time, such a field was molecular biology and genetics. My academic performance skyrocketed. Edwards embraced and navigated my dream. As a determined mentor, he encouraged me to take summer courses in calculus and differential equations, then to elect a physical chemistry course in my senior year, top out in all of these, and apply to the best universities for graduate training in genetics. I did this and was accepted at half of the high-end schools to which I had applied. I chose a graduate fellowship at Cornell to work with Bruce Wallace, a well-known evolutionary geneticist and himself a student of the population genetics pioneer Theodosius Dobzhansky.

My first project, an empirical attempt to quantify overall genomic diversity in Drosophila populations with allozyme (allelic isozyme) variants, was successful, but my findings came in the wake of a report by Dick Lewontin and Jack Hubby (University of Chicago), who estimated that something like 30% of tested allozyme genes had electrophoretic variation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. After a few more population genetic reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], I developed a strong interest in functional genetics for genes of the \u03b1-glycerophosphate cycle, a component of energy metabolism in Drosophila flight muscle.

To me, gene mapping was a keystone to functional genetics; we desperately needed a catalog for the genes and mutational alterations that affected all things biological. Calvin Bridges and Alfred Sturtevant had initiated Drosophila genetic maps 50 years before using observable variant phenotypes (eye color, bristle patterns, and wing morphology). By the late 1960s, it was time to add molecular enzymes and proteins to these maps to connect genetics to the fast-moving and exciting new discipline of molecular biology.",

The discoveries of mammalian retroviruses were blossoming\u2014 scores of oncogenes were being uncovered by rescues from retroviral isolates from leukemias and sarcomas in chickens, mice, primates, and cats. Because I wanted to be part of this excitement, I would shift my postdoc from Baltimore to NCI in Bethesda to join a red-hot program headed by George Todaro, a truly brilliant biomedical researcher who among other things had formulated the term oncogene [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. I was hoping that my genetics and gene mapping background would offer a useful perspective.",
            "This hunch led to my developing somatic cell hybrid panels for mapping human genes. Frank Ruddle (Yale) and Tom Shows (Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York) had streamlined human mapping to an efficient process for mapping the first human molecular isozyme genes on human chromosomes. I learned from these two how to construct somatic cell hybrids and to definitively map human genes. Later ZooFISH (chromosome painting) techniques augmented the hybrid approach, along with the radiation hybrid (RH) mapping methods developed by David Cox (UCSF) and Peter Goodfellow (Cambridge). Applying these state-ofthe-art mapping technologies, the small group I was building at NCI was invited into more than 30 exciting collaborative studies to map the newest oncogenes, retroviral integration sites, tumor suppressor genes, and other gene determinants of cancer. Bill Nash, Bill Modi, Joan Menninger, and I participated in scores of gene assignments for new genes in the armament of cancer research.

I was intrigued by the retroviral advances in cancer research but felt an area that was lacking was uncovering variants in immune response genes, which regulate virus transmission and disease progression. I wanted to choose a nonhuman species with retroviral pathology to begin host genetic analyses. Four obvious models were considered: mice, cats, monkeys, and chickens. I excluded mice (too many great researchers there already), monkeys (too expensive and difficult to get numbers), and chickens (too evolutionarily distant from humans to be so relevant).

With a determined, perhaps misguided, interest in cats, we were not really considered as competitive to these pioneers.",
            "Our publication and subsequent expansion of the cat gene map made an important point in the emerging field of comparative genomics. Cat genes were organized into syntenic groups that were remarkably similar to the order of homologous genes on human chromosomes. Cats have 19 chromosome pairs, and humans have 23 pairs. Six of the chromosomes bore the same gene clusters in both species, and the other chromosomes had very few interchromosomal exchanges (called translocations). By 1990, ZooFISH and hybrid maps showed that one could rearrange the human gene syntenic segments into the cat gene order with as few as 13 scissor cuts or exchanges [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>].

We took on the task of comparing homologous gene orders and rearrangements among distantly related mammal species, all the while interpreting them in terms of the evolutionary and genomic determinants. This concept blossomed to become the Comparative Genomics discipline, which details the similarities in gene order and the fixed evolutionary rearrangements that preceded the origins of modern species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>].",
            "To promulgate this area, we needed precise and detailed gene maps of representative species of mammalian orders and families. As the human genome began to take shape, the importance of comparative data became crystal clear. In the 1980s, human gene mapping workshops kept up with the rapidly developing maps of each human chromosome. Indeed, the workshops had committees dedicated to human chromosome 1, to human chromosome 2, to human chromosome 3, to human chromosome 4...all the way to chromosome 23. Almost as an afterthought, our Comparative Committee was added to the group. The lead workers on gene mapping for mouse (Peter Lalley and Muriel Davisson), cow ( Jim Womack and Harris Lewin), horse (Ernie Bailey), pig (Larry Shook and Alan Archibald), kangaroo ( Jenny Graves), and cat (moi) agreed to build dense gene maps for each species and to compare the gene orders to impute translocation, inversion, and transposition rearrangements that punctuated genome evolution in mammals. The comparative community mapped genes, aligned the gene maps to different species, and included better gene mapping technologies [restriction fragment length polymorphism, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA markers of various sorts].",
            "In 1997, a group of us got together in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and designed a series of highly conserved PCR primers across the extensive human, mouse, and rat gene sequences, hoping to successfully amplify the gene homologs of cats, dogs, horses, pigs, and other nontraditional mammals. We called the markers comparative animal tagged sequence (or CATS) primers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>].

An initial full human genome sequence appeared in 2001 at an estimated cumulative cost of $2.7 billion, but questions about its meaning, organization, and interpretation were numerous and seemed to need an evolutionary perspective provided by comparative genome sequencing of related species. The NIH National Human Genome Research Institute staffed a committee (including myself) to select and fund light Sanger sequence of 32 diverse species of mammals for a lesser price of $2\u20133 million per species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>].

Dobzhansky [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>], considered by many the father of empirical population genetics, is well known for his quotation, \u201cNothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\u201d",

Since then, conceptual advances in molecular evolution have produced amazing insights and windows into the ancient evolutionary secrets of living species. Developed analytical algorithms of evolutionary theory and automated computer scripts allowed the construction of statistically robust phylogenies of living species. Many workers, including those in my own group, rapidly learned and applied four diverse but complementary philosophies to reconstruct the hierarchical history of species divergence and emergence. The methods had names: (a) numerical taxonomy-phenetic or distance-based methods; (b) cladistics or maximum parsimony methods; (c) maximum likelihood statistical approaches; and (d) Bayesian statistical methods. Today, evolutionary relationships of nearly all zoological groups have been solved with these tools and approaches [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>].",

My comparative colleagues and I put together a large wall chart that displayed the chromosomes of 30 mammals colored according to their homologous syntenic segments with the human genome [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>]. At the top of the poster was a consensus phylogenetic diagram to show the generally accepted phylogenetic or evolutionary hierarchy of the 18 recognized orders of placental mammals, compiled by a consensus of mammal molecular researchers and paleontological systematists. The colorful genome poster, summarizing the comparative inference to date, adorned the lab refrigerator doors of gene researchers across the world.",
            "But there was a catch. Our assessment of the consensus phylogenetic tree of mammals was a major stretch, made impossible because the morphologists and the molecular people could not agree at all on the hierarchy or the timing. At this stage, the research team that I directed, NCILGD (NCI\u2019s Laboratory of Genomic Diversity), spearheaded by Bill Murphy, Eduardo Eizirik, and Al Roca, reasoned that if we could use CATS primers to map genes, maybe we could design specific CATS primers to amplify genomic sequences of available species across mammals to resolve the mammal phylogeny using the molecular clock. Of the more than 100 CATS primers they designed, \u223c15 worked in 90% of the test species. Sadly, the rest failed owing to DNA drift across more than 100 million years of placental mammal evolution, but still we had enough to produce a first phylogenetic sampling and analysis across placental mammals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>].

Another fascinating example involves the well-known artificial selection experiment for tame behavior involving silver foxes, designed in 1959 by Dmitry Belyaev in Novosibirsk, Siberia.

One of the strongest and most influential of environmental components had to be the role of pathogens, notably viruses, bacteria, helminths, and parasites, that afflicted individuals, populations, and species. In nature, the delicate balance between hosts and their pathogens is akin to a deadly arms race, waged fiercely almost daily and multiplied over individuals, within populations, across geography, and among the more than 5,500 mammal species that survive on earth today. The struggle is frequently lost, never won, but temporarily circled with the survivors rising once again to compete another day.",

We now think the connection involved marauding Serengeti hyena packs that also developed CDV titers at around the same time. Hyenas, who rumble with both Maasai dogs and lions, became our best guess as the carriers of the CDV from Maasai dogs to Serengeti lions.

            "A lesson of host gene influence during viral outbreaks became crystal clear when the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic emerged in November 2002.

SARS was new to medicine, to science, and to people. In 9 months, SARS traveled to 29 countries, infected 8,098 people, and caused 774 deaths (near 10% mortality). The alarming speed of spread and virulence of transmission were dramatic. Consider that a single patient admission at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong transmitted to 112 cases within a few hours. A nearby sprawling Hong Kong apartment complex, Amory Gardens, home to 10,000 residents, developed 329 SARS cases after an infected woman coughed into the ventilation system. The condo became a ghost town within a few days.",

Although SARS subsided in May 2003, likely as a consequence of draconian quarantine measures, the deadly epidemic scared us all. Sixteen years later, we still have only a vague understanding of the precise mode of transmission, no laboratory-based clinical diagnosis, and no vaccine or efficacious treatment for SARS.

At the same wildlife park in Oregon where we had exchanged skin grafts between unrelated cheetahs, a pair of imported cheetahs from Sacramento arrived and grew ill with fevers, jaundice, and acute tremors. With little but symptomatic treatment, the two cheetahs deteriorated and succumbed to an unknown contagion. Biopsies and viral screening revealed they were infected with a domestic cat coronavirus called feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). In cats, FIPV induces an accumulation of proteinaceous immune complexes in the peritoneum that strangulates the organs, leading to death. The FIPV quickly spread through fecal transmission across the park, and within a few months all 60 cheetahs had seroconverted [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>]. By the time of the SARS outbreak (in 2003), newly available molecular tools allowed us to recover FIPV sequence from archival specimens to trace their origins. The cheetah virus was nearly indistinguishable from FIPV isolated from domestic cats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c98\" href=\"#r98\">98</a>]. Why is that important?",
            "The cheetahs\u2019 FIP morbidity (symptoms) was 100% (including chronic diarrhea, jaundice, and tremors), and 60% of the infected cheetahs died of the disease within three years.

This lesson I would never forget.",
            "A clear potential of the comparative inferences unfolding in my early scientific career was the hope to translate animal insights to human medicine. Our research group at NCI began a remarkable journey in the early 1980s when we looked for a chronic infectious disease that likely had host genetic components contributing to epidemiologic outcomes. We chose HIV\u2013AIDS as our target because the disease first emerged in 1981, clearly involved an infectious agent (HIV), and was deadly to 95% of its victims. We were hoping that the natural genetic variants, once unveiled, might lead to better diagnosis, to effective drugs, or even to prophylactic agents.",
            "After first consulting with human geneticists and AIDS experts and securing NCI financial support, we mounted a search for what we called AIDS-restriction genes, host genetic variants that influence epidemiologic heterogeneity among HIV-exposed individuals. We entered into collaborations with diligent epidemiologists, who were studying principal AIDS risk groups (actively gay men, hemophiliacs who received contaminated clotting factor before the advent of HIV screening in 1984, and IV drug users who were sharing contaminated hypodermic needles in urban settings). We sought to connect the clinical data documented by the epidemiology communities with DNA variants across the human genome as they were described by human geneticists and the fledgling human genome projects.",
            "To do this, we gathered blood samples from the at-risk cohort volunteers. Our strategy was to genotype large numbers of individuals in the AIDS cohort studies with DNA variants in candidate genes (those genes implicated as important in AIDS pathogenesis) for HIV infection, AIDS progression, AIDS-defining diseases (Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, lymphoma, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia), other clinical indicators of AIDS, and differential responses to available therapy (after 1996 termed HAART for highly active antiretroviral therapy). For detection, patients were parsed into groups with different disease outcomes so we could compare allele frequencies of variants between groups, as well as conformance to Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibria and other population genetic equilibria measures. When a certain gene allele showed higher frequency in one group versus another (e.g., HIV negative versus HIV positive), it was the first signal that the allele conferred resistance to HIV infection.",

We recruited nearly 20,000 patients, a rich repository for the discipline of genetic epidemiology. At NCI-LGD, Cheryl Winkler and Mary Eichelberger built a cell transformation laboratory that produced immortal B-cell lines using Epstein\u2013Barr virus transformation protocol from most of the blood samples. Raleigh Boaze extracted high molecular weight from each sample. I had hired Michael Dean, a superb young molecular biologist, to develop the human genotyping technology. Mike carried out the DNA genotyping for hundreds of gene candidates (Mary Carrington led the HLA and KIR typing effort), all in search of a statistically significant population genetic signal for AIDS influence.",

We would monitor new research advances that were reported in the AIDS literature, searching for new genes to test. Finally, 12 years after we had begun what was becoming a tedious, expensive, and thus far disappointing fishing expedition, there appeared a glimmer of hope [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c99\" href=\"#r99\">99</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c101\" href=\"#r101\">101</a>].",

HIV binds to two receptors on T-lymphoid cells, CCR5 and CD4, in a stepwise process to enter these cells and destroy them.

Looking back, my 50-year career allowed for five Scientific American articles, each on a different topic [cheetahs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>], giant pandas [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>], CCR5- 32 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c100\" href=\"#r100\">100</a>], Felidae natural history [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>] and the cat domestication process [137]]. In 2003, I published a semi-popular book, Tears of the Cheetah and Other Tales from the Genetic Frontier [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. Tears contained 14 science adventure stories stimulated by accounts of our work that had been featured in TV and newsprint media. Although these professional outlets made us look amazingly good, Tears allowed what I hoped was a more accurate and detailed narrative, because I lived the tales personally. I wrote Tears to explain our work to my mother; to my sister Carol, a folk singer; and to other interested nonscientists.",
            "The 14-year series of Genetic Maps, Vol I\u2013VI was undertaken to be a telephone book\u2013like compendium of genetic maps of all species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. The notion was successful, but it simply got too big, with the genome revolution unfolding, and yielded to scores of important web-based gene and DNA databases. In 2006, Bill Nash, Joan Menninger, and I decided to collect all the G-banded mammalian karyotype figures that were published (or not) and present them in a single Atlas of Mammalian Chromosomes [138]. In 2020, a dramatically updated version of the Atlas, edited by Alexander Graphodatsky, Polina Perelman, and myself, will appear with karyotypes of 1,020 species plus chromosome painting illustrations of comparative studies of evolutionary genome organization [139]. Lastly, my wife, Diane, reminds me that my 20-year tenure as editor of Journal of Heredity (1988\u20132008; published by the American Genetic Association, of which Diane was Managing Editor) clearly opened multiple doors and contacts that led to many new collaborations and dear friends."

        "CONCLUSIONS": [
            "So I doubt this treatise can be abridged in the 35 minutes Big Russ had allotted for his son. And I am certain that there are countless alternative views to be offered someday by dear friends, colleagues, and chroniclers. But this is my story told in my words. I do apologize to so many colleagues who have important roles but are unmentioned here. To me the ride was exhilarating, satisfying, and remarkably satisfactory. Although I might have preferred major league baseball or rock music if I were blessed with the required talent (I was not), my adventures and experience in science have more than exceeded my expectations. It is not just the rush of an important flashpoint discovery but the satisfaction of hearing of personal discoveries without any appropriation (not so necessary anyway), and the smile of seeing my own scientific philosophy and even temperament displayed when a former student delivers a science lecture advance. As I traveled across the globe, tracking lions, pandas, whales, and sick people, I worked with impressive, dedicated people and tried to help them out through science.",
            "My closing parable relates to why I enjoy the extraordinary science experts I encounter so frequently. Folk singer Harry Chapin once interviewed a hero of his, country singer Pete Seeger. Harry asked Pete how he felt after all these years being involved in social activism. Seeger paused, leaned back in his chair, and drawled slowly, \u201cHarry, my involvement in these causes, benefits, marches, demonstrations\u2014I\u2019m not sure they made a difference...\u201d",
            "Pete was being modest, because for 40 years he had stood up for every major issue of his time, embracing human rights and fighting fascism, Nazis, and racism starting in the late 1930s and 1940s. He continued, www.annualreviews.org \u2022 A Beautiful Life 17",
            "But I can tell you one thing. Involvement with these issues means you are involved with the good people, people with live hearts, live eyes and live heads... Just think about it in terms of your lives. Who are the people who are your best friends? Who are the people you keep coming back to? Who are the people that make your life worthwhile?...Usually they are the people who are committed to something. So in the final analysis commitment, in and of itself\u2014irrespective of whether you win or not, is something that truly makes your life worthwhile.",
            "So many times across my life I have embraced this precise emotion in pursuit of important science queries. I have been graced to work and interact with the precise people \u201cwith live hearts, live eyes and live heads.\u201d Certainly scientists discuss, argue, clash, and compromise with their colleagues. We may not always agree or succeed, but we certainly have tried to hit the highest possible standard. My dad urged me to meet all the innovators in my field, as Pete Seeger wanted to befriend the prescient pathfinders. I have been privileged to do both, one day at a time across so many years. To me, that may be the essence of a wonderful life and an exciting science career."

            "Looking back, it seems clear that my career meanderings were blessed with special opportunities, gifted students, fellows, colleagues, and benevolent supporters. I cannot mention them all, but I am grateful to each. Nearly all discoveries derive from countless interactions with my terrific graduate students (N \u223c 20), postdoctoral fellows (>30), dedicated lab and office staff, prescient collaborators, dear colleagues, and friends (http://dobzhanskycenter.spbu.ru/images/pdf/SJO-CVJune-16-2019.pdf ). I employ the royal \u201cwe\u201d in several spots to emphasize that the triumphs I enjoyed are theirs, with myself as a cheerful grateful add-on. The employment support and comfort I received from the US National Cancer Institute\u2013National Institutes of Health (NIH) (1971\u2013 2011); the Theodosius Dobzhansky Center in St. Petersburg, Russia (2012\u20132019); and Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (2013\u20132019), were the bedrock of my work across the years.",
            "For my initial inspiration, my teachers James Edwards, Ross MacIntyre, Bruce Wallace, and Theodosius Dobzhansky deserve special mention. Support from largely government moneys was paramount in my success. I enjoyed an NIH training grant for my graduate education at Cornell. The NCI-NIH provided a hefty budget as several wonderful scientist-administrators believed in me and steered resources to my discretion. Dick Adamson, Richard Klaussner, George VandeWoude, Tony Fauci, George Todaro, and Robert Gallo deserve special thanks. I could not have done this well without their encouragement and cheerful support. So important in my reminiscence are the joys, laughter, support, and love I received from my family\u2014Diane, the steady, cheerful, happy lifetime partner, and Kirsten and Meghan, my daughters, who taught me humility and caution and to set all my goals and standards so very, very high.",
