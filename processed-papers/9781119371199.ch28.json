Of the numerous protozoans known from chickens, turkeys, and gamebirds, only a few flourish under commercial conditions. Parasites with short, direct life cycles, such as coccidiosis, are favored, whereas others involving intermediate hosts are normally not a problem in poultry. An exception is blackhead disease (histomoniasis), which has a complicated life cycle involving intermediate hosts, but takes advantage of reservoir hosts (chickens) and is able to spread easily from bird to bird within a flock of turkeys. Diagnostic tools for protozoan diseases in poultry have been developed, particularly with coccidia and Histomonas. Polymerase chain reaction\u2010based tests are often used in research and may be useful to confirm species diagnosis. Knowing the route and source of protozoan infection is an important factor in developing biosecurity measures to decrease potential encounter with the bird and to break the parasites life cycle.",
