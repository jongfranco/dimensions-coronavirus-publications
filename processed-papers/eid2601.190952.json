            "Influenza D virus (IDV; family Orthomyxoviridae) is one of the possible bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) causative agents. IDVs are detected in and isolated from cattle in many countries in North America, Asia, Europe, and Africa [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. In addition, both IDV RNAs and specific antibodies have been detected in many animal species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. To date, IDVs have been phylogenetically classified into 3 lineages: D/OK, D/660, and Japanese lineages. We isolated a new IDV strain from cattle in Japan with respiratory disease, whose hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) gene did not belong to the known phylogenetical lineages.",
            "At a herd in Yamagata Prefecture in northern Japan, 15 Holsteins (37.5% of bred cattle in the herd) had respiratory signs develop during January 6\u201310, 2019 (Appendix Table 1, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/ EID/article/26/1/19-1092-App1.pdf). We collected nasal swab samples from 9 of 15 cows on January 7 and 10. All samples subjected to IDV-specific realtime reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] were found positive. We also subjected these samples to RT-PCR analyses specific for bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and 2, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine rhinitis A virus, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycoplasma bovigenitalium, Mycoplasma dispar, Ureaplasma diversum, and Mycoplasma bovirhinis. All samples were found negative for these pathogens except for the sample from cow no. 5, which was positive for M. dispar.
