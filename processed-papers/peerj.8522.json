        "abstract": "Background\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in gene regulators in many biological and molecular phenomena. Unraveling the involvement of miRNA as a key cellular factor during in vitro canine parvovirus (CPV) infection may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates. However, the examination of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated.\n\n\nMethod\nIn the present study, we utilized high-throughput small RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) technology to investigate the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries from uninfected (Control) and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney cells.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified five of known miRNAs (miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-1247-3p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) and three novel miRNAs (Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102) by sRNA-seq with differentially expressed genes in the miRNA repertoire of CPV-infected cells over control. We further predicted the potential target genes of the aforementioned miRNAs using sequence homology algorithms. Notably, the targets of miR-1247-3p exhibited a potential function associated with cellular defense and humoral response to CPV. To extend the probing scheme for gene targets of miR-1247-3p, we explored and performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of its target genes. We discovered 229 putative targets from a total of 38 enriched GO terms. The top over-represented GO enrichment in biological process were lymphocyte activation and differentiation, marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, negative regulation of programed cell death, and negative regulation of signaling. We next constructed a GO biological process network composed of 28 target genes of miR-1247-3p, of which, some genes, namely BCL6, DLL1, GATA3, IL6, LEF1, LFNG and WNT1 were among the genes with obviously intersected in multiple GO terms.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe miRNA-1247-3p and its cognate target genes suggested their great potential as novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic biomarkers of CPV or other related viruses.",

            "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in gene regulators in many biological and molecular phenomena. Unraveling the involvement of miRNA as a key cellular factor during in vitro canine parvovirus (CPV) infection may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates. However, the examination of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated. Method: In the present study, we utilized high-throughput small RNA-seq (sRNAseq) technology to investigate the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries from uninfected (Control) and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney cells. Results: We identified five of known miRNAs (miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR1247-3p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) and three novel miRNAs (Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102) by sRNA-seq with differentially expressed genes in the miRNA repertoire of CPV-infected cells over control. We further predicted the potential target genes of the aforementioned miRNAs using sequence homology algorithms. Notably, the targets of miR-1247-3p exhibited a potential function associated with cellular defense and humoral response to CPV. To extend the probing scheme for gene targets of miR-1247-3p, we explored and performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of its target genes. We discovered 229 putative targets from a total of 38 enriched GO terms. The top over-represented GO enrichment in biological process were lymphocyte activation and differentiation, marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, negative regulation of programed cell death, and negative regulation of signaling. We next constructed a GO biological process network composed of 28 target genes of miR-1247-3p, of"

Unraveling the involvement of miRNA as a key cellular factor during in vitro canine parvovirus (CPV) infection may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates. However, the examination of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated. Method: In the present study, we utilized high-throughput small RNA-seq (sRNAseq) technology to investigate the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries from uninfected (Control) and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney cells. Results: We identified five of known miRNAs (miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR1247-3p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) and three novel miRNAs (Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102) by sRNA-seq with differentially expressed genes in the miRNA repertoire of CPV-infected cells over control. We further predicted the potential target genes of the aforementioned miRNAs using sequence homology algorithms. Notably, the targets of miR-1247-3p exhibited a potential function associated with cellular defense and humoral response to CPV. To extend the probing scheme for gene targets of miR-1247-3p, we explored and performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of its target genes. We discovered 229 putative targets from a total of 38 enriched GO terms. The top over-represented GO enrichment in biological process were lymphocyte activation and differentiation, marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, negative regulation of programed cell death, and negative regulation of signaling. We next constructed a GO biological process network composed of 28 target genes of miR-1247-3p, of",

        "INTRODUCTION": [
            "Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a common cause of viral enteritis in puppies with high morbidity and mortality. The virus has a wide host range in many mammalian families, including dogs, cats, ferrets, minks and raccoons (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKapil_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rKapil_et+al_2007_a\">Kapil et al, 2007</a>). CPV is a non-enveloped virus, single-stranded DNA virus in the Parvoviridae family (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCotmore_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rCotmore_et+al_2014_a\">Cotmore et al, 2014</a>). The compact genome (approximately 5,000 nt) encodes two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) and three capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) through an alternative splicing of the same mRNAs (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBerns_2007_a\" href=\"#rBerns_2007_a\">Berns & Parrish, 2007</a>). CPV is globally distributed, and this virus has been evolutionarily diverged from CPV-1 to its present forms of CPV-2 subtypes; CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTruyen_2006_a\" href=\"#rTruyen_2006_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTruyen_2006_a\" href=\"#rTruyen_2006_a\">Truyen, 2006</a></a>). CPV-2 can cause severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in dogs, owing to amino acid substitutions harboring at VP2 capsid protein (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTruyen_2006_a\" href=\"#rTruyen_2006_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTruyen_2006_a\" href=\"#rTruyen_2006_a\">Truyen, 2006</a></a>).",
            "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, produced within the nuclei from miRNA gene transcription. The miRNA biogenesis starts with a long nucleotide sequences of the miRNAs which are folded into hairpin configuration, known as \u201cprimary miRNAs or pri-miRNAs\u201d. Later on, the shortening and editing of pri-miRNAs occurred by the activity of Drosha and DGCR9 enzymes, making a shorter version of miRNAs and soon to be called \u201cpre-miRNA\u201d. The pre-miRNA, an ~70-nucleotide in length, is exported to the cytosol where the Dicer repeatedly chops the sequences once again here to make an ~20-bp miRNA/miRNA\u00c3 duplex (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKrol_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rKrol_et+al_2010_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKrol_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rKrol_et+al_2010_a\">Krol, Loedige & Filipowicz, 2010</a></a>). The functional miRNA, ~18\u201322 nt long, represents a mature miRNA, which can be incorporated into the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). The miRNAs, altogether with its cognate target mRNAs, function as gene expression regulators as part of miRISC by preventing protein translation, mRNA deadenylation, and mRNA target cleavage (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKrol_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rKrol_et+al_2010_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKrol_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rKrol_et+al_2010_a\">Krol, Loedige & Filipowicz, 2010</a></a>).",
            "MicroRNAs play a pivotal role in many biological and molecular phenomena. Some miRNAs are involved in the regulation of genes related to the specific process in mammalian cells, such as cell differentiation, cell migration, cell signaling, various pathologies and apoptosis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBartel_2004_a\" href=\"#rBartel_2004_a\">Bartel, 2004</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKrol_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rKrol_et+al_2010_a\">Krol, Loedige & Filipowicz, 2010</a>). Some particular miRNAs may have a universal function during virus establishment and infections. Understanding the involvement of host factors in virus infection, modulated by miRNAs, may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates, that is, therapeutic silencing of miR-122 in chronic hepatitis C virus infection (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHenke_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rHenke_et+al_2008_a\">Henke et al, 2008</a>).",

Furthermore, miRNAs have great potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. However, the change of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated.",

In the present study, we performed and utilized high throughput approach via miRNA-seq experiments to identify the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries of uninfected and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells. Among miRNA repertoire retrieved from sequencing libraries, we would expect to see a dramatic expression of many miRNAs, but interestingly, miR-1247-3p appears to be one associated with cellular and humoral host defense response to CPV. At this point, there is little or nothing known about miR-1247 regarding its functionality related to CPV or other viruses. In this report, we have identified the targets of miR-1247-3p, along with other miRNAs; miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p, in CRFK cell infected with CPV-2c.

In RNA-seq, replicates have two main advantages. First, they demonstrate whether the experiment is repeatable, and secondly, they can reveal differences in gene expression between samples. The correlation between samples is an important indicator for testing the reliability of the experiment. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1, the greater the similarity of the samples. ENCODE suggests that the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient should be larger than 0.92, under ideal experimental conditions (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2004). In this project, the R2 were larger than 0.93 (Fig. 3A). Variations among technical replicates were minimal. These observations can also be confirmed by the correlation matrix. For Pearson correlation, the correlation coefficient within group and between groups were larger than 0.92 demonstrating that the experiment was repeatable, and could be revealed differences in gene expression between samples (Fig. 3A).",

To reduce the complexity of data for interpretation (n = 420, mapped mature miRNAs), we have performed and used the dimension reduction algorithm t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to review our miRNA expression data (Fig. 3C). Because of high-dimensional datasets, this technique can be implemented, allowing it to be applied to large real-world datasets, resulting in well suited for the easy visualization.

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "The outbreak and spread of the novel CPV-2 variant to Lao PDR (CPV-2c) have caused many significant health impacts on the dogs. The current dominated CPV Laotian strain (CPV-2c) has got the best fit in the animal resided in the urban environment, specifically, Vientiane capital of Laos (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVannamahaxay_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rVannamahaxay_et+al_2017_a\">Vannamahaxay et al, 2017</a>). To the best of our knowledge, CPV-2c is now reported globally as being more virulent than endemically strains. The alternation of amino acid at residue 426 (designated as CPv-2c) may play a critical role in pathogenicity of this virus. Based on the existing literatures and our additional findings, we speculated that the changes in miRNA gene expressions in the hosts infected with parvovirus family (e.g., CPV, MEV, FPV) would have the same but not identical pattern of miRNA expression (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSun_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rSun_et+al_2014_a\">Sun et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2017_a\">Zhou et al, 2017</a>).",
            "Introducing the next-generation sequencing technology, specifically, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has transformed the comprehensive measuring gene expression across the transcriptome, including small and miRNAs (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLagan\u00e0_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rLagan\u00e0_et+al_2017_a\">Lagan\u00e0 et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSun_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rSun_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSun_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rSun_et+al_2014_a\">Sun et al, 2014</a></a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2017_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2017_a\">Zhou et al, 2017</a></a>). This reliable platform with a high-throughput and powerful tool guarantees the enormous gene study. Across all RNA species, RNA-seq has revolutionized and become a widely used approach to study quantitative aspects of transcriptome profiling in the virus-infected cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2019_a\">Li et al, 2019</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSun_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rSun_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSun_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rSun_et+al_2014_a\">Sun et al, 2014</a></a>, 2019; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2017_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2017_a\">Zhou et al, 2017</a></a>). In the current study, we have explored the miRNA milieu in CRFK cells infected with CPV-2c Laotian isolates (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPuentes_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rPuentes_et+al_2012_a\">Puentes et al, 2012</a>). We have identified 515 DEGs using sRNA libraries in either uninfected control or CPV-infection. In the literatures, CRFK cell line has been extensively characterized for its use as a standard model system to investigate CPV infection (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRaj_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rRaj_et+al_2010_a\">Raj et al, 2010</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYi_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rYi_et+al_2016_a\">Yi et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYoshikawa_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rYoshikawa_et+al_2010_a\">Yoshikawa et al, 2010</a>), but miRNA sequencing platform in CRFK cells had not been previously reported or studied.",
            "In genomics era, we have a chance to execute our aims to analyze large datasets from CRFK samples from CPV individuals using sRNA-seq data to enumerate, quantify, assess and comprehend the heterogeneity of DEGs during in vitro experimental CPV infection. Compared to recent evidence reported by Sun and coworkers (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSun_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rSun_et+al_2014_a\">Sun et al, 2014</a>), they extensively analyzed the DEGs from miRNA-seq data of the MEV in feline kidney (F81) cell line. They have identified 196 known mammalian miRNAs in their report. Similar to our findings, we have found more known miRNAs in CPV-infected CRFK cells (420 of known miRNAs). Additionally, in MEV-infected cells, they found a minimal number of miRNAs that significantly down-regulated (miR-181b, miR-181d and miR-301) and up-regulated (miR-29b, miR-125b and miR-320a). Consistent with our results, we pinpointed of about three miRNAs that significantly up-regulated in CPV infection (miR-222-5p, miR-1247-3p and miR-365-5p) whereas many more miRNAs were significantly down-regulated (miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) including Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102 miRNAs. The differences in miRNA species found by two studies reflect the effects of various factors, for example, the virus and cell line used in the studies, which makes it very difficult to compare the results side by side.",
            "Our current CPV bioinformatic aspects revealed the correlation of CPV miRNA-seq data has a larger dynamic range of its target genes. Within five preferential miRNAs with significant DEGs (miR-222-5p, miR1247-3p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p), we have identified more than 3,000 target genes. In CRFK infected cells, the gene targets of significant miRNA DEGs functionally belong to immune response (e.g., lymphocyte activation and antibody production), cell communication and signaling, cytokine production, and lastly cell death. Consistent with our results, a similar relevance of gene network in the signaling pathways of virus-host interaction was reported by <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFan_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rFan_et+al_2016_a\">Fan et al (2016</a>) in CPV-2a infected MDCK cells. In Zhou et al (2017), the genes pertaining metabolism-related pathways, cytokine- and pathogen-host interaction-related pathway were affected in feline parvovirus (FPV) infected cats.",
            "Our initial screening of DEGs defined the three most significant upregulated miRNA genes were miR-222-5p, miR-1247-3p and miR-365-2-5p. Of particular interests in immunological response to the virus, miR-1247-3p had roughly 229 target genes, whose function can be categorized into 33 GO by GO enrichment analysis (GO biological process term). The miRNA-1247-3p function is estimated to modulate at least 200 genes, involving in 38 GO biological processes (BP) plus molecular function (MF) due to the redundancy with partial target recognition. As stated earlier, miRNA-1247-3p could, at least, be regulated 28 functional genes in our reports, but the actual numbers would be much higher. Our findings in CPV-infection reveal an exceptional function of miR-1247-3p in response to virus, other than the functions as onco-miRNA and controlling of cartilage function (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFang_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rFang_et+al_2018_a\">Fang et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMartinez-Sanchez_2013_a\" href=\"#rMartinez-Sanchez_2013_a\">Martinez-Sanchez & Murphy, 2013</a>).",
            "The functional genes in the GO process can be overlapping at certain points in the pathway, though this was obviously modulated by miR-1247-3p in this study. For example, we found that genes: ABL1, ADA, BAX, BCL3, BCL6, BMI1, BMP4, CTNNB1, DLL1, GATA3, GLI3, IL6, LEF1, NLRP3, PSEN1, SFRP1, SOCS5, WNT1, XBP1 can be partially intersected in lymphocyte activation involved in immune response, lymphocyte differentiation, negative regulation of cell communication, and negative regulation of cell death pathways. When many affected genes by miRNAs have converged, it will be amplified the signals or expansion of its functions to adjacent gene network. The synergism among genes within GO biological processes in reacting to virus infections, as anticipated in CPV as well, is a common paradigm for effective host defense response. Of the thirty-three GO process categories discovered in the current study, IL-6 was remarkably important cytokine, as a key for marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, and lymphocyte differentiation, by its action (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSafi_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rSafi_et+al_2017_a\">Safi et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhou_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rZhou_et+al_2018_a\">Zhou et al, 2018</a>).",
            "This work has highlighted the importance of some potential miRNAs and their target functional, relevant genes in controlling and mitigating immune response to CPV virus. Whilst most analyzed miRNAs in our findings remained unchanged (430 miRNAs) due to their minimal roles in response to virus, some are apparently shedding light on the role of the manipulating of several GO pathways. The miR-1247-3p, accompanying by other significant DEGs, as earlier discussed, can be linked to further experimental observations, leading directions for further work and implication for clinical use."

        "CONCLUSIONS": [
            "We have identified the DEGs in the miRNA repertoire during CPV-2c infection of CRFK cells. Our work revealed that the miRNA-1247-3p and its cognate target genes in biological pathways highlight their great potential as novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic biomarkers of CPV infection.",
