            "A novel coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV, by the World Health Organization, is identified as the cause for an outbreak of viral pneumonia first detected in Wuhan city of China and it continues to spread throughout the world (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPerlman_2020_a\" href=\"#rPerlman_2020_a\">Perlman, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhu_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZhu_et+al_2020_a\">Zhu et al, 2020</a>). These viruses have a characteristic \u201ccrown\u201d structures observed by electron microscopy and are classified under the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales. The coronavirus genome is composed of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of about 30Kb, which is the largest non-segmented genome among known RNA viruses. It can cause respiratory, digestive, and nervous system diseases in humans and animals (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHilgenfeld_2013_a\" href=\"#rHilgenfeld_2013_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHilgenfeld_2013_a\" href=\"#rHilgenfeld_2013_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHilgenfeld_2013_a\" href=\"#rHilgenfeld_2013_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHilgenfeld_2013_a\" href=\"#rHilgenfeld_2013_a\">Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013</a></a></a></a>). Initially, few cases of viral pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, in December 2019, and most of the patients affected had visited a common local seafood and animal market, which suggested animal-to-person transmission (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2020_a\">Huang et al, 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2020_a\">Wang et al, 2020</a>). However, it was later reported that a growing number of patients did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating that a person-to-person spread is occurring (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChan_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rChan_et+al_2020_a\">Chan et al, 2020</a>).

            "To date, many problems remain to be solved, including the virus\u2019 origin, extent, and duration of transmission in humans, its ability to infect animal hosts, its spectrum and pathogenesis of human infections, and an effective vaccine development.",
            "At the heart of vaccine development is the question of immunology and it is crucial to understand the immunological questions associated with viral infections. The clinical characteristics and treatment of 2019-nCoV and SARS both suggested a serious problem of immunopathology, particularly in the lung mucosa, which is complex and unique. It might be due to the fact that a systematic protective immune response is not enough to protect against viral infection. Currently, one of the most dangerous but valuable experiments is to perform tests on immune cells in the blood and lungs of infected patients, preferably during different stages of viral infection. Data on clinical immunity can lay the foundation for future vaccine development. We need to be aware of the challenges and concerns that 2019-nCoV poses to our community. Every effort should be made to understand and control the disease.",
