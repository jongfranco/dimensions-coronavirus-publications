        "abstract": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a typical neurotropic coronavirus that mainly invades the central nervous system (CNS) in piglets and causes vomiting and wasting disease. Emerging evidence suggests that PHEV alters microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles, and miRNA has also been postulated to be involved in its pathogenesis, but the mechanisms underlying this process have not been fully explored. In this study, we found that PHEV infection upregulates miR-142a-3p RNA expression in N2a cells and in the CNS of mice. Downregulation of miR-142a-3p by an miRNA inhibitor led to a significant repression of viral proliferation, implying that it acts as a positive regulator of PHEV proliferation. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, miR-142a-3p was found to bind directly bound to the 3\u2019 untranslated region (3\u2019UTR) of Rab3a mRNA and downregulate its expression. Knockdown of Rab3a expression by transfection with an miR-142a-3p mimic or Rab3a siRNA significantly increased PHEV replication in N2a cells. Conversely, the use of an miR-142a-3p inhibitor or overexpression of Rab3a resulted in a marked restriction of viral production at both the mRNA and protein level. Our data demonstrate that miR-142a-3p promotes PHEV proliferation by directly targeting Rab3a mRNA, and this provides new insights into the mechanisms of PHEV-related pathogenesis and virus-host interactions.",

            "In summary, the biological significance of miR-142a-3pmediated Rab3a suppression and the underlying mechanisms of the response to PHEV infection remain to be elucidated. Although some host miRNAs execute antiviral functions by limiting viral infection in cells, it is still debatable whether an miR-142a-3p antagonist could be used as a potential antiviral therapy against PHEV infection in the physiological context. Much more work in this area still needs to be done in the future."

The level of miR142a-3p RNA was then determined by qRT-PCR, and we found that its relative expression was significantly increased, up to 5.60-fold at 48 hpi (Fig. 1a). Three-weekold male BALB/c mice were inoculated with 100 \u03bcL of PHEV \u00ad(104.45 \u00adTCID50/0.1 mL) by the intranasal route, and their brain tissues were harvested at 3 and 5 dpi. As shown in Fig. 1b, the expression of miR-142a-3p RNA was upregulated by 4.70-fold at 5 dpi in PHEV-infected mice. To determine whether change in miR-142a-3p expression correlate with PHEV infection, qRT-PCR assays were used to measure replication of the PHEV genome in infected N2a cells and mice (Fig. 1c and d). The results showed that viral replication increased in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that miR-142a-3p expression during PHEV infection is possibly associated with PHEV proliferation."

            "miRNAs are ~22-nt ncRNAs that play essential roles in complex virus-host interactions at the posttranscriptional level [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. The specific target mRNA is principally recognized by the seed region of miRNAs, though multiple validated targets lack perfect base-pairing interactions. miRNA target sequences could be involved in the control of exogenous gene expression and viral tropism in specific cells or tissues, and miRNA-based therapeutics might be designed to either restore or suppress the function of dysregulated miRNAs. Given the versatility and importance of miRNAs, both DNA and RNA viruses affect host pathways by destroying, boosting, or hijacking miRNAs to benefit the viral life cycle [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. In the case of PHEV, a highly neuropathic virus, little is known about how miRNAs participate in its infection and pathological process.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection upregulates miR-17*, mir574-5p, and miR-214 and inhibits the expression of miR-98 and miR-223. miR-17* and mir-574-5p have been shown to restrict the replication of SARS-CoV, whereas miR-214 contributes to immune escape [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. miRNAs are processed from hairpin transcripts, and this maturation step gives rise to a 3p and a 5p strand, both of which allow the silencing of specific target genes through base pairing to a minimal recognition sequence [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. The miR-142(a) hairpin gives rise to a \u201cguide strand\u201d, miR-142(a)-3p, and a sister \u201cpassenger strand\u201d, miR-142(a)-5p [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. miR-142a-3p has been sown to play a critical role in virus infection, inflammation, and immune tolerance.

The data show that miR-142a-3p may be upregulated by PHEV and promote viral replication by directly targeting Rab3a.

The specific target mRNA is principally recognized by the seed region of miRNAs, though multiple validated targets lack perfect base-pairing interactions. miRNA target sequences could be involved in the control of exogenous gene expression and viral tropism in specific cells or tissues, and miRNA-based therapeutics might be designed to either restore or suppress the function of dysregulated miRNAs. Given the versatility and importance of miRNAs, both DNA and RNA viruses affect host pathways by destroying, boosting, or hijacking miRNAs to benefit the viral life cycle [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>].

Moreover, our data revealed that enrichment of miR-142a-3p could promote PHEV infection or propagation and that knockdown of miR-142a-3p had an opposite effect. We therefore concluded that miR-142a-3p could affect PHEV accumulation and might also play a specific role in PHEV pathogenesis. More follow-up work is needed to support this view.",
            "How might miR-142a-3p play a role during PHEV infection? Sequencing, bioinformatics, and time course experiments indicated that miR-142a-3p directly targets the Rab3a mRNA 3\u2032UTR. Rab3a is a small G protein that belongs to the RAS family of proteins. It regulates vesicle trafficking and is involved in calcium-triggered exocytosis in nerve cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. Generally, Rab3a protein localizes to the Golgi complex and regulates the synthesis and transport of effectors by interacting with GTPase [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Given that",
            "PHEV buds from endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartments and is assembled within small vesicles in the trans-Golgi network, we hypothesize that Rab3a, a Golgi-associated protein, may acts as a regulator of PHEV replication or nucleocapsid assembly [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, 32]. In this study, we found that Rab3a deficiency promotes PHEV replication and propagation, while overexpression of Rab3a restricts virus proliferation. Thus, we draw the preliminary conclusion that, in some phase of PHEV infection, Rab3a functions as a negative regulator through base-pairing interactions with miR-142a-3p.",
            "In summary, the biological significance of miR-142a-3pmediated Rab3a suppression and the underlying mechanisms of the response to PHEV infection remain to be elucidated. Although some host miRNAs execute antiviral functions by limiting viral infection in cells, it is still debatable whether an miR-142a-3p antagonist could be used as a potential antiviral therapy against PHEV infection in the physiological context. Much more work in this area still needs to be done in the future."
