            "As of this report date, more than 20 pediatric cases have been reported in China. Zhejiang Province has the biggest number of pediatric cases (10), because of earlier and wider application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection of clinical samples. All the ten pediatric patients, of age from 112 days to 17 years, are mild cases, and only three showed pneumonia. Based on the current data in pediatric cases, this recommendation focuses on pediatric respiratory infections caused by 2019-nCoV, not pneumonia only. To make it more helpful for first-line clinicians to judge patients\u2019 conditions, this recommendation is detailed in physical examinations, systemic symptoms, and clinical classifications, particularly in the definition of severe and critical cases. Since most pediatric cases are family clusters, a history of close contact with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV within 2 weeks prior to disease onset should be paid more attention to. Meanwhile, The current recommendation highlights the different clinical characteristics of pediatric patients, and provides optimized, detailed and applicable standards for clinical practice. Due to the limited pediatric cases and experiences, this recommendation is formulated mainly based on the standards and experiences in adult patients. With further case data collection and accumulated experiences in managing pediatric cases infected by 2019-nCoV, this recommendation will be updated and improved. With stringent prevention and control strategies, we believe we can win the fight against this epidemic."
