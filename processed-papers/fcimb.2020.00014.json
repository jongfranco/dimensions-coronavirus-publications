        "abstract": "Temperate phages are considered as natural vectors for gene transmission among bacteria due to the ability to integrate their genomes into a host chromosome, therefore, affect the fitness and phenotype of host bacteria. Many virulence genes of pathogenic bacteria were identified in temperate phage genomes, supporting the concept that temperate phages play important roles in increasing the bacterial pathogenicity through delivery of the virulence genes. However, little is known about the roles of temperate phages in attenuation of bacterial virulence. Here, we report a novel Bordetella bronchiseptica temperate phage, vB_BbrS_PHB09 (PHB09), which has a 42,129-bp dsDNA genome with a G+C content of 62.8%. Phylogenetic analysis based on large terminase subunit indicated that phage PHB09 represented a new member of the family Siphoviridae. The genome of PHB09 contains genes encoding lysogen-associated proteins, including integrase and cI protein. The integration site of PHB09 is specifically located within a pilin gene of B. bronchiseptica. Importantly, we found that the integration of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in mice, most likely through disruption the expression of pilin gene. Moreover, a single shot of the prophage bearing B. bronchiseptica strain completely protected mice against lethal challenge with wild-type virulent B. bronchiseptica, indicating the vaccine potential of lysogenized strain. Our findings not only indicate the complicated roles of temperate phages in bacterial virulence other than simple delivery of virulent genes but also provide a potential strategy for developing bacterial vaccines.",

Upon infection, the virulent phages take over the machinery of the host cell to produce and finally lyse the host cell to release their progenies. In addition to the lytic cycle, temperate phages also have a lysogenic cycle, in which phages incorporate their genomes into a host chromosome (or maintain their genome extrachromosomally) and replicate with it without lysing their host cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHoward-Varona_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rHoward-Varona_et+al_2017_a\">Howard-Varona et al, 2017</a>).

The initial characterization of morphology by transmission electron microscopy showed that phage PHB09 had an isometric polyhedral head and a long flexible tail (Data not shown). Based on the morphology and genome sequence, the phage PHB09 was assigned to the family Siphoviridae, according to the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses classification system. The phage PHB09 genome was sequenced, and the large terminase subunit (ORF31) was used to generate phylogenetic trees, which also indicated that PHB09 is a new member of the family Siphoviridae (Figure 1). The phage PHB09 has a dsDNA genome consisting of 42,129-bp with a G+C content of 62.8% (Accession No MN103401). The genome encodes one tRNA (Met-CAT) and 59 putative ORFs, of which 25 proteins have assigned functions and 34 are unique as no homologous proteins were identified (Figure 2A and Table S1). The entire genome contains four functional modules, structure/assembly module, replication module, transcription regulators, and lysis/lysogeny module. Genes in the structure and assembly module include small and large terminase subunit, portal protein, major capsid, and tail proteins (Figure 2A). The replication module contains homologs to known proteins, such as HNH homing endonuclease and methyltransferase. An integrase gene int, which shows 40% identity to the integrase of Pseudomonas phage phiAH14a, was found in the lysogeny module (Figure 2A and Table S1). In addition, the lysogeny related gene, cI, was also identified. No antibiotic resistance genes were found in phage the PHB09 genome when analyzed with ResFinder, a web-service used to examine the phage genome for antibiotic resistance genes (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKleinheinz_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rKleinheinz_et+al_2014_a\">Kleinheinz et al, 2014</a>).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PHB09 integration on its host. Interestingly, we found that the specific integration of PHB09 significant decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in mice. Furthermore, mice intranasally inoculated with 1.8 \u00d7 108 colony-forming unit (CFU) lysogenic strain were completely protected when challenged with 3.0 \u00d7 108 CFU B. bronchiseptica Bb01, indicating the vaccine potential of the lysogenic strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report that the integration of temperate phage reduces the virulence of host bacteria in the mammal, indicating the complicated roles of temperate phages in bacterial virulence other than the simple delivery of virulent genes. Our study also provides a new strategy to design avirulent strains for developing bacterial vaccines."

            "After screening the sewage samples described in the materials and methods, a phage vB_BbrS_PHB09 (PHB09) was isolated using B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01 as a host. The initial characterization of morphology by transmission electron microscopy showed that phage PHB09 had an isometric polyhedral head and a long flexible tail (Data not shown). Based on the morphology and genome sequence, the phage PHB09 was assigned to the family Siphoviridae, according to the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses classification system. The phage PHB09 genome was sequenced, and the large terminase subunit (ORF31) was used to generate phylogenetic trees, which also indicated that PHB09 is a new member of the family Siphoviridae (Figure 1). The phage PHB09 has a dsDNA genome consisting of 42,129-bp with a G+C content of 62.8% (Accession No MN103401). The genome encodes one tRNA (Met-CAT) and 59 putative ORFs, of which 25 proteins have assigned functions and 34 are unique as no homologous proteins were identified (Figure 2A and Table S1). The entire genome contains four functional modules, structure/assembly module, replication module, transcription regulators, and lysis/lysogeny module. Genes in the structure and assembly module include small and large terminase subunit, portal protein, major capsid, and tail proteins (Figure 2A). The replication module contains homologs to known proteins, such as HNH homing endonuclease and methyltransferase. An integrase gene int, which shows 40% identity to the integrase of Pseudomonas phage phiAH14a, was found in the lysogeny module (Figure 2A and Table S1). In addition, the lysogeny related gene, cI, was also identified. No antibiotic resistance genes were found in phage the PHB09 genome when analyzed with ResFinder, a web-service used to examine the phage genome for antibiotic resistance genes (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKleinheinz_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rKleinheinz_et+al_2014_a\">Kleinheinz et al, 2014</a>).

            "To determine the host range of phage PHB09, 119 strains of B. bronchiseptica isolated between 2016 and 2018 were tested using a double-layer agar method. Phage PHB09 was able to infect 89 strains (Table 1). The propagation efficiency of PHB09 in strains was different, with >106 PFU/ml of progeny phages were obtained within 80 strains. Thirty strains were insensitive to PHB09 infection, of which 13 strains were found containing a PHB09 prophage as described below. Phage PHB09 cannot infect other bacteria such as P. multocida (capsular type A and type D) and E. coli DH5\u03b1 (data not shown).",
            "During analyzing the host range of phage PHB09, we identified 30 strains of B. bronchiseptica that were insensitive to phage infection. Since PHB09 is a temperate phage based on genome data (Figure 2A and Table S1), it is possible that these B. bronchiseptica strains might contain prophage PHB09, making them resistant against phage PHB09 infection. We, therefore, designed three sets of phage-specific primers (Table S3, Primers 1F/1R, 2F/2R, and 3F/3R) to screen the phage-insensitive strains for the presence of prophage PHB09 using PCR. We found that 13 of 30 strains contain prophage PHB09. This was further confirmed by second-generation sequencing of 3 randomly selected B. bronchiseptica strains. Interestingly, we found all the three sequenced genomes had a unique integration site of phage PHB09, which is a 14-bp sequence (TGACCGAGTACATC) (Figures 2B,C). To know whether the integration site of prophage PHB09 is unique in B. bronchiseptica genome, two sets of primers, 4F/4R and 5F/5R, were synthesized and used to screen all 13 lysogenized strains (Figures 2C,D and Table S3). If the lysogenized strains contain the same integration site, the primer sets will yield amplicons of 1,030 and 1,314-bp, respectively. Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of PCR products showed that expected amplicons were amplified from all strains, indicating the integration site of prophage PHB09 is unique (Figures 2C,D). To exclude the possibility that phage PHB09 containing more than one integration site, we isolated the genome of all 13 strains and sequenced them with the primers, 5F and 4R, which match the ends of",

Similar results were observed when B. bronchiseptica strains were incubated with serum for 2 h (Figure 3C, P < 0.001). Incubation with inactive serum or PBS did not decrease the titers of B. bronchiseptica strains, Bb01 and Bb01+ (Figures 3B,C).

Interestingly, as shown in Figure 3D, we found that the titer of Bb01+ was significantly lower than that of its parental strain, Bb01 (P < 0.01). Similarly, the titers of invaded B. bronchiseptica strains Bb01 and Bb01+ were determined individually after 4 h incubation with HEp-2 cells. We observed similar results that the titer of strain Bb01 was significantly higher than that of the strain Bb01+ (P < 0.01) (Figure 3E). We then employed RAW264.7 cells, a commonly used macrophage cell line, to evaluate the anti-phagocytic ability of strains Bb01 and Bb01+. Interestingly, we found that the titer of Bb01+ was significantly lower than that of Bb01 after 2 h incubation with RAW264.7 cells at 37\u25e6C (P < 0.05) (Figure 3F), indicating the integration of phage PHB09 decreased the anti-phagocytic ability of B. bronchiseptica.",

The tracheal mucosa was severely damaged and even disappeared, neutrophils infiltrated in the lamina propria, and the tracheal glands in the submucosa dilated (Figure 4B, up panel). The inherent structure of the lungs was damaged (Figure 4B, low panel), and multiple necrotic foci with bronchus as the center were observed. The bronchus in the necrotic foci was filled with exfoliated mucosal epithelial cells and inflammatory cells. The surrounding alveolar cavity was filled with necrotic tissue cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and blue-stained bacterial colonies. Most of the alveolar walls of the necrotic foci were hyperemia thickened, and the alveolar cavity was filled with serous exudate (Figure 4B, low panel). Interestingly, infection of B. bronchiseptica Bb01+ caused only minor pathological changes both in tracheae and lungs (Figure 4C). The tracheal mucosa was relatively intact, which was similar as observed in PBS group (Figures 4C,D, up panel). The inherent structure of the lungs was intact, and the alveolar walls were slightly thicker with capillary congestion and neutrophil infiltration compared to the PBS control group (Figures 4C,D, low panel). Taken together, these data indicated that the specific integration of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of B. bronchiseptica Bb01.",
            "The Phage Lysogenized Strain Is a Promising Vaccine Candidate Against B. bronchiseptica",
            "Due to the inherent ability to stimulate an excellent immune response, live attenuated vaccines are believed as the most effective vaccines. To test the potentiality of the avirulent B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01+ as a live attenuated vaccine, mice were immunized with strain Bb01+ and challenged virulent B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01 as shown in Figure 5A. The strain Bb01+ immunized group showed 100% protection against challenge with 3.0 \u00d7 108 CFU B. bronchiseptica Bb01(Figure 5B). All mice in the control group, which was inoculated with PBS before challenge, died within 3 days post-challenge (Figure 5). The survival mice were sacrificed on 22-day post immunization (DPI) for histopathological analysis of lung and trachea. No significant histopathological changes were observed in both lung and trachea (data not shown). These results indicated that the prophage PHB09 bearing B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01+ could be a promising attenuated vaccine candidate."

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "It was demonstrated that phages are one of the driving forces of bacterial evolution and vice versa (Koskella and Brockhurst, FIGURE 4 | The virulence of B. bronchiseptica strains Bb01 and Bb01+ in vivo. (A) Mouse infection assay. Three groups of BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with Bb01, Bb01+, and PBS respectively and monitored daily for mortality. On day 3, three mice of each group were randomly selected and sacrificed for histopathologic analysis of tracheae (up panel) and lungs (low panel) of mice infected with Bb01 (B), Bb01+ (C), and PBS (D). See results for the details. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test.",
            "2014; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTao_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rTao_et+al_2018_a\">Tao et al, 2018</a>). The infection of lytic phages will finally lead to the burst of host cells to release progeny phages. Undoubtedly, bacteria can evolve resistance to phage infections through de novo mutation for survival, which might lead to the changes in bacterial traits (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBuckling_2002_a\" href=\"#rBuckling_2002_a\">Buckling and Rainey, 2002</a>). Due to the ability of horizontal gene transfer, temperate phages also affect the fitness and phenotype of their host bacteria (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cArgov_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rArgov_et+al_2017_a\">Argov et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHoward-Varona_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rHoward-Varona_et+al_2017_a\">Howard-Varona et al, 2017</a>). One attractive phenotype of pathogenic bacteria is the virulence, which determines the pathogenicity of the infectious disease. Particularly, the temperate phages can increase the virulence of the host bacteria by transmitting virulence genes, many of which were identified in phage genomes (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBoyd_2012_a\" href=\"#rBoyd_2012_a\">Boyd, 2012</a>).",
            "The enhancement of bacterial virulence caused by temperate phage was frequently reported (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDavies_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rDavies_et+al_2016_a\">Davies et al, 2016</a>). However, temperate phage-mediated attenuation of virulence was rarely found. In this study, we reported a temperate phage PHB09 isolated from sewage water, and found that lysogeny of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 both in vitro (Figure 3) and in vivo (Figure 4). Sequence and morphological analysis indicated that it is a new phage and can be classified to Siphoviridae family. The genome of PHB09 encodes one tRNA gene and 59 putative ORFs (Figure 2A and Table S1), and no antibiotic resistance genes were identified (Table S2). Lysogeny related genes including integrase, which shows 40% identity to the integrase of Pseudomonas phage phiAH14a, and cI gene were identified.",
            "The temperate phages integrate their genome into the host chromosome through either site-specific recombination (such as \u03bb phage) or random transposition (such as Mu phage) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCampbell_2003_a\" href=\"#rCampbell_2003_a\">Campbell, 2003</a>). We found the integration site of phage PHB09 in B. bronchiseptica genome is specific (Figures 2B,C) and locates in a gene coding a pilin protein, which showed the highest homology with Oligella urethralis pilin protein (Figure S1). Integration of phage PHB09 disrupts gene for the expression of pilin protein, which might lead to attenuation of B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01+. Pilin proteins form hair-like pili, which are found on the surfaces of bacteria, usually, are responsible for the adhesion to the host cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSoto_1999_a\" href=\"#rSoto_1999_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSoto_1999_a\" href=\"#rSoto_1999_a\">Soto and Hultgren, 1999</a></a>; WintherLarsen et al, 2001). Many studies have identified pilin proteins as virulent factors of pathogenic bacteria, such as E. coli (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSoto_1999_a\" href=\"#rSoto_1999_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSoto_1999_a\" href=\"#rSoto_1999_a\">Soto and Hultgren, 1999</a></a>) and Vibrio cholera (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cUtada_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rUtada_et+al_2014_a\">Utada et al, 2014</a>). Recently studies reported that pili of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to sense the extracellular signals, leading to the expression of hundreds of genes associated with pathogenicity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPersat_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rPersat_et+al_2015_a\">Persat et al, 2015</a>). Therefore, it is possible that phage PHB09 mediated attenuation of B. bronchiseptica through disruption of the pilin gene. We tried to knock out the pili gene of B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01, but failed because it is very hard to edit B. bronchiseptica genome. Further studies are needed to confirm this possibility once the genome editing methods are available.",
            "Furthermore, our results showed that immunization with the avirulent strain Bb01+ completely protected mice against lethal challenge with virulent B. bronchiseptica, indicating the vaccine potential of Bb01+. Most of the live attenuated vaccines were developed by mutating or deleting the virulence-associated gene(s) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMinor_2015_a\" href=\"#rMinor_2015_a\">Minor, 2015</a>). Integration of a temperate phage disrupts gene for the expression of bacterial virulent gene, which will lead to the attenuation of the pathogen, and could be a new strategy to develop bacterial vaccines. However, it is well-known that prophages can switch to the lytic life cycle, in which the prophage DNA is excised from the host genome. Although such process often accompanied by lysis of the host cells, curing of prophages from host bacteria was reported in some bacteria (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cEuler_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rEuler_et+al_2016_a\">Euler et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAucouturier_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rAucouturier_et+al_2018_a\">Aucouturier et al, 2018</a>). Therefore, it is necessary to ensure there is no spontaneous release of prophage before using a lysogenized bacterium as a live attenuated vaccine. In case of prophage PHB09, we found that the induction of phage PHB09 always led to the lysis of B. bronchiseptica Bb01+. Therefore, there is little chance for B. bronchiseptica Bb01+ to reverse to the virulent state by release of prophage PHB09. Additionally, rather than a live attenuated vaccine, B. bronchiseptica Bb01+ can be used as an avirulent seed strain to develop inactivated vaccines.",
            "Taken together, we report a temperate phage PHB09, which significantly decreases the virulence of B. bronchiseptica, most likely, due to the disruption of the pilin gene through specific integration. Our studies indicate the complicated roles of temperate phages in bacterial virulence other than the simple delivery of virulent genes. Our study also provides a new strategy to design bacterial vaccines."
