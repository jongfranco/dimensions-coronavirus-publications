        "abstract": "In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible\u2014or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.",

            "In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible\u2014or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.

            "Further genetic and amino acid sequencing of the S-protein of 2019-nCoV established that the receptorbinding domain of the S-protein binds to recipient cells and interacts strongly with human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor molecules.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] This finding shows that the underlying pathogenesis of the virus is to infect the human respiratory epithelium through the S-protein-ACE2 binding pathway.

            "By 29 January 2020, the virus had infected more than 7000 people in China and had caused 170 deaths.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] At the same time, the disease is gradually being spread to several other countries as the virus can be transmitted through air and contact.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Fortunately, at least 124 patients have been cured, according to a recent report of the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]",
            "According to the research that examined the infectious patients in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] typical clinical features included fever (98%, 40 of 41), cough (76%, 31 of 41), malaise (44%, 18 of 41), sputum production (28%, 11 of 39), and other less-common symptoms (headache, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, etc.). The median age of the infected patients was 47 years (interquartile range [IQR], 41.0\u201358.0), and the median time from onset to admission was 7 days (IQR, 4.0\u20138.0). Severely ill patients may have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, secondary infection, septic shock, and acute kidney injury. Laboratory findings include lymphopenia, leucopenia, elevated concentrations of procalcitonin, serum amyloid A, D-dimer, and hypersensitive troponin and longer prothrombin times.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]",
            "The 2019-nCoV epidemic is suspected to be highly similar to other highly threatening coronavirus diseases such as SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), both intensely infectious diseases related to animals.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Like with other epidemics, health systems need to respond quickly and accurately to control the spread of the virus. Here, we describe our understanding of the 2019-nCoV epidemic and our experience with other coronavirus-related diseases in West China Hospital. Based on this, we aim to establish a precision medicine approach to managing Wuhan coronavirus pneumonia, starting from accurate and rapid recognition of individuals infected by 2019-nCoV. It will facilitate decision-making by health care workers with necessary clinical information, laboratory detection, and imaging findings. The approach consists of the following four parts: screening, diagnosis, preventive control, and treatment of 2019-CoV pneumonia (Fig. 1). Given our clinical experience in preventing and treating various viral pneumonia, including those caused by coronaviruses, we believe that such an approach would help in preventing further the spreading of 2019-nCoV.",
            "In West China Hospital of Sichuan University at Chengdu, one of the top hospitals in China, we found that infections caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have a seasonal pattern that varies among age groups (Fig. 2). Winter and spring are associated with the highest incidence of coronavirus epidemics, which is consistent with the current epidemic of 2019-nCoV. In this sense, the particularities of 2019-nCoV incidence should not be overemphasized.",
            "To date, seven strains of coronaviruses have been confirmed to infect humans: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARSCoV, HCoV-NL63, Human coronavirus HKU1, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Since HCoV-229 and HCoV-OC43 were identified in 1966 and 1967, respectively,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] the coronaviruses have been known to cause mild-to-severe respiratory disease. In the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2002 and 2003, more than 8000 people were infected and 916 died.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Subsequently, by 28 February 2018, 2066 confirmed cases were attributed to MERS-CoV while more than 720 deaths were reported.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]",
            "Patients with SARS or MERS infections present with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from upper respiratory tract infection to ARDS, whereas other HCoVs cause severe lower respiratory tract infection, primarily in the elderly and neonates.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]",
            "Currently, the most common diagnostic method of coronaviruses is molecular detection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] A precision medicine approach is crucial to quickly confirm the diagnosis with laboratory methods, control the spread of the virus, and better allocate hospital resources.",

            "(a) A history of fever or a high temperature; (b) A dry cough or sore throat; (c) Malaise; (d) Shortness of breath.",
            "Patients who meet any of these epidemiological criteria and who present with some of the above clinical manifestations should be quickly referred to designated hospitals for further examination.",
            "The diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection in the precision medicine approach involves both nucleic acid detection and chest computed tomography (CT) scan.",
            "The National Health Commission issued a guidance on 27 January 2020, to remind medical institutions of the importance of chest CT and pathogen detection in diagnosing the virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Thin-slice highresolution CT algorithms are strongly recommended for the scanning and reconstruction of CT images. The imaging findings from chest CT scans of 2019nCoV patients are characteristics of viral pneumonia, including multiple patch shadows and interstitial changes with significant peripheral distribution (Fig. 3). At early stage they are mainly ground-glass opacities with air bronchogram sign, but may progress to become dense consolidation shadows in the later stage, or in severe cases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Though suggestive to 2019-nCoV infection, these radiological features alone are not enough for diagnosis of 2019-nCoV pneumonia, since they are oftentimes very similar to those of other viral pneumonia.",
            "The WHO guidance recommends testing the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV with RT-PCR.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Currently, the targeting regions of RT-PCR testing kits consist of open reading frames 1a or 1b (ORF1ab) and the envelope gene (E gene) or the nucleocapsid protein gene (N gene).",

            "(ii) The diagnosis is \u2018Highly Suspected\u2019 in patients with an RTPCR result positive for ORF1ab and negative for N gene/E gene. The analyses should be repeated with a different RTPCR kit or replicated with a nucleic acid test kit based on a different methodology (Fig. 4b) or further genomic sequencing should determine whether the virus has a potential mutation.",
            "(iii) The diagnosis is \u2018Uncertain\u2019 when ORF1ab gene amplification is negative. In this case, regardless of the N gene/E gene result, a replicate test should be done with another kit, or the process of sampling and testing should be repeated (Fig. 4c).",
            "(iv) The interpretations of 2019-nCoV RT-PCR results (Fig. 4d): a positive nucleic acid test result includes a cycle threshold (Ct) value less than 35 and a standard S-shaped amplification curve of ORF1ab, N gene/E gene, and internal control (IC) on RT-PCR. A negative RT-PCR result is one with absence of amplification curve for ORF1ab and N gene/E gene and, at the same time, presence of an S-shaped amplification curve for IC (Fig. 4e). When the Ct value is between 35 and 40, the result is a suspected positive and should be reviewed before a diagnosis is done.",
            "Quality control of specimen collection is vital to the diagnostic procedure. Collection of appropriate specimens from suspected cases and their close contacts as early as possible is a cornerstone of RT-PCR testing. The WHO recommends sampling from the lower respiratory tract[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] that should meet the following standards:",
            "(i) Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid should be collected using a fiber bronchoscope by clinicians or respiratory therapists. After 100\u2013300 mL of sterilized saline being injected into the bronchia, the liquid is collected by negative pressure (\u223c100 mm Hg) with sterile containers. The total volume",

Patients with a low sputum volume should be provided with aerosol inhalation using a 0.9% NaCl solution at 25\u25e6C (Fig. 5b). (iii) Laboratory experts should collect secretions from the palatine arch, pharynx, and tonsils with flocked swabs. Two or three swabs are required for accurate detection (Fig. 5c and d)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "On 18 January 2020, after the admission of the suspected cases in West China Hospital, a multidisciplinary team was organized for patients with fevers of unknown cause.
