        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19) calls for and welcomes possible treatment strategies using drugs on the market. It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D-structures of key virous proteins are resolved. Taking the advantage of a recently released crystal structure of COVID-19 protease in complex with a covalently-bonded inhibitor, N3,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials. For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an endpoint method called MM-PBSA-WSAS.&lt;sup&gt;2-4&lt;/sup&gt; Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 protease, including Carfilzomib, Eravacycline, Valrubicin, Lopinavir and Elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anti-cancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, -13.82 kcal/mol. Streptomycin, an antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (-3.82 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (-7.92 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of -12.86 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor-ligand binding were identified. I found that one hotspot residue HIS41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including COVID-19, SARS, MERS, and HCV. The findings of this study can facilitate rational drug design targeting the COVID-19 protease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n&lt;/p&gt;",

            "A great application of drug repurposing is to identify drugs which were developed for treating other diseases to treat a new disease. Drug repurposing can be achieved by conducting systematic drug-drug target interaction (DTI) and drug-drug interaction (DDI) analyses. We have conducted a survey on DTIs collected by the DrugBank database[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and found that on average each drug has 3 drug targets and each drug target has 4.7 drugs.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] The analysis demonstrates that polypharmacology is a common phenomenon. It is important to identify potential DTIs for both approved drugs and drug candidates, which serves as the basis of repurposing drugs and selection of drug targets without DTIs that may cause side-effects. Polypharmacology opens novel avenues to rationally design next generation of more effective but less toxic therapeutic agents. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has been playing essential roles in modern drug discovery and development. To balance the computational efficiency and accuracy, a hieratical strategy employing different types of scoring functions are applied in both the drug lead identification and optimization phases. A docking scoring function, such as the one employed by the Glide docking program,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] is very efficient and thus can be utilized to screen a large library, but it is not very accurate. On the other hand, the molecular mechanical force field (MMFF)-based scoring functions, are physical and more accurate, but much less efficient. With the ever increasing computer power, MMFF-based free energy calculation methods, such as the endpoint MM-PB/GBSA (molecular mechanicsPoisson Boltzmann/ Generalized Born Surface Area) methods[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] and the alchemical thermodynamic integration (TI) and free energy perturbation (FEP) methods,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] have been extensively applied in structure-based drug discovery projects.

In this work, I applied multiscale modeling techniques to identify drugs that may be repurposed to target COVID-19 protease Flexible docking and MM-PBSA-WSAS were applied as the 1st and 2nd filters, respectively, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of HVS to identify inhibitors of COVID-19. Compared to the experimental means, CADD-based approaches are more efficient in providing possible treatment solutions for epidemic disease outbreaks like COVID-19.

            "The outbreak of highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19 demands to work out multiple treatment plans as soon as possible. Computational drug repurposing study can provide treatment options in a short period of time. For this study, amounts of computational time used for individual tasks are as follows. Docking screenings of all the 2201 approved drugs with a single CPU core (Intel Xeon CPU E5-2683) took 11 hours. For each docking hit, we need to perform ab initio calculations to derive point charges. The ab initio calculations using wB97XD/6-31G*//HF/631G* consumed about 1 day using four CPU cores; then it took us about 1.2 days to sample 120 nanoseconds using one GTX-1080 ti GPU; the following MM-PBSA-WSAS calculation consumed one day. Therefore, equipped with sufficient numbers of CPUs and GPUs and the current hardware, we can finish the drug repurposing screenings within four to five days using a reliable HVS strategy. Given that the inhibitors of COVID-19 protease have relatively large sizes, the screening time can be even shorter for other drug targets with smaller ligands."

        "conclusion": [
            "In this study, I took advantage of the recently released crystal structure of COVID-19 protease and conducted multiscale drug repurposing screenings. Five neutral drugs, namely, Carfilzomib, Eravacycline, Valrubicin, Lopinavir and Elbasvir, are identified to have inhibitory activities against COVID-19 protease. Streptomycin, a charged molecule may also be an inhibitor of this COVID-19 protease. Our study suggests that computational drug repurposing screening is very efficient and it can provide potential repurposing drug candidates in less than five days. A set of hotspot residues which make substantial contributions to the protein-ligand binding are also identified, which can facilitate us to rationally design novel selective inhibitors targeting COVID19.<br/><br/>ASSOCIATED CONTENT"

            "The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19) calls for and welcomes possible treatment strategies using drugs on the market. It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D-structures of key virous proteins are resolved. Taking the advantage of a recently released crystal structure of COVID-19 protease in complex with a covalently-bonded inhibitor, N3,1 I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials. For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an endpoint method called MM-PBSA-WSAS.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 protease, including Carfilzomib, Eravacycline, Valrubicin, Lopinavir and Elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anti-cancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, -13.82 kcal/mol. Streptomycin, an antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (-3.82 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (-7.92 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of -12.86 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor-ligand binding were identified. I found that one hotspot residue HIS41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including COVID-19, SARS, MERS, and HCV. The findings of this study can facilitate rational drug design targeting the COVID-19 protease."

            "2. Methodologies. I conducted a hierarchical virtual screening (HVS) using the newly resolved crystal structure of COVID-19 protease (Resolution 2.16\u00c5).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Two types of HVS filters were employed: Glide[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] flexible docking followed by MM-PBSA-WSAS.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Detailed computational methods are described below.",
            "2.1 Docking Screening The crystal structure was first treated using the protein structure preparation wizard provided by the Schrodinger software, followed by docking grid generation. Glide flexible docking was performed using the default settings except that the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds was rewarded and the enhancement of planarity of conjugated pi groups was turned on. The cocrystal ligand, N3, was covalently bonded to CYS145. I generated a new version of N3, N3\u2019 by breaking the covalent bond and filling in open valence. I then evaluated whether Glide flexible docking can reproduce the native binding pose. In addition, dataset of approved drugs was prepared using DrugBank,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and a set of PubChem compounds which are structurally similar to Lopinavir were enriched for docking screenings. Lopinavir, a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] was found effective in treating COVID-19 patients. Top hits from the docking screenings were advanced to the next HVS filter \u2013 MM-PBSA-WSAS.",
            "2.2 System setup for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and free energy calculation MD simulations were first performed for a docking hit for two purposes: (1) studying the relative stability of the ligand residing in the binding pocket; (2) sampling a set of conformations for MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy calculations and MM-GBSA residue-ligand binding free energy decomposition analysis. A MD system consisted of one copy of COVID-19 protease, one copy of docked ligand, 17597 TIP3P26 water molecules, about 50 Na+ and Cl- ions depending on the charge state of the ligand. The whole system was neutralized. For the force field parameters, the partial atomic charges of ligands were derived using the RESP27 program to fit the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potentials generated using the GAUSSIAN 16 software package[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. The other force field parameters were derived from GAFF29 and the AMBER FF14SB30 force field to model proteins. The residue topologies for ligands were prepared using the Antechamber module.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] For the covalently-bonded N3 ligand, I applied the residuegen program to generate non-standard amino acid residue topology.",
            "2.3 MD Simulation Protocols. For a protein-ligand complex, the MD system was first relaxed through a series of minimization procedures. The mainchain atoms of the receptor and the bound ligand were restrained using a harmonic potential and its force constant decreased from 20 to 10, 5, 1 and 0 kcal/mol/\u00c52, progressively in five 10,000-step minimizations. Note that the last step applied no restraint at all as the force constant is 0. The system was further relaxed by a set of 100-picosecond atomistic MD simulations with the same restrain setting of minimizations.",
            "There were three phases for a MD simulation: the relaxation phase, the equilibrium phase, and the sampling phase. In the relaxation phase, the simulation system was heated up progressively from 50 K to 250 K at steps of 50 K. At each temperature, a 1-nanosecond MD simulation was performed without any restraints or constraints. In the next equilibrium phase, the system was equilibrated at 298 K, 1 bar for 20 ns. Finally, a 100-nanosecond MD simulation was performed at 298 K, 1 bar to produce NTP (constant temperature and pressure) ensembles. In total, 10,000 snapshots were recorded from the last simulation. 200 snapshots were evenly selected for the MMPBSA-WSAS binding free energy calculation and 5000 were selected for the MM-GBSA ligandprotein binding free energy decomposition analysis. Additional settings for constant pressure MD simulations performed in this work are listed as follows: temperature was regulated using Langevin dynamics[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] with a collision frequency of 5 ps-1; pressure was regulated using the isotropic position scaling algorithm with the pressure relaxation time set to 1.0 ps; integration of the equations of motion was conducted at a time step of 1 fs for the two relaxation phases and 2 fs for the equilibrium and sampling phases. The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] was used to calculate the full electrostatic energy of a unit cell in a macroscopic lattice of repeating images. All bonds were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] in both the minimization and MD simulation stages.

Besides the electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, the solvation effect was taken into account using a Generalized GB model developed by Onufriev et al.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>] The ligand-residue MM-GBSA interaction energies were calculated using the Sander program in AMBER18.35 Data analysis was performed using an internal program developed by us.

            "I explored the MD stability of each MD system. Figure 4 showed the RMSD fluctuations along the MD simulation time. It is shown that the mainchain atoms of the receptor (black curves) and the secondary structures (red curves) reached equilibrium after 20 nanoseconds. The least-square (LS) fitted RMSDs of the ligands (green curves) are around 2 \u00c5, which is reasonable for large ligands like COVID-19 protease inhibitors. A ligand\u2019s No-Fit RMSD was calculated by first performing LS-fitting for the main chain atoms of the receptor and the resulting translation-rotation matrix was applied to the ligand, and then the RMSD was calculated directly. Evidently, the ligand No-Fit RMSDs measures not only the conformational changes, but also its translational and rotational movements inside the binding pocket. The ligand No-Fit RMSDs (blue curves) are larger than the LS-Fit values, however, those values around 3-4 \u00c5 are still acceptable for large ligands. In summary, the RMSD fluctuation analysis suggests that the MD trajectories are overall stable during the sampling phase for all the studied MD systems.",
            "I first generated the average structure of the collected snapshots, and then the MD snapshot that had the smallest main chain atom RMSD against the average structure was chosen as the representative conformation. The comparisons between the crystal structure and the representative MD conformations are shown in Figure 5 for the native ligand N3, and Figures 6-8 for the other ligands. As shown in Figure 5, the benzene motif located in the dashed red cycle was inserted between two hotspot residues (HIS41 and MET49) for the MD structure, which is quite distinct from the crystal structure, which shows that the benzene motif has no direct interactions with HIS4 and MET49. I believe that under physiological conditions, the benzene motif becomes less solvent exposed and has more favorable interactions with HIS4 and MET49 by inserting itself between the side chains of the two residues. As shown below, both HIS4 and MET49 were hotspot residues in our MM-GBSA free energy decomposition analysis.",
            "3.3 MM-PBSA-WSAS Binding Free Energy Calculations I measured the ligand binding affinity using the endpoint MM-PBSA method. Considering the ligands of COVID-19 protease are flexible molecules with large sizes, the contribution from conformational entropy cannot be neglected. Instead of applying normal mode analysis to estimate the entropic effect, I applied an efficient method called WSAS4 to calculate this energy term. This scoring function is therefore called MM-PBSA-WSAS. The calculated binding free energies and the Glide docking scores are summarized in Table 1. The calculated entropic term, T S, is quite different for different ligands as shown in Table 1, suggesting the necessity of including this term in binding free energy calculations. The structures of the promising drug repurposing candidates, which have both excellent docking scores and MM-PBSA-WSAS binding affinities are shown in Figures 1-3. All the known drugs shown in Figure 1 are neutral and have a better MM-PBSAWSAS affinity than -5.0 kcal/mol. It should be noted that the cocrystal ligand, N3 is covalently bonded to the receptor, therefore its binding free energy is not directly comparable to those noncovalent ligands. The individual terms of MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energies of other less potent ligands were summarized in Table S1.",
            "The values of each energy term, van der Waals ( EVDW), electrostatics ( EVDW +  GPB), nonpolar solvation term ( GSA), and entropy (T S), vary significantly from one system to another (Table 1 and Table S1), suggesting there is no single energy term that dominates the protein-ligand interaction.",
            "For the charged drug molecules, caution should be taken in result interpretation. For example, the neural form of Streptomycin (DB01082) has a MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy of -7.92 kcal/mol, much better than the charged form (-3.82 kcal/mol). However, the latter is dominant under physiological conditions. We therefore should use the result of the charged form or take the penalty of protonation into consideration when using the result of the neutral form.",

        "4. Discussion": [
            "The outbreak of highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19 demands to work out multiple treatment plans as soon as possible. Computational drug repurposing study can provide treatment options in a short period of time. For this study, amounts of computational time used for individual tasks are as follows. Docking screenings of all the 2201 approved drugs with a single CPU core (Intel Xeon CPU E5-2683) took 11 hours. For each docking hit, we need to perform ab initio calculations to derive point charges. The ab initio calculations using wB97XD/6-31G*//HF/631G* consumed about 1 day using four CPU cores; then it took us about 1.2 days to sample 120 nanoseconds using one GTX-1080 ti GPU; the following MM-PBSA-WSAS calculation consumed one day. Therefore, equipped with sufficient numbers of CPUs and GPUs and the current hardware, we can finish the drug repurposing screenings within four to five days using a reliable HVS strategy. Given that the inhibitors of COVID-19 protease have relatively large sizes, the screening time can be even shorter for other drug targets with smaller ligands.",
            "Another consideration is the availability of high-quality drug target structures. Luckily, a highresolution crystal structure of COVID-19 protease in complex with a ligand was resolved timely, allowing us to conduct this drug repurpose screening. If no high-quality structure is available, one can rely on homology modeling technique, probably with a reduced success rate of identifying repurposing drugs. Take COVID-19 protease as an example, I performed structural alignments using an internal program which takes a multiple-sequence-alignment (MSA) as an input. The MSA was generated by using the Promals3D web server.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>] The structure of COVID-19 protease is found to be most similar to those of SARS protease (PDB Code 3TNT42) and less similar to MERS protease (PDB Code 5WKK43) (Figure 9A). In comparison, the structure of HCV NS3/4A (PDB Code 3M5L44) is quite different: the RMSD of 2.26 \u00c5 between HCV and COVID-19 is much larger and with only 108 residues participating the least-square fitting (Figure 9B). I also compared the sequences of the four proteases around the seven hotspot residues, which are colored in red in Table 3. It is shown that COVID-19 and SARS share all the seven hotspot residues. MERS and COVID-19 have four of the seven common hotspot residues, while HCV NS3/4A and COVID19 have only one common hotspot residue (H41). Even though the sequence identity is low between COVID-19 and HCV NS3/4A, as shown in Figure 9B, the co-crystal ligands, N3 (green sticks) for COVID-19 and ITMN-191 (brown sticks) for HCV NS3/4A, largely overlap. This suggests that homology models can be constructed using Modeller[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>] with SARS, MERS and even HCV NS3/4A as templates.",

        "5. Conclusion": [
            "In this study, I took advantage of the recently released crystal structure of COVID-19 protease and conducted multiscale drug repurposing screenings. Five neutral drugs, namely, Carfilzomib, Eravacycline, Valrubicin, Lopinavir and Elbasvir, are identified to have inhibitory activities against COVID-19 protease. Streptomycin, a charged molecule may also be an inhibitor of this COVID-19 protease. Our study suggests that computational drug repurposing screening is very efficient and it can provide potential repurposing drug candidates in less than five days. A set of hotspot residues which make substantial contributions to the protein-ligand binding are also identified, which can facilitate us to rationally design novel selective inhibitors targeting COVID19.",
