The estimates continue to be updated, and on Feb 4, 2020, the number of confirmed cases reached re 20,630 globally in 24 countries, most of which occurring in China (20,471 cases)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The clinical severity ranges from asymptomatic individuals to death. So far, 425 deaths have been reported in China and 1 death in the Philippines[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].
