        "abstract": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes severe economic losses through severe morbidity and mortality and poses a significant threat to the global poultry industry. Significant efforts have been made to develop novel vaccines and therapeutics; however, the interaction of NDV with the host is not yet fully understood. Interferons (IFNs), an integral component of innate immune signaling, act as the first line of defense against invading viruses. Compared with the mammalian repertoire of IFNs, limited information is available on the antiviral potential of IFNs in chickens. Here, we expressed chicken IFN-\u03b3 (chIFN-\u03b3) using a baculovirus expression vector system, characterized its antiviral potential against NDV, and determined its antiviral potential. Priming of chicken embryo fibroblasts with chIFN-\u03b3 elicited an antiviral environment in primary cells, which was mainly due to interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). A genome-wide transcriptomics approach was used to elucidate the possible signaling pathways associated with IFN-\u03b3-induced immune responses. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed significant induction of ISG-associated pathways, activated temporal expression of ISGs, antiviral mediators, and transcriptional regulators in a cascade of antiviral responses. Collectively, we found that IFN-\u03b3 significantly elicited an antiviral response against NDV infection. These data provide a foundation for chIFN-\u03b3-mediated antiviral responses and underpin functional annotation of these important chIFN-\u03b3-induced antiviral influencers.",

            "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes severe economic losses through severe morbidity and mortality and poses a significant threat to the global poultry industry. Significant efforts have been made to develop novel vaccines and therapeutics; however, the interaction of NDV with the host is not yet fully understood. Interferons (IFNs), an integral component of innate immune signaling, act as the first line of defense against invading viruses. Compared with the mammalian repertoire of IFNs, limited information is available on the antiviral potential of IFNs in chickens. Here, we expressed chicken IFN-\u03b3 (chIFN-\u03b3) using a baculovirus expression vector system, characterized its antiviral potential against NDV, and determined its antiviral potential. Priming of chicken embryo fibroblasts with chIFN-\u03b3 elicited an antiviral environment in primary cells, which was mainly due to interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). A genome-wide transcriptomics approach was used to elucidate the possible signaling pathways associated with IFN-\u03b3-induced immune responses. RNAsequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed significant induction of ISG-associated pathways, activated temporal expression of ISGs, antiviral mediators, and transcriptional regulators in a cascade of antiviral responses. Collectively, we found that IFN-\u03b3 significantly elicited an antiviral response against NDV infection. These data provide a foundation for chIFN-\u03b3-mediated antiviral responses and underpin functional annotation of these important chIFN-\u03b3-induced antiviral influencers.",

            "The innate immune response is the primary line of defense against invading pathogens. Upon viral invasion of host cells, the innate immune response is activated in an antigen-independent manner [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Interferons (IFNs) are the pleiotropic group of signaling proteins that are cytokines in nature and also function as natural immune boosters, antitumor factors, and antiviral molecules that play a fundamental role in stimulating an active antiviral environment within the host cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. IFNs are broadly classified into three distinct groups based on their molecular architecture, pathway induction, and cell-receptor specificity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",

In chickens, type I IFNs are secreted by developing cells (i.e. fibroblasts), type II IFNs are synthesized by immune cells, and type III IFNs are secreted in a variety of cells in a tissue-dependent manner [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].

Regardless of the functional diversity, IFNs are involved in a cohesive, integrated, and precisely synchronized immune response cascade.",
            "Similar to its mammalian orthologue, chIFN-\u03b3 is a 16.8-kDa cytokine composed of 169 amino acids (aa), a 19-aa signaling segment, and a 145-aa backbone [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Sensitive to heat (65\u25e6C) and low pH, chIFN-\u03b3 is secreted by immune cells (i.e. NK cells and T lymphocytes) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] and is considered to be the major macrophage activator in Aves [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Previous studies have revealed that chIFN\u03b3 can halt viral replication, enhance activation of both MHC-I and MHC-II molecules, and assist in antigen presentation and processing as well as removal of intracellular pathogens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Moreover, chIFN-\u03b3 activates T-helper I-type immune responses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. IFN-\u03b3 and its adjuvant characteristics have potential antiviral activity against avian viral pathogens such as avian influenza virus (AIV), NDV, and Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV), respectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Surprisingly, IFN\u03b3 also facilitates the production of nitric oxide that is a significant marker of viral inhibition [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Identification of IFN-\u03b3 in other avian species including pigeon, duck, quail, guinea fowl, goose, pheasant, and turkey illustrates its role as a natural constituent of the innate immune system in Aves [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. Like other chicken cytokines, the chIFN-\u03b3 signaling cascade is not clearly understood; however, it is thought to be similar to mammalian cytokines in that it also utilizes the classical Janus kinases-signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>].",

Moreover, the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-\u03b3 as a vaccine adjuvant has been demonstrated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. However, enhanced protection and a boost in avian immune response were also observed in chickens. Administration of chIFN-\u03b3 along with fowlpox and DNA vaccines resulted in elevated antibody titer, improved cellular responses, and protection against NDV challenge in chickens and turkeys [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Similarly, chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) do not have the key receptors required for type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. Therefore, we explored the potential of IFN-\u03b3 to act against NDV in CEFs, in vitro. There is limited data on the nature and dynamics of immune responses induced by chIFN-\u03b3 that establishes an antiviral state that can then be used to guide the development of more reliable and advanced therapeutics in poultry, with the aim of preventing respiratory viral infection, replication, and shedding. To date, most of the commercially available IFN-\u03b3 preparations are produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli. Standardization of expression conditions and a lack of glycosylation render these IFN-\u03b3 preparations more protease-resistant compared with the glycosylated forms that have a shorter half-life in the blood. Endotoxin contamination, inclusion body formation, and complex protein purification from E. coli increase production costs of E. coli-derived IFN-\u03b3 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>].",

By using the transcriptomic approach, we tried to analyze the variations in gene expression in CEFs during the antiviral experiments. Transcriptomic profiling revealed distinct upregulation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and temporal expression of ISGs and presented significant pathways involved in the cascade of avian immunity."

To study the pattern of ISG expression, CEFs were further stimulated with a serial dilution of IFNs for 12 h. CEFs were then treated with chIFN-\u03b3 at a concentration of 4.19 \u00d7 103 IU/ml.

            "BEVS was used for the construction and expression of chIFN-\u03b3. A Luciferase reporter gene was used to assess the expression efficiency as previously described [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. Co-transfection of the pVL1393-luc plasmid and reBmBac DNA in Bm5 cells are presented in Fig. 1. To investigate the optimal viral strain for luciferase expression, a viral plaque assay was performed. The supernatant from Bm5 cells containing recombinant BmNPV (reBm-luc) was acquired 5 days post-transfection. Additionally, after 100\u2013120 h, all proteins were harvested from silkworm pupae and 50 \u03bcg protein from larval hemolymph was used for luciferase assays. Luminescence observed from hemolymph was (4.33 \u00b1 0.61) \u00d7 108 relative light units (RLUs) in comparison to 150\u2013300 RLUs from the mock controls. Results from western blot analysis further confirmed the successful expression of the chIFN-\u03b3 gene in BEVS (Supplementary Fig. S1).",
            "The antiviral effect of recombinant chIFN-\u03b3 was measured by the VSV-GFP reporter assay. It was found that the BEVS expressed chIFN-\u03b3 was biologically active with remarkable anti-VSV activity in CEFs. It was also found that 3.2 \u00d7 106 IU/ml chIFN-\u03b3 was present in the silkworm hemolymph (Supplementary Table S2). Previous studies have shown that antiviral units (AUs) of recombinant IFNs are closely associated with the cell type and viruses used in the reporter assay. First, we evaluated the antiviral potential of chIFN-\u03b3 against the F48E9 NDV strain. Briefly, CEFs were pre-treated with increasing concentrations of chIFN-\u03b3 for 24 h before NDV infection. The chIFN-\u03b3 treatment significantly inhibited NDV replication in CEFs in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Table S2). Next, to analyze the stages of NDV infection and the extent of viral inhibition by chIFN-\u03b3 treatment, we collected supernatant at different hours post-infection (hpi). Intriguingly, we observed that pre-treatment with chIFN-\u03b3 at a concentration of 4.19 \u00d7 103 IU/ml significantly reduced the viral replication in CEFs at a regular interval (12, 24, and 36 hpi) (Fig. 2). These results suggested that chIFN-\u03b3 has significant antiviral activity against NDV strain F48E9 in CEFs.",
            "Transcriptomics was used to explore the possible cellular and molecular signaling associated with IFN-induced immune regulation. Transcriptomes from NDV- and chIFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs were compared with mock conditions to identify DEGs. The variation in DEGs reflects immune signaling, cellular structure, molecular transportation, and biochemical pathways.",
            "Previous studies have demonstrated that chIFN-\u03b3 signaling occurs via specific IFN-\u03b3 receptors and functions as a channel between innate and adaptive immunity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]. Studies have also revealed that chIFN-\u03b3 provides protection against chicken anemia virus and MDV, further highlighting its diverse antiviral potential and suggesting that it plays a significant role in downstream signaling in the chicken immune system [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Therefore, we stimulated CEFs with silkwormderived chIFN-\u03b3 and investigated its antiviral potential in chicken fibroblasts.",
            "Additionally, we profiled the patterns of gene expression and compared them with mock conditions by RNA-seq. There was an overall moderate to high gene expression in the distinct treatment groups; in Group 1 (NDV-treated CEF vs mock), 1845 genes out of 4121 DEGs were upregulated and 2276 genes were downregulated (Fig. 3A); in Group 2 (chIFN-\u03b3-treated CEF vs mock), 365 genes out of 433 DEGs were upregulated and 68 genes were downregulated (Fig. 3B); and in Group 3 (chIFN-\u03b3 + NDV treated CEF vs mock) 3140 genes out of 6455 DEGs were upregulated and 3315 genes were downregulated (Fig. 3C). We compared chIFN-\u03b3 + NDVtreated CEFs with NDV-treated CEFs (i.e. Group 3 vs Group 4) and found that 1384 out of 1946 genes were upregulated, while 562 genes downregulated (Fig. 3D). The significant differences in gene abundance were documented and illustrated as hierarchical clustering (Fig. 4A). Briefly, the transcripts demonstrated significant differences in the treatment groups compared with the control group. Heat map analysis presented a visual comparison of the transcripts. In the NDV-treated group, significant gene upregulation occurred. A similar pattern was observed in chIFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs, but at a lower level. However, a remarkable change was seen in chIFN-\u03b3 + NDV-",

Furthermore, we used qPCR quantification to validate the pattern of expression for DEGs. The qRT-PCR results shown in Fig. 5 demonstrated that the most crucial ISGs, including viperin, MyD88, STAT1, Mx, and PKR tested in this study, are significantly upregulated. Moreover, the expressions of IL1B and JAK2 were greater in the treated group than those in the control group (adjusted P-values >0.05), which is also consistent with the findings of the RNA-seq data. Collectively, these findings strongly supported the antiviral role of ISGs in the IFN-mediated immune response. DEGs were further characterized on the basis of their abundance and fold change (Supplementary Table S1).",
            "Taken together, we observed fundamental upregulation of integral cytokine, chemokine, and antiviral genes (IL6, IL7, IL12A, IL15, STAT1, JAK2, IL1B, IL12B, JUN, SOCS3, TLR3, MX1, RSAD2, IFIH1, IRF7, MYD88, NFKB1, NFKBIA, BF1, BF2, and DMB1) in the NDV + IFN-\u03b3 group (Supplementary Table S1). These genes are linked and closely related in terms of functionality (Fig. 6). These genes are also associated with apoptosis, cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interactions, cellular proliferation. and differentiation, as well as antiviral responses. The expressions of a diverse subset of genes identified in this study are in agreement to the previously reported literature where a moderate antiviral functionality is observed against NDV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]. Moreover, chIFN-\u03b3 is unique in its functionality in the cascade of pathogenic attack against host cells, because it is significantly active in creating an overall antiviral environment against invading pathogens.",
            "In order to deeply undermine the possible functionality of the observed novel genes found in the cohort of DEGs, we further analyzed and predicted the specific functions associated with each novel gene. Briefly, both the novel gene 00068 and novel gene 00025 were hypothetical proteins Y956_03374. Similarly, the novel gene 00372 was designated as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-related protein 1-like isoform and the novel gene 00577 as paramyosin-like, while partial and novel gene 00372 is similar to PPRC1. The protein encoded by gene 00372 is identical to PPAR-gamma coactivator 1 (PPARGC1/PGC-1), a protein that is broadly involved in the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis via interaction with respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) in response to proliferative signals. It is believed that alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. In the mammals, this PRCdependent stress cascade is initiated during apoptosis and senescence; however, its exact functional role in chicken needs to be further explored.",
            "In order to classify the functions associated with the identified DEGs, GO enrichment analysis was performed. Based on sequence homology, the transcripts for DEGs were grouped into three broad categories, i.e. cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes (Fig. 7), by using DESeq2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>].",
            "The functional distribution of DEGs in each treatment group was evaluated by comparing the transcript profiles. All analysis here was subject to an adjusted P-value of <0.05. In NDV-treated CEFs, 48 out of 3465 GO terms were significant (Fig. 7A). In the chIFN-\u03b3treated CEFs, 18 out of 1730 GO terms were significant (Fig. 7B). In NDV + chIFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs, 90 out of 3886 GO terms were significant (Fig. 7C). In the NDV + chIFN-\u03b3-treated vs NDV-treated group, 26 out of 2766 GO terms were significant (Fig. 7D).",
            "Terms associated with biological processes were significantly enriched by comparing the transcriptional profiles of chIFN-\u03b3treated group with those of the control group. These biological processes include immune response, immune system process, antigen processing and presentation, regulation of innate immune response, activation of immune response, and regulation of immune system process. The cellular components included MHC protein complex, MHC class II protein complex, and membrane-related dynamics. The enriched terms associated with molecular functions were chemokine and cytokine activity, cytokine receptor binding, regulatory region DNA binding, and regulatory region nucleic acid binding (Fig. 7B). In NDV-treated CEFs, the significantly enriched GO terms in biological processes were mainly linked to regulatory processes related to nucleic acids and proteins, as well as gene expression. Among the molecular functions, cytokine activity, cytokine receptor binding, transcription factor activity, and sequence-specific DNA binding were the most significantly enriched GO terms (Fig. 7A). GO analysis of NDV + chIFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs showed that among biological processes, regulatory processes related to biosynthesis, metabolism, and nucleic acid synthesis were highly enriched. Similarly, chemokine activity, organic cyclic compound binding, heterocyclic compound binding, and catalytic activity were the most significantly enriched GO terms in molecular functions (Fig. 7C). Some of the highly significant biological processes observed in the NDV + chIFN-\u03b3 vs NDV treatment groups include immune responses, immune system processes, cytokine activity, chemokine activity, chemokine receptor binding, cytokine receptor binding, MHC protein complex, MHC class II protein complex, and antigen processing and presentation (Fig. 7D). In short, this analysis showed that distinct biological processes were enriched in all treatment groups, suggesting that diverse biological processes are initiated in response to NDV, IFN\u03b3, and NDV + IFN-\u03b3 treatment. However, further experiments are required to address these differences in a comprehensive manner.",

Similarly, cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction, herpes simplex infection, JAK-STAT, and Salmonella infection signaling pathways also demonstrated significant upregulation in terms of cytokines, interleukins, ISGs, and transcription modulators, respectively (Fig. 8D). Major genes including IL1\u03b2, IL6, IL8, CCL4, CCL5, STAT1, TLR3, IRF7, IFITM-1, IFITM-3, IFITM-5, STAT1, NF-kB, MX1, RSAD2 (viperin), MDA5, and ZAP were identified in this study (Supplementary Table S1).",

            "In the current study, we presented the transcriptomic profile of DEGs in primary fibroblasts after treatment with chIFN-\u03b3 and the release of subsequent pro-inflammatory mediators in response to the treatment. This significant response is due to sustained and swift signaling through highly specific receptor\u2013ligand interactions and expressions of chemokines and cytokines, which results in a potent antiviral environment. Surprisingly, we observed an overall increase in TLR signaling in all treatment groups and the temporal expression of numerous genes in TLR-mediated immune responses.

We reported the successful cloning, expression, and purification of chIFN-\u03b3 using the BEVS system, and presented data that confirmed the antiviral potential of chIFN-\u03b3.",
            "Type I IFNs do not provide sufficient protection against members of avian Paramyxoviridae including velogenic NDV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore IFN-\u03b3 activity against NDV in vitro in CEFs. IFN-\u03b3 plays a significant role in physiological functions, and there is evidence supporting the fundamental role of IFN-\u03b3 in the avian family of IFNs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>].",
            "A large amount of ISGs are induced by chIFN-\u03b3, which changes the traditional view that primary CEFs are optimally responsive to IFN-\u03b3 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>]. In fact, a previous study found that chIFN-\u03b3 had antiviral activity against MDV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. It has been suggested that chIFN\u03b3 treatment elicits a broad set of antiviral ISGs, especially in the viperin gene (RSAD2), a potent antiviral gene that is expressed in response to viral pathogens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>]. Additionally, overexpression of RSAD2 in IFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs further confirmed the induction of ISGs following chIFN-\u03b3 treatment in vitro. Furthermore, studies have also shown that in chicken IFNs, cell-type specificity is unusual and distinct from mammalian IFNs in receptor\u2013ligand interactions. It has recently been shown that chIFN-\u03b3 induces ISGs and sustains a potent antiviral environment in host cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>]. Interestingly, all three types of chicken IFNs (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3) are upregulated in response to NDV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. However, upon infection with velogenic NDV, IFN-\u03b3 is significantly upgraded in the bursa of Fabricius, while expression of IFN-\u03b3 does not markedly reduce the proliferation and replication of NDV in vitro [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. Here, GO and KEGG analyses revealed overlaying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Mx, one of the most significant ISGs in host\u2013pathogen interactions, is mainly responsible for creating a barrier against different bacterial and viral pathogens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. The upregulation of Mx expression in response to chIFN-\u03b3 treatment is characteristic for all ISGs and confirms ISG expression in vivo.",
            "Microarray and RNA-seq technologies have been used to investigate the effect of type I chicken interferon (IFN-\u03b1) treatment on ISGs in primary fibroblast cells, showing that treatment with IFN\u03b1 causes significant upregulation of ISGs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Expression of IFNinducible transmembrane protein-1 (IFITM-1) following IFN treatment further showed that it is possible to stop viral propagation by simply obstructing the entry into a cell [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>]. It has also been reported that changes in cell membrane fluidity are due to IFITM whereby it either generates curvature in the membrane or interferes with the cholesterol homeostasis within the host cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>]. We observed that the upregulation of IFITM-1 in chIFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs further increased the sequential expression of ISGs post-IFN treatment. More research is required to further explore the potential role of chIFN-\u03b3 as a novel and potent therapy against viral pathogens in the poultry industry.",

Fascinatingly, the same phenomenon was observed in IFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs, where significant upregulation of STAT1, IRF-1, and other associated genes was reported. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed distinct biological features in all treatment groups. In order to replicate in the host cells, viruses need to breach the immune and metabolic processes of the host cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. We found this to be the case when we observed significant variations in cellular metabolic processes (i.e. 1281 genes upregulated and 1033 genes downregulated) in NDV-treated CEFs. However, in response to IFN-\u03b3 treatment, the most highly significant GO terms were mainly associated with immunity. Interestingly, in NDV + IFN-\u03b3-treated cells, a significant number of DEGs were found to enrich in both metabolic and immune processes. Moreover, co-treatment of chIFN-\u03b3 and NDV synergistically upregulated ISG expression compared with only NDV treatment. Upregulation of crucial biological processes, key immune responses, and metabolic processes in this context requires further investigation. Nonetheless, our findings revealed the fundamental cellular and molecular basis involved in chIFN-\u03b3-mediated immune response.",

MDA5 mimics the function of RIG-1, which is absent in Aves, by recognizing both long and short dsRNA. Therefore, communication between the laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) and MDA5 induces a potent antiviral response in chickens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>]. Significant upregulation of MDA5 in response to chIFN-\u03b3 treatment suggested that chIFN-\u03b3 stimulates PRRs that in turn elicit an antiviral environment against RNA viruses (e.g. AIV, NDV, etc.). Additionally, as type-1 transmembrane proteins, TLRs are highly conserved [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>].

Interestingly, as the chicken genome is devoid of TLR8 (non-functional) and TLR9, only TLR3 and TLR7 are crucial in RNA viral recognition and sensing [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c68\" href=\"#r68\">68</a>]. Overexpression and upregulation of TLR7 in response to chIFN-\u03b3 further changes the role of chIFN-\u03b3 in the avian innate immune response in primary cells. Considerable upregulation of TLRs post-chIFN-\u03b3 treatment in CEFs further increases the expression of ISGs in a temporal fashion. Additional comprehensive research is necessary to evaluate chIFN\u03b3 as an alternative, effective, and unique therapy for the poultry industry.",
            "The expressions of crucial genes related to innate immunity identified in the present study are exactly the same as those observed in previously performed studies where similar patterns of gene expression were shown in CEFs treated with chIFN-\u03b1 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Surprisingly, the upregulation of IFIT5, STAT1, Mx1, RSAD2, IL15, ZC3HAV1, and IRF8 further suggested that a common pattern of ISGs expression occurred in both IFN-\u03b1- and IFN-\u03b3-mediated immune response in CEFs. Additionally, the upregulation of potent ISGs, including RSAD2 (viperin), IFIT5, and Mx1, demonstrated that an antiviral environment has been generated in the IFN-treated cells, which could stop the propagation of viral pathogen. Similarly, upregulation of identical chemokines, cytokines, and transcription modulators strongly suggested that patterns of gene expression are in common between IFN-\u03b1- and IFN-\u03b3-treated CEFs. Although this study primarily focused on IFN-\u03b3, a more precise and comprehensive study including a broad set of chicken IFNs can now be possible to elucidate the IFN-mediated immune response in chicken cells. More work is required to understand the innate immune signaling cascade associated with type II IFNs. Here, we identified some uncharacterized genes that are involved in avian immunity. Furthermore, in vitro CEF treatment with chIFN-\u03b3 resulted in a rapid surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokine gene expression is widely used as a landmark of immune signaling due to its crucial role in immune signaling. We identified some previously described genes including chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1; ENSGALT00000003670) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>]. Chemokines are essential cytokines that are critical for avian immune responses where they govern the transportation of myeloid and lymphoid cells to the target organs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>]. CCL1 is secreted by monocytes and plays an essential role in the activation of macrophages and T lymphocytes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>]. Likewise, CCL20 is involved in eliciting early immune responses by recruiting lymphoid cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. Similarly, upregulation of CCL1, CCL4, and CCL5 in CEFs suggested that they play fundamental roles in innate immunity in chickens.",
            "The expressions of crucial genes, including TLR3, TLR7, IL1B, IRF7, IL8, STAT1, and MHC class I and II molecules, are characteristic of NDV infection in chicken cells. However, in previously performed studies, a significant expression of type I IFNs (INF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) was observed against NDV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. Surprisingly, in our experimental settings, we were unable to observe this response. This may be due to multiple reasons, including the use of different viral genotypes, the origin and source of virus, and the type of cells used to determine the NDV-mediated pathogenesis in different bird species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. Collectively, based on our experimental findings, we can postulate that the temporal induction of IFNs in response to NDV infection in CEFs is dependent on certain factors, including viral genotype, viral source, cell type, mode of infection, and time points of NDV infection in cells. CEFs are an invaluable tool for investigating the interactions between avian viral pathogens and immunerelated genes. Since viral infection can be controlled in a cell culture system, specific changes in molecular and cellular architecture can be observed and characterized. Previous studies have demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 inhibits influenza virus replication [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>]. Different research groups have tried to investigate the antiviral role of IFNs, but none have managed to elucidate the chIFN-\u03b3-induced antiviral response against NDV infection in CEFs. In this work, in order to evaluate the immune state elicited by chIFN-\u03b3 in CEFs, the released NDV viral particles were counted in culture medium with and without chIFN-\u03b3 treatment. A reduction in viral load indicated that chIFN-\u03b3 actively reduced the NDV viral population. Significantly, published reports showed that ISGs have antiviral activities against NDV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. These results suggested that stimulation of the innate immune response prior to NDV infection inhibits viral propagation and the release of viral progeny. These findings provided a better insight into the innate immune responses triggered by deadly viral pathogens.",
            "Innate immune signaling in Aves is an extremely diverse, multifaceted, integrated, and precise process that relies on many different aspects. All the genes observed in this study govern protein interactions and are directly associated with avian immunity. However, additional investigation and validation of a cohort of immune-associated genes are required to understand the avian immune response against invading viral pathogens. An extensive and inclusive study involving a broad range of genes related to immunity and several IFNs that compare and connect the unified function is required to provide a comprehensive understanding of the innate immune response cascade. Additional investigations using animal models to evaluate whether related arrays of immune response exist in chicken against chIFN-\u03b3 are also significant and will further provide a deeper insight into immune signaling in Aves."
