        "abstract": "In the present study, a new hepatic tissue\u2010origin cell line from European eel Anguilla anguilla has been developed and characterized. This cell line designated EL has been maintained in Leibovitz L\u201015 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum over 72 months, and subcultured more than 90 times. The EL cell line consisted predominantly of fibroblast\u2010like cells, which could survive over 100 days in vitro, and could grow at 15\u201332\u00b0C. The optimum temperature for growth was 27\u00b0C. The chromosome analysis revealed a modal diploid karyotype of 2n = 38. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by the 18S recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The susceptibility test indicated significant cytopathic effects in the EL cells with regard to the Rana grylio virus and the Herpesvirus anguillae. The viral replication was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Following poly (I:C) exposure, the expression levels of the immune\u2010 related molecules interferon regulatory factor\u20107 (irf7) and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2) were downregulated in EL cells, whereas the expression levels of the rf3 and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were upregulated. All four genes were significantly upregulated following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data suggested the application of EL cell line for viral identification, as well as for immunodiagnosis and pharmacological targeting.",

            "Primary cell culture and cell line development<br/><br/>Hepatic cells migrated outwards from several tissue explants on the third day following inoculation (Figure 1A). In the second week of incubation, radial outgrowths were observed, although no monolayer was formed in the primary culture for a period of 8 weeks. A confluent monolayer appeared at the fifth subculture, and the interval of the first subcultures varied from 30 to 40 days. The subcultures initially consisted of almost the same number of fibroblast\u2010like and epithelial\u2010like cells, as well as a limited number of stellate\u2010like cells. However, only fibroblast\u2010like cells were left after 10 subcultures. The multiplication interval was gradually reduced, following continuous subculture. This interval was estimated from 14 to 20 days between the 20th and 30th subculture and from 4 to 6 days after the 60th subculture (Figures 2A and 2B). The EL cell line was anchorage\u2010dependent, and resulted mainly in the formation of fibroblast\u2010like cells that were maintained in L\u201015 containing 10% FBS (Figure 1B). The culture medium was changed every week and the EL cells were able to survive for 100 days or more in vitro (Figure 1C). From its initiation, this cell line was kept in in vitro culture over 72 months continuously, and was subcultured for more than 90 times. The 60th subculture of EL cells recovered from liquid nitrogen storage and could grow into a confluent culture in 2 days. The average viability of these cells was estimated from 75% to 85%."

        "discussion": [
            "The EL cell line required a considerably large time period for its primary culture and early subcultures. The cells indicated prolonged multiplication intervals on more than 50 passages compared with those noted in other reported marine fish cell lines (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFryer_1994_a\" href=\"#rFryer_1994_a\">Fryer and Lannan, 1994</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLakra_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rLakra_et+al_2011_a\">Lakra et al, 2011</a>). These findings could be attributed to the origin of the experimental animals used. As a European\u2010origin catadromous teleost (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSchmidt_1923_a\" href=\"#rSchmidt_1923_a\">Schmidt, 1923</a>), the artificial reproduction of A. anguilla is a difficult task. Since the wild\u2010type embryo and the neonatal leptocephalus are mainly present in the oceans, the glass eels are the predominant catches collected in the European coastal waters. However, their export was restricted after being considered endangered species in 2009. Therefore, the elvers are the youngest eel to be collected from the fish farmers in China. The 20 g elvers had been shown to be at their growth peak in the ponds (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_1997_a\" href=\"#rHuang_1997_a\">Huang and Cheng, 1997</a>) and their tissues and cells were already highly differentiated. Furthermore, the several types of parasites discovered in eel viscera and muscles may also negatively affect the growth potential of early in vitro cultures."

            "In the present study, a new hepatic tissue\u2010origin cell line from European eel Anguilla anguilla has been developed and characterized. This cell line designated EL has been maintained in Leibovitz L\u201015 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum over 72 months, and subcultured more than 90 times. The EL cell line consisted predominantly of fibroblast\u2010like cells, which could survive over 100 days in vitro, and could grow at 15\u201332\u00b0C. The optimum temperature for growth was 27\u00b0C. The chromosome analysis revealed a modal diploid karyotype of 2n = 38. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by the 18S recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The susceptibility test indicated significant cytopathic effects in the EL cells with regard to the Rana grylio virus and the Herpesvirus anguillae. The viral replication was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Following poly (I:C) exposure, the expression levels of the immune\u2010 related molecules interferon regulatory factor\u20107 (irf7) and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2) were downregulated in EL cells, whereas the expression levels of the rf3 and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were upregulated. All four genes were significantly upregulated following inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data suggested the application of EL cell line for viral identification, as well as for immunodiagnosis and pharmacological targeting.",

In the second week of incubation, radial outgrowths were observed, although no monolayer was formed in the primary culture for a period of 8 weeks. A confluent monolayer appeared at the fifth subculture, and the interval of the first subcultures varied from 30 to 40 days. The subcultures initially consisted of almost the same number of fibroblast\u2010like and epithelial\u2010like cells, as well as a limited number of stellate\u2010like cells.

The EL cell line was anchorage\u2010dependent, and resulted mainly in the formation of fibroblast\u2010like cells that were maintained in L\u201015 containing 10% FBS (Figure 1B). The culture medium was changed every week and the EL cells were able to survive for 100 days or more in vitro (Figure 1C).

The maximum growth rate was obtained at 27\u00b0C (Figures 2A and 2B). From 24 to 120 h following cell inoculation, the passage of 66 EL cells exhibited a logarithmic phase of growth with a PDT of 29.64 h, and thereafter a stagnate phase was noted (Figure 2B). In contrast to these observations, the passage 28 EL cells presented a logarithmic growth phase between 48 and 192 h after inoculation with a PDT of 84.68 h (Figure 2A).",

Chromosome analysis indicated a distribution of the chromosome number of the EL cell line. This number varied from 26 to 50 (Figure 3B).",
            "The origin of the EL cell line was confirmed by the 18S rRNA gene analysis. An expected PCR product of 1,714 bp was obtained using specific amplification of 18S rRNA from the extracted total genomic DNA. This was proven 100% identical to the published A. anguilla 18s rRNA sequence (GenBank: FM946070.1). The homologous analysis further indicated a complete match with A. anguilla.",
            "Both of the two tested viruses were able to cause cytopathic effect (CPE) on the EL cells. At 72 h after viral infection, the cells that were infected with HVA exhibited increased mortality.

The cell death was",

The particles of both viruses were found in the cytoplasm and the nuclei and were determined by electron microscopy. Expanded viral factories (VF) were noted in the RGV\u2010infected cells, in which electron density was lower and/or higher than that of the surrounding cytoplasm (Figure 5A) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhang_2012_a\" href=\"#rZhang_2012_a\">Zhang and Gui, 2012</a>). In contrast to RGV\u2010infected cells, the VFs in HVA\u2010infected cells were localized in a vast area of the nuclei (Figure 5D). Viral particles were also found dispersed in the cytoplasm in both groups (Figures 5B and 5E). Multiple crystalline\u2010 arranged RGV particles were found nearby the VF (Figure 5C), and numerous empty capsids and incomplete viral particles were noted within the HVA inclusions (Figure 5F).",

The maximum decrease was estimated to 58.75% and 67.51%, respectively, at 12 h post\u2010stimulation (P < 0.01) (Figures 6A and 6C). In contrast to these two genes, the expression of irf3 and CYP450 was upregulated. The expression levels of the irf3 transcripts reached the peak at 6 h post\u2010stimulation with an increase of 2.52\u2010fold (P < 0.05) and subsequently returned to the initial levels (Figure 6B).

The expression levels of irf7 returned subsequently to the initial levels (Figure 6A). The expression levels of irf3 were significantly upregulated from 6 to 12 h and the highest ratio was estimated to 3.62\u2010fold (12 h, P < 0.01).

        "Discussion": [
            "The EL cell line required a considerably large time period for its primary culture and early subcultures. The cells indicated prolonged multiplication intervals on more than 50 passages compared with those noted in other reported marine fish cell lines (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFryer_1994_a\" href=\"#rFryer_1994_a\">Fryer and Lannan, 1994</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLakra_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rLakra_et+al_2011_a\">Lakra et al, 2011</a>). These findings could be attributed to the origin of the experimental animals used. As a European\u2010origin catadromous teleost (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSchmidt_1923_a\" href=\"#rSchmidt_1923_a\">Schmidt, 1923</a>), the artificial reproduction of A. anguilla is a difficult task. Since the wild\u2010type embryo and the neonatal leptocephalus are mainly present in the oceans, the glass eels are the predominant catches collected in the European coastal waters. However, their export was restricted after being considered endangered species in 2009. Therefore, the elvers are the youngest eel to be collected from the fish farmers in China. The 20 g elvers had been shown to be at their growth peak in the ponds (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_1997_a\" href=\"#rHuang_1997_a\">Huang and Cheng, 1997</a>) and their tissues and cells were already highly differentiated. Furthermore, the several types of parasites discovered in eel viscera and muscles may also negatively affect the growth potential of early in vitro cultures.",
            "The karyotype analysis revealed that 57% of the passage 65 EL cells presented a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 38, which was identical with the model number of A. anguilla (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_1999_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_1999_a\">Yang et al, 1999</a>). Although the EL strain did not exhibit the ability to form neoplasms in vitro, its aneuploidy implied the possibility of immortality (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rChen_et+al_2005_a\">Chen et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBryson_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rBryson_et+al_2006_a\">Bryson et al, 2006</a>). The EL cells were not sensitive to slight osmolality changes, which may be due to the euryhalinity of A. anguilla (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSchmidt_1923_a\" href=\"#rSchmidt_1923_a\">Schmidt, 1923</a>).",
            "In the present study, the cell line sample that exhibited the longest longevity was retained for over 6 months at 20\u00b0C. The cell lines that are maintained in vitro for a long time period exhibit mutations that may alter their original functional characteristics that have been identified at earlier passage levels (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYu_et+al_1997_a\" href=\"#rYu_et+al_1997_a\">Yu et al, 1997</a>). Their behavior modes can also be altered (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHughes_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rHughes_et+al_2007_a\">Hughes et al, 2007</a>). Two massive cell deaths were noted at the 3rd, 48th, 49th, and 50th subculture, which suggested the optimal time periods for the intrinsic in vitro transformation of the EL cell line (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDoyle_2000_a\" href=\"#rDoyle_2000_a\">Doyle and Griffiths, 2000</a>). Long\u2010term subculture could also place selective pressure on cell proliferation, which may explain the disappearance of the epithelial\u2010like and stellate\u2010like cells during subcultivation.",
            "Nearly, all fish cell lines are anchorage\u2010dependent and a large number of primary cultures have been prepared from fish liver compared with other types of solid fish tissues (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBaksi_1990_a\" href=\"#rBaksi_1990_a\">Baksi and Frazier, 1990</a>). A surprising feature noted in certain species was the inability of hepatocytes to attach and spread using growth\u2010related substrates, which suggested that hepatic cell lines could release attachment and spreading factors that promote the preparation of primary hepatocyte cultures (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBols_1991_a\" href=\"#rBols_1991_a\">Bols and Lee, 1991</a>). Similar phenomena were also observed during the early development of the EL cell line. The cell line required considerably higher inoculum density during adherence to a glabrous inner surface of the culture flask, while cells with lower density remained at the bottom and could grow into a confluent monolayer following removal of the supernatant. Therefore, the asymmetrical subculture method was selected.",
            "The susceptibility of the EL cell line to HVA and RGV infection was demonstrated in the present study. The infection course required a considerable time period in EL cells, indicating the potential for HVA\u2010prevention studies compared with former HVA tests using the EO cell line (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGe_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rGe_et+al_2014_a\">Ge et al, 2014</a>) Iridoviruses are common pathogens detected in A. japonica (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSorimachi_1987_a\" href=\"#rSorimachi_1987_a\">Sorimachi and Egusa, 1987</a>) and other aquaculture species in the Fujian province (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_1999_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_1999_a\">Yang et al, 1999</a>). The present study indicated that the EL cells could be used as a universal model for viral isolation.",
            "The rapid response kinetics of the gene expression levels of various immune factors with regard to in vitro or in vivo inflammatory stimulation has been confirmed repeatedly in teleosts (Sudhakumari et al, 2005; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHaddad_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rHaddad_et+al_2008_a\">Haddad et al, 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMaehr_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rMaehr_et+al_2013_a\">Maehr et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2014_a\">Huang et al, 2014</a></a>). However, the mechanism of inflammatory\u2010induced immune modulation remains ambiguous. Recently, cell lines have been used as tools for functional analysis of fish innate immunity genes. The IRF family members play critical roles in the cellular differentiation of hematopoietic cells, in the regulation of gene expression in response to pathogen\u2010derived danger signals, and consequently in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTamura_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rTamura_et+al_2008_a\">Tamura et al, 2008</a>). Irf3 and irf7 are highly expressed in the teleost liver (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYao_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rYao_et+al_2012_a\">Yao et al, 2012</a>). Irf3 has been reported to be upregulated in both peripheral blood leukocytes and in vivo models following poly (I:C) or LPS stimulation in A. anguilla. This was confirmed in the present study, by the alterations of the irf7 levels following LPS induction. It is interesting to note that the expression levels of irf7 were downregulated in response to poly (I:C) in the present study, compared with a previous in vivo study (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2014_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2014_a\">Huang et al, 2014</a></a>). This may be due to the absence of some protein members that participate in multiple cross\u2010talk in vivo signaling pathways.",
            "The CYP gene superfamily members are usually involved in the detoxification of exogenous chemicals and the metabolism of various endogenous substrates (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cUno_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rUno_et+al_2012_a\">Uno et al, 2012</a>). Since the 1980s, hepatic expression of CYPs in Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum 1792) and other fishes has been considered a common biomarker to assess contamination of the aquatic environment (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWinston_et+al_1988_a\" href=\"#rWinston_et+al_1988_a\">Winston et al, 1988</a>; Nilsen et al, 1998; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBugiak_2009_a\" href=\"#rBugiak_2009_a\">Bugiak and Weber, 2009</a>). In the present study, the expression levels of CYP450 indicated a significant long\u2010term upregulation following poly (I:C) and/or LPS exposure, indicating that the EL cell line could retain the intrinsic characteristics of its hepatic origin. This renders the EL cell line an ideal model for toxicological and pharmacological analysis of aquatic pollutants."

        "Conclusion": [
            "In summary, the present study demonstrated that EL is a diploid cell line of A. anguilla that has been established from its hepatic tissues. This cell line can be potentially used for the studies of infectious viral diseases of Anguillidae, and for the studies that investigate the protection of this endangered species."
