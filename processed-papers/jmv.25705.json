        "abstract": "It has been more than 1 month since the first 2019\u2010nCoV infected person was diagnosed. So far, 42 638 people have been diagnosed as 2019\u2010nCoV pneumonia, which also known as Wuhan pneumonia, among them, 7333 are severe cases, 1016 patients died, and only 3996 patients have been cured in the mainland of China (Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan were excluded).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] All 31 provincial\u2010level regions and the Xinjiang Production Corps have the confirmed cases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Hubei province, where believed to be the origin of Wuhan pneumonia outbreak, suffers the most, with 31 728 confirmed cases and 974 death cases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] The trend of cumulative cases is soaring, including 24 other countries outside of China had confirmed cases. With a remarkable notice that the total number of cases has far exceeded the number during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) period. The first case of 2019\u2010 nCoV pneumonia was linked to wild animal trading in the Huanan seafood market in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Zhou et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] found the initial source of 2019\u2010nCoV probably originated from the Chinese horseshoe bat since the novel coronavirus was 96% identical to a bat coronavirus at a whole genome level. This coronavirus, which has not been identified in humans previously, had been detected from patients in Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and it was the first case for human infection with 2019\u2010 nCoV from wild animals.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] Recently, Wu et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] estimated 75 815 individuals would be infected in Wuhan, with an uncertainty range from 37 304 to 130 330 by using the susceptible\u2010exposed\u2010 infectious\u2010recovered model. While the variation of the virus is still under surveillance.",
