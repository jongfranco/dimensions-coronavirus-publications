        "discussion": [
            "PEDV is the major etiological agent for the recent outbreaks of piglet diarrhea that has caused devastating economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Traditional vaccine strategy cannot either provide a full protection for piglets or ensure a satisfying control of PEDV infection and spreading. Therefore, the development of safe, effective, and inexpensive antiviral drugs remains a great challenge to modern medicine. PR is a natural isoflavonoid extracted from Gegen in the traditional Chinese herb medicine. As a potential antiviral drug, effects of PR on PEDV infection are unknown. To date, although the proteomic technique has been widely applied to virus\u2013 host interaction studies, little information is available about the protein profiles of piglets infected with PEDV. In the current work, we determine the effect of PR on PEDV both in vitro and in vivo with the goal of elucidating the underlying mechanisms by a proteomic analysis."
        ],
        "conclusion": [
            "PR inhibited PEDV replication both in vitro and in vivo and alleviated the decrease of growth performance in piglets. Additionally, the quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that PR administration regulated the interferon signaling pathway in PEDV-infected piglets. Furthermore, PR attenuated NF-\u03baB activation in the ileum. Taken together, these findings suggest that PR protected against PEDV infection via regulating the interferon and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Our results are expected to aid in the development of effective antiviral feed additives and also have important implications for the production of veterinary drugs and human medicine."

Approximately 200 \u03bcg of proteins from each sample was subjected to filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) trypsin digestion to generate peptides. Briefly, protein samples were diluted to 100 \u03bcl with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and disulfide bonds in protein were reduced by treating the sample with 2 \u03bcl of 500 mM DL-dithiothreitol (DTT) in 100 \u03bcl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 150 min at 37\u25e6C (the final concentration of DDT was 10 mM), and then alkylated with 14 \u03bcl of 500 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature (25\u25e6C) for 40 min in the dark (the final concentration of IAA was 60 mM). The detergent, DTT, and other low-molecular-weight components were removed by repeated dilution in 100 mM Tris-HCl UA buffer (containing 8 M urea, pH 8.5), followed by filtration through 10-kDa ultrafiltration units (Pall Corporation, USA). The filters were washed three times with 100 \u03bcl of UA buffer, followed by twice washes with 100 \u03bcl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate.

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "PEDV is the major etiological agent for the recent outbreaks of piglet diarrhea that has caused devastating economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Traditional vaccine strategy cannot either provide a full protection for piglets or ensure a satisfying control of PEDV infection and spreading. Therefore, the development of safe, effective, and inexpensive antiviral drugs remains a great challenge to modern medicine. PR is a natural isoflavonoid extracted from Gegen in the traditional Chinese herb medicine. As a potential antiviral drug, effects of PR on PEDV infection are unknown. To date, although the proteomic technique has been widely applied to virus\u2013 host interaction studies, little information is available about the protein profiles of piglets infected with PEDV. In the current work, we determine the effect of PR on PEDV both in vitro and in vivo with the goal of elucidating the underlying mechanisms by a proteomic analysis.",
            "PEDV can cause acute and watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in neonatal piglets [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>], and its adverse effect on growth performance of piglets was demonstrated by Curry et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]. Consistently, in the present study, PEDV infection resulted in a significant reduction in piglet ADG, but PR administration substantially alleviated the reduction of ADG, indicating that PR has a positive effect on the growth performance of PEDV-infected piglets. Although the reduction in diarrhea rate was not statistically significant due to the small sample size, the decreasing trend in diarrhea",
            "rate and the weaker clinical symptoms indicated that the piglets in the PEDV + PR group were recovering better from illness. Similarly, dietary supplementation with soy isoflavone increased ADG and reduced the incidence of diarrhea in weaned piglets challenged with lipopolysaccharide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. These results support the notion that isoflavonoid could be used to treat diarrhea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>]. Our findings further demonstrated that PR could alleviate reduction in the growth performance of PEDV-infected piglets.",
            "In the present study, the mRNA levels of genes that encoded for the N and M proteins of PEDV were decreased regardless of whether PR was administered after the entry of the virus into Vero cells in vitro or before PEDV infection in piglets. Similar results were found for the N and M protein levels, which were determined by the proteomic analysis (data not shown). These results indicated that PR could inhibit the replication of PEDV at different stages of its life cycle. Nevertheless, additional comprehensive studies are needed to verify this notion. In the current work, in vitro studies were performed with monkey cells and in vivo studies with piglets. Although they are different species, both of them are highly susceptible to PEDV, and PR could inhibit the replication of PEDV in both species. This suggests that PR was effective against PEDV in vitro and in vivo. Jejunal and ileal villus enterocytes are the main targets of PEDV replication [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>], and PEDV also appears in feces and mesenteric lymph nodes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>]. Consistently, we found that the piglet small intestine was the main target of PEDV. Intriguingly, the mRNA levels of N and M genes were extremely high in the ileum of piglets, even higher than those in the jejunum.",
            "Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of N and M genes were also high in colonic contents. Importantly, PR administration decreased the expression of the viral genes in the ileum, jejunal, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes, indicating that PR plays an antiviral role in a large part of the gut. Previous studies showed that PR inhibited HIV-1 replication and human respiratory syncytial virus activities in vitro [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Some medicinal herbal extracts, such as oleanane triterpenes from the flowers of Camellia japonica, Sophorae radix, Acanthopanacis cortex, Sanguisorbae radix, and Torilis fructus, can inhibit PEDV replication [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]. To date, there is little information regarding an anti-PEDV effect of PR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that PR inhibited PEDV replication both in vitro and in vivo.",
            "Inflammation and disease progression are initiated by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines during viral infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. A previous study showed that the mRNA levels for pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF\u03b1) were increased in Vero cells after PEDV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>]. MCP1/CCL2, which is a chemokine, was also increased in response to PEDV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. Likewise, we found that IL8, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP1 expressions were increased post PEDV infection in Vero cells and that the concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 were increased in the ileum of PEDV-infected piglets, further substantiating the notion that PEDV could induce inflammatory response. Interestingly, inflammation appeared to be alleviated in the PEDV + PR group, as indicated by the decreased expression of the inflammatory cytokines. This result indicated that PR possessed an anti-inflammatory effect, which is",
            "consistent with the previous reports that the expression of genes for inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) were reduced by PR administration under inflammatory conditions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. Collectively, these findings support the view that PR can mitigate inflammation induced by PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo.",
            "Cluster analyses are usually used to build groups of functionally related genes or proteins, thereby interpreting and identifying DRPs among different groups. In this study, nearly all of the overlapped DRPs (29/31) between the PEDV and Control groups or between the PEDV + PR and PEDV groups were reversely regulated by PR intervention, which could be clearly visualized by the heat-maps. Several functional enrichment analyses highlighted the importance of the interferon signaling pathway. Specifically, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and several ISGs were selectively upregulated at mRNA or protein levels in response to PEDV infection. This result is inconsistent with the previous report that PEDV antagonized interferon response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>]. Because almost all of the previous studies were conducted in vitro, the inconsistency may be attributed to the fact that results of in vitro experiments may not accurately reflect the situation in vivo. Moreover, an in vivo study performed by Annamalai et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>] demonstrated that serum IFN-\u03b1 could be augmented at the early stage of PEDV infection. Of particular interest, PR administration appeared to regulate the interferon signaling pathway by maintaining the expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and ISGs at their normal physiological levels. It is noteworthy that warranted to determine whether PR exerts an antiviral effect by regulating GBP2 expression. Overall, these results indicated that PR regulated the interferon signaling pathway in PEDVinfected piglets.",
            "The NF-\u03baB pathway plays a central role in the regulation of immune responses. Such a function of NF-\u03baB in PEDV infection is supported by several lines of evidence [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>]. Our results showed that PEDV induced NF-\u03baB activation in vivo and that PR supplementation inhibited the NF\u03baB activation, which may contribute to the decrease in the expression of interferon-related genes and the production of cytokines. This is consistent with the previous findings that PR has an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro and in vivo [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. Therefore, we suggest that PR is beneficial for restoring immune homeostasis after PEDV infection by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation."
        ],
        "CONCLUSION": [
            "PR inhibited PEDV replication both in vitro and in vivo and alleviated the decrease of growth performance in piglets. Additionally, the quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that PR administration regulated the interferon signaling pathway in PEDV-infected piglets. Furthermore, PR attenuated NF-\u03baB activation in the ileum. Taken together, these findings suggest that PR protected against PEDV infection via regulating the interferon and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Our results are expected to aid in the development of effective antiviral feed additives and also have important implications for the production of veterinary drugs and human medicine."

        "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a devastating enteric disease characterized by vomiting, anorexia, acute severe watery diarrhea, and dehydration, results in extremely high rates of morbidity and mortality in newborn piglets [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]",
        "To assess the role of PR on Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection, an in vitro study was performed with Vero cells",
        "We found that IL8, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 expressions were increased post Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection in Vero cells and that the concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 were increased in the ileum of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-infected piglets, further substantiating the notion that Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus could induce inflammatory response",
        "Our results showed that Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus induced nuclear factor kappa-B activation in vivo and that PR supplementation inhibited the NF\u03baB activation, which may contribute to the decrease in the expression of interferon-related genes and the production of cytokines",
        "PR attenuated nuclear factor kappa-B activation in the ileum. These findings suggest that PR protected against Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection via regulating the interferon and nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway",
        "Our results are expected to aid in the development of effective antiviral feed additives and have important implications for the production of veterinary drugs and human medicine"
