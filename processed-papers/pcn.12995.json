            "The future of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is still unclear. The outbreak emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread to other region in China as well as cities in other countries. It is forecasted that outbreaks in major cities globally could be inevitable without large-scale intervention[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. An increasing number of health professionals will encounter infected patients. The medical works in Wuhan are already facing overwhelming pressure, overwork, frustration[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and they need timely mental health care[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. This is identical to the H1N1 pandemic in Japan 20094,5. On February 11, 2020, one quarantine officer was infected with COVID-19 in Japan. For health professionals, protection against getting infected is a priority. Additionally, it is also important to ensure that health professionals are willing to continue work, so that hospitals can keep functioning. Here, I introduce my experience from the H1N1 pandemic in Japan during 2009."
