        "abstract": "Introduction: Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a surface bound ectopeptidase that is commonly known as CD26 or adenosine deaminase binding protein. DPP-4 is membrane anchored but it can be cleaved by numerous proteases including matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs). DPP-4 is expressed by endothelial and epithelial cells, the kidney, intestine and cells of the immune system; it has a broad spectrum of biological functions in immune regulation, cancer biology and glucose metabolism. Areas covered: This article sheds light on the functions of DPP-4, the molecular mechanisms that govern its expression, it\u2019s role in the pathogenesis of common respiratory illnesses and potential as a therapeutic target. Expert opinion: DPP-4 has a deleterious role in respiratory disease. Its biological functions, key molecular pathways, interactions and associations are slowly being elucidated. Progressing our knowledge of the role of this multi-faceted molecule may yield vital and novel therapies for respiratory diseases such as lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",

            "Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a surface bound ectopeptidase that is commonly known as CD26 or adenosine deaminase binding protein.

            "Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4/CD26 (DPP-4) is a highly specific cellsurface ectopeptidase, which cleaves dipeptides from the N-terminus, where a proline residue is in a penultimate position [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. DPP-4 will preferentially cleave proline at this residue, however, it can also act on alanine and glycine, albeit less rapidly [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. It has many facets apart from its catalytic capabilities. DPP4 is an integral (type II) transmembrane protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], whereas circulating DPP-4 has also been documented and can be measured in plasma [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), monocytes, lymphocytes, and hepatocytes are purported to be sources of soluble DPP-4 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Its removal from the cell surface can be mediated by a number of proteases including, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Shed circulating DPP4 has nominally been assigned as a novel adipokine that can act in both a paracrine and endocrine manner [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], and a novel receptor has been characterized. Furthermore, circulating soluble DPP-4 is elevated in the obese and patients with type II diabetes [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",
            "DPP4 is widely expressed in a diverse number of tissues throughout the body including, the kidney, small intestine and lung. It is expressed in numerous immune cells and both the epithelium and endothelium. In the vasculature, DPP-4 is expressed by the venous capillary bed and the endothelium of venules [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Since vascular endothelium expresses high amounts of DPP4, endothelium-derived DPP4 may notably contribute to plasma DPP4 pool. The effects of DPP4 inhibition on endothelial functions have been variable, partially due to the differences in protocols used which are difficult to replicate and usually differ from patient-to-patient.

            "In rats, DPP-4/CD26 activity exhibited in the lungs is the second highest of all organs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Immunohistochemical studies were conducted to determine the location of DPP-4 expression within the respiratory system. DPP-4 is largely absent in epithelial cells lining the nasal cavity back toward the conducting airways. There is, however, modest expression in the distal airway. In addition, DPP-4 expression was localized to mononuclear and serous cells within the submucosal glands. Expression of DPP-4 was also noted in type I and II parenchymal cells and the vascular endothelium [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>].",
            "with a variety of proteins, including the structural proteins fibronectin and collagen, gp120 protein HIV viral protein, and adenosine deaminase. Interestingly, DPP-4 truncates many peptides with potential biomedical functions; its substrates include, luteinizing hormone \u03b1 chain, human chorionic gonadotrophin \u03b1 chain, macrophage-derived chemokine, IP10, insulin-like growth factor-1, and growth hormone-releasing factor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. In addition, DPP-4 may function as a tumor biomarker for a variety of conditions including, solid tumors, leukemia, viral and inflammatory diseases. One of its most documented roles is in glucose homeostasis via proteolytic inactivation of incretins. DPP-4 inhibitors are widely used in clinical practice and are known to improve glucose tolerance and islet cell function [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. The key structural features of DPP-4 are detailed in Figure 1"

        "2.2. DPP-4 transgenic mouse models": [
            "Transgenic models of global gene knockout and conditional knockouts offer a wealth of information on protein function. The knockout of peptidases of the same family, such as DPP-9, is embryonically lethal. However, fibroblast activated peptide (FAP) and DPP-4 knockout mice are viable [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], and macroscopically phenotypically normal [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Moreover, fat fed DPP-4\u2212/- mice are resistant to the development of obesity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Following a glucose challenge, these mice have improved tolerance, intimating their role in glucose metabolism and metabolic syndrome [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. DPP-4 has some influence on scarring and fibrinolysis as knockout mice have less fibrotic livers in injury models [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Conditional knockout mice can be generated where the gene expression is limited to specific cells or tissues. However, no lung-specific models have been generated. Thus, DPP-4\u2212/- transgenic mice (mice in which the",
            "gene encoding DPP-4 was inactivated) are valuable tools for predicting absence of function; however, pharmacological inhibition only retards enzymes activity, not all aspects of DPP-4 activity, so results from these models must be interpreted with caution."

        "2.3. DPP-4 and the immune response": [
            "DPP-4 can modulate the immune response, particularly with respect to T-cell activation and homeostasis. The immune function of DPP-4/CD26 is a product of its ectopeptidase activity and multiple interactions with other molecules that allows pleiotropic actions such as T-cell activation and modulating chemotaxis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. CD26/DPP-4 may alter the phenotypic pattern of lymphocyte composition and modify their function. In DPP-4\u2212/mice, the numbers of lymphocytes were decreased [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. These animals exhibited different patterns of cytokine production and antibody production, an altered T-cell response to mitogen stimulation, and decreased numbers of peripheral blood Natural Killer (NK) cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. In contrast to murine CD26, human CD26 exerts a costimulatory action both in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Moreover, human CD26 has a binding capactiy to adenosine deaminase (ADA) and plays a role in ADA-related T-cell immunity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. The correlation between T-cell CD26 expression and TH1 type immune responses may involve interleukin(IL)-12-dependent CD26 upregulation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. IL-12 increases CD26 expression on activated T-cells and DPP-4 may drive the TH1 response by chemokine cleavage [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. NK cells also express DPP-4 upon activation; functionally DPP-4/CD26 is thought to support NK cytokine production [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. Therefore, the therapeutic inhibition of DPP-4 for the treatment of diabetes and metabolic syndrome led to some concern about the off-target effects of these treatments, specifically on immune function."

DPP-4/CD26 is a biomarker of migrating lung fibroblasts and of their activation to produce collagen and inflammatory cytokines. DPP-4 inhibition enhances the reversible phase of vascular dysfunction in pulmonary hypertension, attenuates endothelial-tomesenchymal transition and diminishes the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts, preventing fibrosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Thus, this strategy could inhibit the irreversible phase of pulmonary hypertension. Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor attenuated right ventricular systolic pressure and remodeling, hypertrophy of pulmonary arteries, inflammatory cell infiltration, and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in monocrotalineinduced pulmonary hypertension rats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>].

        "2.5. DPP-4 and asthma": [
            "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory system that can cause recurrent bronchial constriction and restrict airflow. The development of asthma is multifactorial and remains in part unknown; however, initiation is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. Peptidases such as DPP-4 are known to contribute to the pathophysiology of numerous diseases including, chronic respiratory conditions, for example, asthma. Those enzymes with preferential catalytic activity for proline residues are rare given that peptide bonds that are juxtaposed to proline are extremely resistant to cleavage [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. These peptide sequences can be found in growth factors and cytokines that play a crucial role in immune dysfunction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Many studies have been conducted to determine any genetic factors which underlie the development of asthma. In this context, Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have highlighted numerous genes that encode proteins associated with the immune response including IL18R, IL13, IL6R, Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ, HLA G, HLA-G, IL1RL1, IL18R, and ADAM33. DPP-4 and a member of its gene family (DPP-10) are also implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>].

The pathogen that causes MERS was determined to be a novel coronavirus (CoV), hence, it is now termed MERSCoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. Individuals who are infected with MERS-CoV develop a severe respiratory illness, become febrile, and exhibit a cough and shortness of breath. In addition, MERS-CoV infection can be fatal. By September 2019, the WHO has been notified of a total of 2468 cases, of which 851 were fatal [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. DPP-4 is expressed on airway epithelial cells. Cellular uptake of CoV is mediated by the MERS-CoV spike protein (S), which is thought to interact with DPP-4 via 14 peptide sequence [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. This 14-mer is highly conserved, evidenced by the fact that mammals with alternate peptide sequences such as ferrets and hamsters do not succumb to MERS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], and conversely those with identical sequence, e.g. camels, marmosets and rhesus macaques, are susceptible. Modeling the interactions between the CoV spike protein and DPP-4 is one of the main thrusts of MERS-CoV vaccination research [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Ohnuma et al identified the domain of DPP-4/CD26 associated with the binding of MERS-CoV using specific clones of anti-CD26 mAbs and one of mAbs nearly completely inhibited virus entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. In another study, Raj et al established that ADA acts as a natural antagonist for MERS-CoV infection by competitively binding to the virus binding site [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]."

        "2.7. DPP-4 and COPD": [
            "COPD is a multifactorial and complex respiratory disease that is characterized by chronically impaired airflow and a heightened inflammatory response within the airways. Comorbidities are frequent in COPD and may significantly affect quality of life, escalation of symptoms, and ultimately the survival [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. The pathology of COPD is yet to be fully elucidated however, a dysregulated chronic immune response is thought to be an important driver [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. DPP-4 modulates the immune response, as previously discussed. Furthermore, the influence of the protease DPP-4 was investigated on tissue remodeling in lung samples obtained from COPD sufferers. Activated alveolar macrophages exhibited strong positive DPP-4 staining. DPP-4 was significantly upregulated in type I and II alveolar epithelial cells. The authors also note a relationship between mesothelial cell hypertrophy and increased DPP-4 staining [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. Remodeling responses in COPD have also revealed a rapid turnover in extracellular matrix protein that is heightened during disease exacerbation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. Proteases such as MMP-1, 2, 3, 9, and 14; elastin and cathepsins are pivotal to the activation state of chemokines. DPP-4/CD26 is also known to act on CXCL12 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. It is possible, therefore, that active proteases activity might act either directly or via chemokine regulation to exacerbate tissue degradation in COPD.",
            "under investigation. It seems that DPP-4 expression and activity exhibit a wide variation depending on tumor locality and tissue-type [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. Interestingly, DPP-4 can act either as a tumor activator or suppressor depending on paracrine signals, the microenvironment, and molecular interactions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. The pharmacological inhibition of DPP-4 in lung cancer patients showed improved overall survival, which was attributed to the effect of DPP-4 inhibition on tumor immunoregulation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>]. Information on the role of DPP-4/CD26 in tumor biology can be inferred from either transgenic animals that lack DPP-4 or its pharmacological inhibition. Moreover, studies that assessed the depletion or absence of DDP4 have been conducted in cervical cancer [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>], colorectal cancer (CRC) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>], melanoma [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>], and lung tumor models [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>] .",

DPP-4/CD26 has been shown to have a pivotal role in both tumor cell metastasis and invasion [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]. There are a variety of suggested mechanisms for DPP-4 to impinge on cancer metastasis. DPP-4 has intrinsic ectopeptidase activity and modulates chemokines, which can mobilize cancer cells. Tumor immune surveillance may be also influenced by DPP4, given that it has catalytic activity, with respect to both CXCL10 and CXCL12 that would otherwise assist in lymphocyte migration [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>]. Moreover, DPP-4 is known to bind matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are proteinases that permit cell migration by removing abundant structural proteins such as collagens, laminins, and proteoglycans, thereby allowing the mobilization of cancer cells through solid tissues [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. Fibroblast activation factor-alpha (FAP) is closely related to DPP-4, which has peptidase activity, and is associated with poor outcomes and mortality in patients with lung cancer [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. In addition, DPP-4 is upregulated by the oxygen-sensing transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). This relationship may be a crucial pivot in oxygen-deprived tumors. The inhibition of HIF-1 alpha is a cancer therapy target, as it is a robust initiator of angiogenesis. The interplay between DPP-4 and HIF1-alpha could contribute to antiangiogenic drug resistance and these compounds are regularly used in cancer therapy. DPP-4 inhibition has also been shown to protect against hypoxia-induced cytotoxicity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>]."

            "The role(s) CD26/DPP-4 in the natural history of tumor biology (as a whole) are debated. Numerous early-stage clinical trials have failed to draw comprehensive conclusions. This may be because the actions of DPP-4 are specific to the type of tumor",
            "CD26/DPP-4 is expressed in numerous cell types and is involved in multiple pathways such as apoptosis, signal transduction, glucose metabolism and immune modulation. Its overexpression also correlates with a range of diseases, making it an attractive therapeutic target. However, its pleiotropic effects also render it difficult to be employed as an effective long-term treatment with limited side effects. Indeed, in 2006, the FDA approved sitagliptin, the first of a class of oral hypoglycemics that block DPP-4 to treat type 2 diabetes. However, in 2015 and 2016, the FDA issued two warnings and precautions on their use for adverse effects on joint pains [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>] and heart failures [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>].",
            "Although long-standing efforts have been placed in using DPP-4 inhibitors for metabolic disorders, they have only recently emerged as novel therapeutic targets in asthma therapy, given the enzymatic activity of DPP-4, alongside the recruitment of CD26/DPP-4 positive T-cells, which are elevated during airway inflammation. In DPP-4 knockout mouse models of airway inflammation, the absence of DPP-4 is protective when compared to wild-type mice.",
            "Another important frontier in this field is exploring localized and targeted inhibition of the enzyme as opposed to a global approach. Due to the pleiotropic functions of DPP-4, it is no surprise that systemic and long-term inhibition leads to numerous severe side effects, but a more controlled modulation of the enzyme could hold the key to opening new therapeutic possibilities. Indeed, Stephan et al have shown that continuous systemic inhibition of DPP-4 mediated by oral administration exacerbates airway inflammation in an experimental model of asthma. Conversely, topical inhibition was effective and given its potential impact on this prevalent and significant respiratory disease, further research in humans is merited [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>].",
            "A novel strategy to target DPP-4 action is to explore the interactome of this enzyme and to target its interacting domains. As previously mentioned, the S protein of MERSCoV interacts with a 14-mer found in DPP-4 and animals lacking this are resistant to the disease. To date, no vaccines with regulatory approval or any therapy exists to combat MERS-CoV, a potentially lethal viral respiratory disease. The S protein of MERS-CoV has a pivotal role in cellular viral uptake and therefore represents an optimal target for vaccine and antiviral development. Indeed, the 14-mer peptide is being modeled to further MERS-CoV vaccine research. DNA vaccines that express the S protein, and would, therefore, mark any cells expressing S protein via surface MHC for destruction also warrant development [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>].",
            "In recent years, there has also been an interest and advances in biopharmaceutical drugs and DPP-4 has been shown to be an interesting target for this type of treatments. A novel anti-DPP-4/ CD26 humanized monoclonal antibody YS110 has been developed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>], and is currently in phase-1 trials to determine dose, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity. Furthermore, CD26/ DPP-4 is overexpressed in the lung tumor, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), and in several human malignancies such as chronic myeloid leukemia and gastric adenocarcinoma. CD26/ DPP-4 expression is also reported to be expressed by cancer stem cells. Given the potential roles of DPP-4, YS110 therapy might be used to limit tumor growth by exerting its effect on the cancer stem cells of these tumors. DPP-4 inhibition in patients with colon cancer decreased the growth of lung metastases by decreasing autophagy, increasing apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle. It is possible that anti-DPP- 4 monoclonal antibodies could be advanced to treat a number of respiratory disorders.",
            "Small interfering RNA (siRNA), are also commonly referred to as short interfering RNA or silencing RNA. siRNA is a type of double-stranded, non-coding RNA molecule similar to micro",
            "RNA (miRNA), that operates within the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. They are designed to impede the expression of targeted genes with complementary nucleotide sequences, by degrading mRNA after transcription, and thus inhibiting translation. Jean et al are developing novel delivery vehicles to transfer siRNA specific to DPP-4. Moreover, positively charged nucleic acids are challenging to deliver across the cell membrane, and the therapeutic nucleic acids are vulnerable to nucleases. Novel chitosan (CS)-based nanoparticles (NP) were developed to help deliver siRNA to target cells. RT-PCR assays confirmed reduced expression the DPP-4 gene in treated cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. Recent advances in research have shown the potential that DPP-4 holds in treatment of diseases, not least respiratory ones. Furthermore, its biological functions beyond metabolic disorders are slowly emerging and the molecular pathways, interactions and associations are being understood. This paves the way to innovative anti-DPP-4 therapies which are being developed and furthers its use as a drug target. It can be used in a wide spectrum of pharmaceutical approaches and different domains of the protein can be targeted. These strategies also hold the potential to reduce side effects and thus be approved for therapeutic use."

            "Apart from its enzymatic activity as an ectopeptidase, dipeptidylPeptidase-4 (DPP-4)/CD26 has pleiotropic effects; it is known to modulate the immune system notably T-cell homeostasis, impact tumor biology, and affect the activity of several important biomedical proteins such as chemokines.",
            "It may play a critical role in numerous diseases, including those of the respiratory system.",
            "The need for novel approaches to biomedical research and treatments is paramount"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "DPP-4 clearly has a deleterious role in respiratory disease such as asthma and lung cancer.",
            "Further exploring the role of this multifaceted molecule in lung disease may yield vital and novel therapies.",
            "DPP-4 and lung cancer.",
            "The role(s) CD26/DPP-4 in the natural history of tumor biology are debated.",
            "Numerous early-stage clinical trials have failed to draw comprehensive conclusions.",
            "This may be because the actions of DPP-4 are specific to the type of tumor"
