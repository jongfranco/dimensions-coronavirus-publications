        "abstract": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is an alphacoronavirus that causes a nearly 100% mortality rate without effective treatment. Here we report a 3.3-\u00c5 cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the serotype I FIPV spike (S) protein, which is responsible for host recognition and viral entry. Mass spectrometry provided site-specific compositions of densely distributed high-mannose and complex-type N-glycans that account for 1/4 of the total molecular mass; most of the N-glycans could be visualized by cryo-EM. Specifically, the N-glycans that wedge between 2 galectin-like domains within the S1 subunit of FIPV S protein result in a unique propeller-like conformation, underscoring the importance of glycosylation in maintaining protein structures. The cleavage site within the S2 subunit responsible for activation also showed distinct structural features and glycosylation. These structural insights provide a blueprint for a better molecular understanding of the pathogenesis of FIP.",

            "In summary, we describe, at the atomic level, the structure and glycosylation of FIPV-UU4 S protein. This represents structural work on the serotype I FIPV family, which inflicts an exceptionally high mortality rate for infected cats. The structure reveals major structural differences in the S1 subunit from the only known example within the alphacoronavirus genera, HCoV-NL63 S protein, for which structural information is available. These results demonstrate how structurally divergent these S proteins can be despite their sequence homology (SI Appendix, Table S1). The integrated use of cryo-EM and MS reveals the unique domain architecture with detailed structural information regarding its glycosylation, the galectin-like N-terminal domains, and the location of the putative RBMs of serotype I FIPV. The high-resolution structure of FIPV-UU4 S protein may therefore serve as the blueprint for further mechanistic insights into viral host interactions of FIPV."

            "Structure of FIPV-UU4 S Protein.<br/><br/>The ectodomain of FIPV-UU4 S protein was fused with a trimerization domain of T4 fibritin followed by a V5 tag and a His6 tag at the C terminus to replace the transmembrane helix. The recombinant FIPV-UU4 S protein was overexpressed in a human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell line. With 1,391 amino acids in its sequence, the expected molecular mass of the homotrimeric recombinant protein is 465 kDa. Nevertheless, size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle static light scattering (SEC-MALS) indicated an apparent molecular mass of 722 kDa for the single elution peak, of which 192 kDa (27% of the total molecular mass) was ascribed to glycan moieties (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The extensive glycosylation and the trimeric state were confirmed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing and native conditions, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). Importantly, immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrated that mouse anti\u2013FIPV-UU4 S protein serum was able to differentiate serotype I- and II-infected cells, thus establishing the potential of FIPV-UU4 S protein as a potent vaccine candidate for FIP treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C and D). Using a 200-keV electron microscope, we determined the 3D electron density map of the FIPV-UU4 S protein to 3.3-\u00c5 resolution, which revealed a propeller-like homotrimer structure with an overall dimension of 180 \u00c5 in diameter and 170 \u00c5 in height (Fig. 1A, Table 1, SI Appendix, Figs. S2A and S3 A and B, and Movie S1). In contrast, all previously reported cryo-EM structures of CoV S proteins have adopted compact ellipsoidal shapes of which the host receptor-recognizing S1 subunits pack against the spring-loaded coiled-coil S2 subunits (SI Appendix, Table S1) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Local resolution analysis indicated that the propeller-like regions of the EM map were less defined compared with that of the core regions, indicative of local dynamics (SI Appendix, Fig. S3E)."

            "We report here a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of FIPV-UU4 S protein with a distinct domain architecture that sets it apart from all previously reported CoV S protein structures (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2). The most significant structural difference is the unique 3-blade propeller-like structure formed by the S1 subunit. The combined efforts of cryo-EM and MS analyses identified and delineated the positions and structures of 33 out of the 37 predicted N-glycosylation sites, accounting for 27% of the total molecular mass. Our results represent the unprecedentedly detailed analysis of the N-linked glycans of a CoV S protein in terms of their chemical compositions and 3D structures, made possible through the use of a mammalian expression system to introduce physiological mammalian glycosylation patterns. The resulting models revealed some spatial partitioning of high-mannose versus complex-type glycans. Several high-mannose-type glycans are located at the junctions between domains and appear to serve as wedges to maintain the domain architecture (Fig. 2B). It is plausible that the protein domain junctions generate significant steric hindrance, thereby preventing subsequent trimming and addition of the complex-type glycan structures [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]."

            "First reported 4 decades ago, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is one of the most fatal infectious diseases in cats, particularly kittens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. The disease results from infection by a feline CoV (FCoV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].

FCoV can be serologically categorized into 2 types: serotypes I and II. Serotype I FCoV is the most epidemiologically prevalent, contributing to more than 70% of circulating virus isolates worldwide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Progress in FIP research has been limited not least because of difficulties in isolating and propagating serotype I FCoV in vitro for mechanistic studies on pathogenesis at the molecular level, which are urgently needed for the development of vaccines and therapeutics [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "CoVs use their spike (S) proteins for host recognition and subsequent membrane fusion to introduce their viral genomes into the host for replication. Preventing CoV infection by blocking S-protein binding to host receptors therefore represents the first line of defense. CoV S proteins consist of 2 functional units, the S1 and S2 subunits, which are responsible for cell attachment and membrane fusion, respectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Mutations in the receptor-binding motifs (RBMs) or cleavage sites of CoV S proteins can lead to zoonotic spillover and alteration of cell/tissue tropism, as exemplified by SARS and MERS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>].",
            "To better understand the molecular basis of FIPV, we constructed a trimeric S glycoprotein of a serotype I FIPV UU4 strain and overexpressed it in a mammalian cell line, as opposed to insect cell lines that were used in previous structural studies on CoV S proteins [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. This ensured a better resemblance of the posttranslationally modified glycosylation patterns on the S protein, the chemical structures of which were determined by mass spectroscopy (MS). Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle reconstruction was employed to determine the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of FIPV-UU4 S protein to a resolution of 3.3 \u00c5, enabling ab initio model building of not only the protein but also most of the N-glycan structures. The result enabled direct visualization of the camouflaging N-glycans on the surface of FIPV-UU4 S protein. Nearly 1/3 of the observed N-linked glycans correspond to the complex type, which has not been studied in such detail in previously reported CoV S proteins [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].

            "Structure of FIPV-UU4 S Protein.",
            "The ectodomain of FIPV-UU4 S protein was fused with a trimerization domain of T4 fibritin followed by a V5 tag and a His6 tag at the C terminus to replace the transmembrane helix. The recombinant FIPV-UU4 S protein was overexpressed in a human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell line. With 1,391 amino acids in its sequence, the expected molecular mass of the homotrimeric recombinant protein is 465 kDa. Nevertheless, size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle static light scattering (SEC-MALS) indicated an apparent molecular mass of 722 kDa for the single elution peak, of which 192 kDa (27% of the total molecular mass) was ascribed to glycan moieties (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The extensive glycosylation and the trimeric state were confirmed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing and native conditions, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). Importantly, immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrated that mouse anti\u2013FIPV-UU4 S protein serum was able to differentiate serotype I- and II-infected cells, thus establishing the potential of FIPV-UU4 S protein as a potent vaccine candidate for FIP treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C and D). Using a 200-keV electron microscope, we determined the 3D electron density map of the FIPV-UU4 S protein to 3.3-\u00c5 resolution, which revealed a propeller-like homotrimer structure with an overall dimension of 180 \u00c5 in diameter and 170 \u00c5 in height (Fig. 1A, Table 1, SI Appendix, Figs. S2A and S3 A and B, and Movie S1). In contrast, all previously reported cryo-EM structures of CoV S proteins have adopted compact ellipsoidal shapes of which the host receptor-recognizing S1 subunits pack against the spring-loaded coiled-coil S2 subunits (SI Appendix, Table S1) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Local resolution analysis indicated that the propeller-like regions of the EM map were less defined compared with that of the core regions, indicative of local dynamics (SI Appendix, Fig. S3E).",
            "The high-resolution EM map enabled ab initio model building and refinement to generate an atomic model of FIPV-UU4 S protein. The 3 monomers are intertwined through extensive interactions between the conserved S2 subunits, while the 3 S1 subunits form the propeller blades (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Detailed inspection of the EM map showed well-defined side-chain densities in most regions, including the interstrand disulfide bonds, attesting to the high quality of our EM-derived structural model (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D and Movie S2). After considering the electron densities of individual amino acids, many electron densities remained unaccounted for. It transpired that these additional densities correspond to the N-glycan structures (vide infra). Based on our cryo-EM structure, we defined 5 distinct domains within the S1 subunit: domain 0 (residues 1 to 275), domain A (residues 276 to 540), domain B (residues 541 to 695), domain C (residues 696 to 754), and domain D (residues 755 to 791). The S2 subunit consists of an S2\u2032 cleavage site (residues 969 to 978), a fusion peptide (residues 979 to 1055), and 2 heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2), corresponding to residues 1056 to 1156 and 1342 to 1403, respectively. The electron density map corresponding to the HR2 domain of the C terminus (residues 1338 to 1391) could not be resolved, suggesting conformational heterogeneity that leads to loss of contrast after averaging over a large number of particle images (Fig. 1C). Likewise, the model of the 4 loop segments (residues 1 to 61, 391 to 410, 781 to 796, and 1337 to 1361) could not be built because of the loss of the corresponding EM maps, potentially due to intrinsic dynamics.",
            "Site-Specific N-Glycosylation Mapped by MS and Cryo-EM.",
            "Glycosylation of CoV S proteins is implicated in protein folding [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], structure stability [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], virus entry, and receptor recognition [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. According to the sequence, 37 N-linked glycosylation sites are predicted for FIPV-UU4 S protein. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the de\u2013N-glycosylated tryptic peptides led to identification of 29 occupied N-glycosites based on the conversion of Asn to Asp upon PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2A). The remaining 8 predicted N-glycosylation sites, namely 27NTSH, 31NNSK, 482NYTD, 585NGSV, and 590NVTS in the S1 subunit, 1308NTTH in the S2 subunit, and 1352NQTK and 1357NLTA in HR2, were not verified due to the lack of corresponding tryptic peptides. To obtain an unbiased view of the range of N-glycans carried, the pool of released N-glycans was profiled by MALDI-MS after permethylation. Both high-mannose and \u00b1core-fucosylated, \u00b1sialylated complex-type N-glycans were evidently present, with Man9GlcNAc2 (M9) and a simple core-fucosylated biantennary structure contributing to the 2 most intense molecular ion signals detected (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Taking the average size of these 2 predominant N-glycan structures\u20141,768 Da for biantennary and 1,864 Da for M9\u2014that were released from the FIPV-UU4 S protein, a total of 37 glycosylated sites would contribute to a total of 66.6 kDa of glycan per monomer, namely ca. 200 kDa for a trimer, consistent with the 192-kDa glycan contribution as inferred from SEC-MALS data (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). Collectively, it confirms that FIPV-UU4 S protein is indeed heavily N-glycosylated at most, if not all, of the predicted sites.",
            "Structural analysis of N-glycosylation of FIPV-UU4 S protein by mass spectrometry and cryo-EM. (A) Site-specific annotation of glycan structures. The positions of individual N-glycosylation sites are indicated by their residue numbers along the primary sequence of FIPV-UU4 S protein, which is colored using the same scheme as in Fig. 1D. Glycan structures that were confirmed by glycopeptide analysis with high confidence are shown schematically with the individual symbols defined (Right). Some glycosylation sites exhibit heterogeneous glycan structures, which are stacked onto each other at the same site. Protein sequences that were not covered by tryptic digests are shown in white. Positions that are predicted to be N-glycosylated but were not experimentally verified are indicated by dashed lines. (B) Spatial distributions of experimentally identified glycosylation patterns on FIPV-UU4 S protein shown in 2 orthogonal views as a homotrimer. Mass spectrometry-identified high-mannose and complex/mixed-type glycans are colored in green and magenta, respectively. N-glycosylation that was observed by cryo-EM but not by mass spectrometry are shown in basic type and colored in pale yellow. GlyProt was used to generate the most common atomic structures of high-mannose and complex-type glycans in order to illustrate the extent of the most probable glycan distributions over the surface of the FIPV-UU4 S protein. (C and E) Overlaid extracted ion chromatograms (Left) for the major glycoforms identified on N1218 (C) and N949 (E) are shown along with the HCD MS/MS spectra of the doubly charged glycopeptides (Right), corresponding to the most abundant glycoforms. The accurately measured m/z of peptide b and y ions with and without carrying the single HexNAc at the Asn, together with the Y0 (peptide backbone) and Y1 (peptide backbone + HexNAc), allowed unambiguous assignment of the nontryptic glycopeptides. The glycan compositions were inferred from molecular masses alone and annotated using the standard Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans as high-mannose (Man9GlcNAc2) and core-fucosylated biantennary complex-type N-glycans, respectively. Annotation of the fragment ions: F, fucose; H, hexose; N, N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc). (D and F) Expanded views of cryo-EM maps corresponding to the high-mannose structure on N1218 (D) and complex-type structure on N949 (F). Note that a clear protrusion next to the stem HexNAc was observed, which was assigned to be core fucosylation, in line with the mass spectrometry data (E). Both D and F were derived from the 3.3-\u00c5 map (DPC dataset).",
            "The extensive N-glycosylation of FIPV-UU4 S protein was evident in the 2-dimensional classifications of the raw cryo-EM particle images. The use of the Volta phase plate (VPP) in combination with a 300-keV electron microscope enhanced the contrast of the blurry density around the core protein densities. The VPP-derived dataset was used to construct a 3D EM map, which showed better-defined protrusions with lower local resolutions as a result of conformational heterogeneity (SI Appendix, Figs. S2B and S5). Through different image-processing procedures, we could unambiguously build 28 N-linked glycan structures onto the atomic model, including 2 N-glycosylation sites, N585 and N590, which were not identified by LC-MS/MS analysis of the de\u2013N-glycosylated peptides (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). The reconstituted glycan EM densities were mostly limited to 1 or 2 N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties linked to the asparagine side chains due to their intrinsic dynamics. Nonetheless, a number of well-defined glycan densities could be traced and modeled with up to 7 monosaccharide residues. In the case of N357 and N1218, we could resolve the densities that correspond to 2 GlcNAcs and up to 5 mannoses, which is indicative of these 2 sites being mostly glycosylated by high-mannose-type structures (Fig. 2 D and F and Movie S3).",
            "To further define the distribution of high-mannose versus complex-type N-glycans over the various sites, tryptic digests of FIPV-UU4 S protein were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis without first removal of the N-glycans. By directly identifying the intact glycopeptides, the site-specific N-glycosylation pattern of 24 sites could be profiled, including 482NYTD and 1308NTTH, not detected by previous analysis of de\u2013N-glycosylated peptides. This brings the total of MS-verified N-glycosylation to 31 out of the predicted 37 sites (summarized in Fig. 2A). For each of the identified sites, the most abundant and hence most representative glycoforms were deduced from the relative peak intensities of the manually extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of the corresponding glycopeptides (SI Appendix, Table S2). For example, the XICs of glycopeptides derived from N1218 and N949 indicated that the major glycoforms correspond to an M9 high mannose and a nonsialylated, fucosylated biantennary complex-type glycan structure, respectively (Fig. 2 C and E, Left). Close examination of the EM density protruding from the side chain of N949 revealed additional density next to the first GlcNAc moiety linked to N949. We attributed this to a core fucose (Fuc), which is consistent with and fully corroborated by the corresponding glycopeptide MS/MS spectrum, which contained a diagnostic peptide backbone fragment ion carrying a GlcNAc and a Fuc (Y1+F; Fig. 2E).",
            "Combining all our cryo-EM and MS data, 33 out of the 37 predicted N-linked glycosylated sites were identified, including 18 and 15 sites in the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively (SI Appendix, Table S3). The 4 unaccounted sites included N27 and N31 at the N terminus and N1352 and N1357 at the C terminus, all of which were not resolved by cryo-EM. Based on the chemical structures of the most populated N-glycans derived from glycopeptide analysis and the complementary cryo-EM results, we generated an atomic model that represented the most likely spatial distribution of the N-glycans on the FIPV-UU4 S protein (Figs. 2B and 3 and SI Appendix, Table S3). These glycans shield more than 2/3 of the protein surface, potentially camouflaging protein functional motifs to evade detection by the host immune system.",

Such a pronounced conformational difference could stem from the extensive glycosylation at N254, N357, and N491 that wedge between domains 0 and A (Fig. 3A). Domain 0 is only present in alphacoronaviruses, while it is structurally similar to domain A of other CoV genera (SI Appendix, Table S4). Structure-based bioinformatics analysis indicated that both domains 0 and A of FIPV-UU4 S protein are structurally homologous to galectins, and galectin-4 in particular (SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5). Nevertheless, domains 0 and A of FIPV-UU4 S protein have distinct glycosylation patterns, leading to differential steric hindrance and physiochemical characteristics on their surfaces that may influence host recognition (Figs. 2A and 3A and SI Appendix, Tables S2 and S3).",

Furthermore, the putative carbohydrate-binding pocket in domain 0 is sequestered by a long loop in the cryo-EM structure.

            "Because hemagglutinin activity has been reported for several CoVs, we asked whether individual domains of FIPV-UU4 S protein indeed exhibit lectin activity as a way to bind to host cell-surface glycans for mediating FIPV infection. We employed an array of 100 glycan structures to test the lectin activities of full-length FIPV-UU4 S protein and 3 truncated variants, namely domain 0 only, domains 0 and A, and domains 0, A, and B (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods). Three groups of glycan structures were found to be recognized by all 4 variants, namely sialylated or core-Fuc Gal\u03b2(1\u21924)Glc\u03b2-core structures, sialylated Gal\u03b2(1\u21923)GalNAc\u03b2-core structures, and oligo-glucose (Glc) structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Notably, NeuAc sialylation at the 6 position of the inner GalNAc seems to be required (compound 67) while additional sialylation at the 6 position of Gal (compound 69) increased its affinity slightly. However, sialylation at the 6 position of Gal itself without the presence of sialylation on GalNAc (compound 68) did not support binding, whereas the additional presence of sialylation at the 3 position of Gal (compound 70) actually inhibited the binding slightly. Collectively, the glycan array data suggest that positive recognition and binding by domain 0 prefer a minimum Gal\u03b2(1\u21923)GalNAc\u03b2-core structure sialylated at the 6 position of GalNAc. Di- and tri-Glc with \u03b1-linkages could be recognized. The structural basis and functional implications of recognizing these sialylated disaccharides in the context of FIPV host recognition remain to be established.",

The structures of domain B from different CoVs share the same overall \u03b2-sandwich fold structure, encompassing 2 3-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheets with divergent loop sequences and conformations that constitute the putative receptor-binding motifs (Fig. 4C). The RBMs play a key role in host specificity; mutations in them are responsible for interspecies transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Among the 4 selected alphacoronaviruses, FIPV-UU4, HCoV-NL63, human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), FIPV-UU4 S protein has the longest loop 1 in domain B with a distinct helical conformation (Fig. 4 C\u2013E and SI Appendix, Table S6), rendering it more solvent-exposed and potentially more accessible to host receptors than that of HCoV-NL63 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].

        "Discussion": [
            "We report here a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of FIPV-UU4 S protein with a distinct domain architecture that sets it apart from all previously reported CoV S protein structures (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2). The most significant structural difference is the unique 3-blade propeller-like structure formed by the S1 subunit. The combined efforts of cryo-EM and MS analyses identified and delineated the positions and structures of 33 out of the 37 predicted N-glycosylation sites, accounting for 27% of the total molecular mass. Our results represent the unprecedentedly detailed analysis of the N-linked glycans of a CoV S protein in terms of their chemical compositions and 3D structures, made possible through the use of a mammalian expression system to introduce physiological mammalian glycosylation patterns. The resulting models revealed some spatial partitioning of high-mannose versus complex-type glycans. Several high-mannose-type glycans are located at the junctions between domains and appear to serve as wedges to maintain the domain architecture (Fig. 2B). It is plausible that the protein domain junctions generate significant steric hindrance, thereby preventing subsequent trimming and addition of the complex-type glycan structures [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>].",
            "In addition to protein folding, viral protein glycosylation plays a pivotal role in viral infection. Glycosylation of virus envelope proteins helps shield their antibody-neutralizing epitopes as a way to evade host immunity. One of the best-known examples is the envelope glycoprotein (gp120) of HIV-1, of which glycosylation accounts for almost half of its molecular mass and plays an essential role in host immunity evasion [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. In CoVs, a recent study on HCoV-NL63 suggests that the glycosylation at N358 within its RBMs may serve as molecular trickery for evading host immunity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. However, the role of the absent glycan shield at the corresponding putative RBMs in FIPV-UU4 S protein should be further investigated.",
            "In addition to their protective roles in shielding viruses from being neutralized by host immune systems, spike-protein glycosylation can be selectively recognized by host cells to facilitate viral infections. Lectin-dependent enhancements of viral infections have been reported for SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>], Ebola virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>], Marburg virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>], and Dengue virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. Both serotype I and serotype II FIPVs use feline dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (fDC-SIGN) as a coreceptor to recognize high-mannose glycans during viral entry and transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. Domain A of FIPV-UU4 S protein is densely decorated with high-mannose-type glycans, which could be implicated in interacting with fDC-SIGN during viral infection (Figs. 2A and 3A).",
            "While viral envelope or S-protein glycosylation is targeted by host cells, several viral envelope or S proteins also exhibit lectin activities to recognize host surface glycans in trans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. For example, a number of CoVs have been reported to exhibit hemagglutinin activity with some preference for sialylated oligosaccharides [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. Through glycan array analysis, we obtained experimental evidence of lectin activity for domain 0 of FIPV-UU4 S protein, which showed a distinct binding preference for a Gal\u03b2(1\u21923)GalNAc\u03b2-core structure sialylated at the 6 position of the inner GalNAc. If one disregards the anomericity of the GalNAc, this minimal NeuAc\u03b1(2\u21926)GalNAc\u03b1-determinant corresponds to the sialyl Tn epitope widely implicated as a cancer and CART antigen, and also being developed as a vaccine candidate. Follow-up binding studies including the use of custom-made O-glycans containing the actual sialyl Tn epitope and other core 1 O-glycans sialylated at different positions would be required to substantiate this intriguing finding that sialylated O-glycans on host cell surfaces might play an important role in viral recognition and infection of serotype I FIPV.",
            "In the present study, 33 N-glycosylation sites were confirmed on the ectodomain of the trimeric S protein. M9 high mannoses were identified on N1092 and N1218 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8) of the Th1 and/or Th2 epitopes (residues 1051 to 1110 and 1208 to 1235) of the FIPV-UU4 S protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. Viral protein glycosylation might determine the host tropism [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>], immunogenicity, and pathogenicity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>]. The N-linked glycans in Th1 epitopes might function as hindering structures that constrict T cell recognition or mislead the host immune defense by producing an ineffective immune response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>], as demonstrated in HIV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. The role of these glycans in the pathogenesis of FIP should be further studied.",
            "In summary, we describe, at the atomic level, the structure and glycosylation of FIPV-UU4 S protein. This represents structural work on the serotype I FIPV family, which inflicts an exceptionally high mortality rate for infected cats. The structure reveals major structural differences in the S1 subunit from the only known example within the alphacoronavirus genera, HCoV-NL63 S protein, for which structural information is available. These results demonstrate how structurally divergent these S proteins can be despite their sequence homology (SI Appendix, Table S1). The integrated use of cryo-EM and MS reveals the unique domain architecture with detailed structural information regarding its glycosylation, the galectin-like N-terminal domains, and the location of the putative RBMs of serotype I FIPV. The high-resolution structure of FIPV-UU4 S protein may therefore serve as the blueprint for further mechanistic insights into viral host interactions of FIPV.",

            "Using a 200-keV electron microscope, the authors determined the 3D electron density map of the FIPV-UU4 S protein to 3.3-\u00c5 resolution, which revealed a propeller-like homotrimer structure with an overall dimension of 180 \u00c5 in diameter and 170 \u00c5 in height (Fig. 1A, Table 1, SI Appendix, Figs.",
