            "To prepare for this emerging infectious disease, fever screening has been set up at the airport and high-speed rail station, focusing particularly on flights and trains from Wuhan. Travellers with fever 38oC are referred to public hospitals for assessment. In the public hospital system, the key measures include a surveillance system to identify suspected cases for early isolation in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). Standard, contact, droplet and airborne precautions are implemented during patient care practices for the suspected cases, before the mode of transmission is known. The surveillance definition comprises clinical criteria (any patient with fever and acute respiratory illness, or pneumonia) plus a travel history to Wuhan in the 14 days before onset of symptoms, irrespective of any wet market exposure. For the purpose of surveillance, triage stations have been set up in the accident and emergency departments (AEDs) and outpatient clinics, where personal protective equipment (PPE) includes surgical mask, face shield or equivalent, and gown as minimum. Patients fulfilling the clinical and epidemiological criteria are isolated immediately in an AIIR for further assessment. Faceto-face right-on-time education has been provided for frontline healthcare workers in the AEDs, acute medical wards, isolation wards, intensive care units, general wards, ambulatory day centres, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and pharmacy. In addition, open staff forums were provided during the first week of preparedness in the hospitals. During the training sessions, staff were reminded to be alert to the identification of suspected cases, and to use infection control measures by wearing an N95 respirator, face shield or equivalent, gloves and gown when performing aerosol-generating procedures on all patients in both AIIRs and general wards, in case suspected patients had been missed by the surveillance system. In addition, the opportunity was taken to remind staff of the administrative support of the hospital preparedness plan for emerging infectious diseases, including waste and linen management, environmental cleaning and supply of PPE."

            "Before identification of the aetiological agent, the diagnostic strategy includes a two-tier approach. The first tier is to screen the upper respiratory specimen (nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasopharyngeal flocked swab) by Biofire (FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2), which is a molecular diagnostic test to detect 17 respiratory viruses and four bacteria in 1 h. The second tier is to investigate the FilmArray RP2-negative specimen for pan-CoV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [8] with modification in order to detect 23 CoVs known to be present in humans, animals and bats within 24 h. Pan-CoV PCRnegative specimens would be further investigated by performing Nanopore sequencing to identify the novel agent.
