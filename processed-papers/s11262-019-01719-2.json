        "abstract": "Bats are carriers of potentially zoonotic viruses, therefore it is crucial to identify viruses currently found in bats to better understand how they are maintained in bat populations and evaluate risks for transmission to other species. Adenoviruses have been previously detected in bats throughout the world, but sampling is still limited. In this study, 30 pooled-guano samples were collected from a cave roost of Myotis velifer in Oklahoma. A portion of the DNA polymerase gene from Adenoviridae was amplified successfully in 18 M. velifer samples; however, DNA sequence was obtained from only 6 of these M. velifer samples. One was collected in October 2016, one in March 2017, and 4 in July 2017. The October and March samples contained viral DNA that was 3.1% different from each other but 33% different than the novel viral sequence found in the July 2017 samples. Phylogenetic analysis of these fragments confirmed our isolates were from the genus Mastadenovirus and had genetic diversity ranging from 20 to 50% when compared to other bat adenoviruses.",

            "Bats make up 20% of all mammals, and they are the second richest mammalian order in respect to number of species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. In recent years, bats have emerged as a rich source of novel viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. They have been found to host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], and even documented to harbor viruses from two different viral families simultaneously [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Viruses in bats can switch hosts to other bat species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] and they are known to carry pathogenic viruses that can infect humans such as rabies, lyssaviruses, nipah and hendra viruses, ebola, and SARS coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. However, in most cases bats serve as reservoirs for viruses with immunological tolerance and without transmission to other humans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Consequently, it is important to first identify viruses housed in bats in order to better understand the ecology of bat-borne viruses, how they are maintained in bat populations, and then evaluate risks for host transmission to other species.",
            "Adenoviruses (AdVs) are double stranded DNA viruses found in vertebrate hosts of many different species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The family Adenoviridae consists of five genera [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] with members in the genus Mastadenovirus infecting mammals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. AdVs are widespread in the human population and cause a variety of usually minor symptoms, such as respiratory illnesses, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Generally, these viruses are host-specific [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] and thought to have low zoonotic risk [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]; however, Chen et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] discovered a novel adenovirus (TMAdV) with the ability to infect both monkeys and humans. Since bats are known reservoirs of numerous viruses and cross-species transmission has been documented for an AdV, it will be useful to know which AdVs bats carry. AdV strains have been found in more than 45 species of bats across their global distribution [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] with seven species proposed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. These studies represent a start at investigating bat AdVs, but there is a need for additional studies considering there are over 1300 species of bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and few North American bats have been investigated."

        "SHORT REPORT": [
            "Abstract Bats are carriers of potentially zoonotic viruses, therefore it is crucial to identify viruses currently found in bats to better understand how they are maintained in bat populations and evaluate risks for transmission to other species. Adenoviruses have been previously detected in bats throughout the world, but sampling is still limited. In this study, 30 pooled-guano samples were collected from a cave roost of Myotis velifer in Oklahoma. A portion of the DNA polymerase gene from Adenoviridae was amplified successfully in 18 M. velifer samples; however, DNA sequence was obtained from only 6 of these M. velifer samples. One was collected in October 2016, one in March 2017, and 4 in July 2017. The October and March samples contained viral DNA that was 3.1% different from each other but 33% different than the novel viral sequence found in the July 2017 samples. Phylogenetic analysis of these fragments confirmed our isolates were from the genus Mastadenovirus and had genetic diversity ranging from 20 to 50% when compared to other bat adenoviruses.",

Viruses in bats can switch hosts to other bat species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] and they are known to carry pathogenic viruses that can infect humans such as rabies, lyssaviruses, nipah and hendra viruses, ebola, and SARS coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. However, in most cases bats serve as reservoirs for viruses with immunological tolerance and without transmission to other humans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Consequently, it is important to first identify viruses housed in bats in order to better understand the ecology of bat-borne viruses, how they are maintained in bat populations, and then evaluate risks for host transmission to other species.",

            "Adenoviruses (AdVs) are double stranded DNA viruses found in vertebrate hosts of many different species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The family Adenoviridae consists of five genera [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] with members in the genus Mastadenovirus infecting mammals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. AdVs are widespread in the human population and cause a variety of usually minor symptoms, such as respiratory illnesses, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Generally, these viruses are host-specific [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] and thought to have low zoonotic risk [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]; however, Chen et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] discovered a novel adenovirus (TMAdV) with the ability to infect both monkeys and humans. Since bats are known reservoirs of numerous viruses and cross-species transmission has been documented for an AdV, it will be useful to know which AdVs bats carry. AdV strains have been found in more than 45 species of bats across their global distribution [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] with seven species proposed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. These studies represent a start at investigating bat AdVs, but there is a need for additional studies considering there are over 1300 species of bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and few North American bats have been investigated.",
            "In this study, Myotis velifer guano samples were tested for the presence of AdVs. We expected to find AdVs in M. velifer because that genus had the most AdVs in a study on 19 bat species in China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Guano was collected from M.",
            "Virus Genes (2020) 56:99\u2013103 velifer individuals in Washita Bat Cave (Washita Co, OK). Samples were either collected from a plastic tarp left laying overnight at the entrance of the cave (in March or July) or after bats were captured and placed in a sterile cup for 1 h (in October). Bats were handled following guidelines from Sikes et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>], and white nose syndrome decontamination protocols were followed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>].

Nested PCR of the partial Adenoviridae DNA polymerase gene was carried out on each sample following Li et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] using primers pol-F (5\u2032 CAGCCKCKGTTRTGYAGGGT 3\u2032) and pol-R (5\u2032 GCHACCATYAGCTCCAACTC 3\u2032). Cycling profile consisted of 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 48 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, and then a final extension of 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. The second round of amplification used 1 \u03bcl of first round PCR product as template, primers pol-nf (5\u2032 GGGCTCRTTRGTCCAGCA 3\u2032 and pol-nr (5\u2032 TAYGACATCTGYGGCATGTA 3\u2032) and the same cycling steps. Positive (Human Adenovirus D DNA from American Type Culture Collection) and negative controls were used for each PCR. Positive PCR products were purified with \u00adWizard\u00ae SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System (Promega). Species verification of bats with positive AdV samples was performed using nested PCR with primers SFF_145f (5\u2032 GTHACHGCYCAYGCHTTYGTAATAAT 3\u2032) and SFF_351r (CTCCWGCRTGDGCWAGRTTTCC 3\u2032) from [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] and thermocycler steps consisting of 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, 38 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 60 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, and final extension of 72 \u00b0C for 10 min to amplify a region of the cytochrome c oxidase gene that is highly diagnostic among bats.",
            "Sanger sequencing of positive samples for bat and AdV identification was performed by Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, and fragments were aligned and manually edited in Geneious v. 10.1.3 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. AdV sequences (131) isolated from other bat species, turkey, canine, bovine, and human AdVs A, B, C, and D on GenBank were added to the final alignment.

When all sequences from GenBank were included in the alignment the model of nucleotide evolution was the General Time Reversible model with a gamma distribution of 0.6376 and invariant sites. In this analysis (not shown), the AdV sequences did not form clusters according to their host family. This suggests transmission between host species is more common than coevolution with the host.",
            "Myotis velifer samples from October 2016 (Guano 61) and March 2017 (Guano 2) were only 3.1% different from each other, while they were ~ 33% different from the 4 sequences extracted from July 2017 samples (Guano 21, 22, 24, 25). Guano 21 was identical to Guano 22 and 24, and it was only 1 nucleotide different than Guano 25. DNA sequences from Guano 2, 61, and 21 have been deposited in GenBank (Accession MN240005\u2013MN240007). We do recognize the sequenced fragment is short (241 basepairs) and only provides preliminary viral classification. AdVs species are designated if amino acid sequence is > 5% for the DNA polymerase gene. Based on this criterion, we suggest Guano 61 and Guano 2 are different strains of the same AdV species and are further referred to as Cave Myotis AdV1-1 and Cave Myotis AdV1-2. DNA sequence from Guano sample 21, 22, 24, and 25 represent a separate Adenovirus species and are further referred to as Cave Myotis AdV2. There were 2 non-synonymous mutations and 2 synonymous mutations between Cave Myotis AdV1-1 and AdV1-2. Cave Myotis AdV1-1 and AdV1-2 are most similar to GU226951 isolated from Myotis horsfieldii [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] with genetic differences of 21.7% and 23.3%, respectively, and most different from HQ529709 isolated from Rousettus leschenaultii [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] with genetic differences of 48.45 and 49.2%, respectively. Cave Myotis AdV2 is most similar to MF404977, 80\u201382, 84\u201387 isolated from Pipistrellus pygmaeus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] with a genetic difference of 20.2%. Cave Myotis AdV2 is most different from KC692424, 28 isolated from Pteropus giganteus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] and HQ529709 isolated from R. leschenaultii [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] by 44.5%. These two new AdVs are \u2265 27% different than any currently recognized bat mastadenovirus A\u2013G (Table 1). When AdV sequences were compared to other AdVs from bats, genetic diversity ranged from 20 to 50%. This study demonstrates that there is great genetic diversity of DNA viruses within the same species of bats found in the same location, which is relatively uncommon for other vertebrate viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
