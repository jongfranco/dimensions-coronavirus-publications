            "In the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and was causing a serious outbreak of acute respiratory illness.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Wuhan locates in the centre of mainland China with a population of 14 million and is very conveniently connected to other parts of China through airlines and highspeed rails.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] As of 31 January 2020 (5:00 p.m., GMT + 8), there were 9809 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases in mainland China, including 213 deaths and 180 discharges.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Cases infected in Wuhan were also detected in many foreign countries or regions including Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, the United States, Canada and some European countries.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that the novel coronavirus outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern. Official reports on the newly confirmed cases are released very rapidly (several times a day) after January 16,3\u20135 as the official diagnosis protocol was released by the WHO on January 17.6 Recent studies indicated the likelihood of travel-related risks of 2019-nCoV spreading both domestically and internationally.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Many major cities in mainland China reported the finding of imported cases, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The outbreak is still on-going with an increasing trend in daily new cases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Before the Wuhan lockdown (official travel restriction) on January 23, virtually all cases found in other major cities were exported cases from Wuhan. Population flow data between major cities in mainland China are available online due to the rapid development of internet in recent decades, see https://qianxi.baidu.com/ (in Chinese). In this work, we quantified the association between the domestic travel load and the number of cases exported from Wuhan to other cityclusters in mainland China. Our city-clusters are the pool of top five cities in the top 10 provinces (in number of cumulative cases). Thus, we included 10 city-clusters in the analysis, and the details of the selected city-clusters can be found in Supplementary Data S1.",
            "We examined the association between the load of domestic passengers departed from Wuhan and the number of confirmed cases to the 10 city-clusters (including the three municipalities, Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing). Data sets of the daily numbers of domestic passengers were obtained from the location-based services database of Baidu company from January 1 to 20. We selected the top 10 provincial regions (except Hubei) with the largest cumulative number of cases, which accounts for 68% of all cases reported outside Hubei, before the implementation of the city lockdown, on 23 January 2020. Cases from other provinces are scattered and showed no clear pattern. The daily numbers of passengers from Wuhan to the city-clusters of each province were adopted to measure the load of domestic passengers departed from Wuhan to that cluster. From now on, province means the city-clusters in that province. The daily number of cases time series are obtained via the online outbreak situation reports.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Daily cases for each cluster are scaled from daily province total. The detail is given in Supplementary Data. The association was formulated"
