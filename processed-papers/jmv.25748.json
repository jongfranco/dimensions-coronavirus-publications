COVID\u201019 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID\u201019 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID\u201019 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0\u201024 days. The basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID\u201019 ranges from 2\u20103.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID\u201019. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. 3019 health workers were infected by Feb 12, 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan. Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID\u201019 may differ from SARS or MERS.
