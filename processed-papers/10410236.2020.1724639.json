        "abstract": "While there has been increasing attention to the role of social media during infectious disease outbreaks, relatively little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which social media use affects risk perception and preventive behaviors during such outbreaks. Using data collected during the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea, this study explores the relationships among social media use, risk perception, and preventive behaviors by examining the mediating role of two self-relevant emotions: fear and anger. The findings demonstrate that social media use is positively related to both of these emotions, which are also positively related to the public\u2019s risk perception. The findings also indicate that social media use can significantly increase preventive behaviors via the two self-relevant emotions and the public\u2019s risk perception.",

            "The 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea<br/><br/>Middle East respiratory syndrome is a viral respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus. MERS can cause a fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia, kidney failure, and even death, especially among elderly people. The first case of MERS was identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and the first death was reported in that year (WHO, 2018). MERS was identified in South Korea on May 20, 2015, when it was    S.-H. OH ET AL.<br/><br/>brought by a traveler who had visited the Middle East. During the next two months, the virus spread rapidly among health professionals and patients in health centers where MERS patients were being treated, resulting in 186 confirmed cases, including 38 deaths (Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2016). It was the largest outbreak of MERS outside of Saudi Arabia (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChoe_2015_a\" href=\"#rChoe_2015_a\">Choe, 2015</a>). The outbreak triggered widespread public panic and took a heavy toll on South Korea\u2019s economy."

The data was collected via a leading online survey firm in Korea to ensure the representativeness of the data. The firm provided a panel of nationally representative respondents in South Korea. The panel comprised individuals who indicated willingness to complete the survey. A total of 6,973 individuals from the panel were extracted via quota sampling based on age, gender, and region. A survey link was distributed to all of them, and 667 individuals responded. After excluding participants who provided incomplete data, for instance, people who started the survey but did not finish it, we used a total sample of 400 for the analysis. The average age of the participants was 38.07 (SD = 10.33), and there were 200 female participants and 200 male participants."

The results demonstrated that both of fear (\u03b2 = .60, p < .001) and anger (\u03b2 = .15, p < .01) were positively associated with personal-level risk perception. Thus, the results only supported H2-1."

            "Analyzing data collected during the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea, this study attempts to advance knowledge of how social media shape public risk perception and engagement in preventive behaviors. The findings indicate that social media exposure is related to the two self-relevant emotions, fear and anger, and these emotions mediate the relationships between social media exposure and personal-level risk perception as well as preventive behaviors related to MERS.<br/><br/>In recent years, social media have become an increasingly important information source for risk and crisis communication, particularly during infectious disease outbreaks. Information acquisition and exchange via social media during an infectious disease outbreak can complicate communication about the disease, as emotions can play a significant role in shaping public risk perception or subsequent behaviors. The literature on risk communication has yet to disentangle the dynamics among social media use, affective responses, risk perceptions, and behavioral outcomes. This study explicates the emotional and cognitive mechanisms underlying the process through which exposure to risk information on social media shapes people\u2019s risk perceptions and preventive behaviors."

        "ABSTRACT": [
            "While there has been increasing attention to the role of social media during infectious disease outbreaks, relatively little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which social media use affects risk perception and preventive behaviors during such outbreaks. Using data collected during the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea, this study explores the relationships among social media use, risk perception, and preventive behaviors by examining the mediating role of two self-relevant emotions: fear and anger. The findings demonstrate that social media use is positively related to both of these emotions, which are also positively related to the public\u2019s risk perception. The findings also indicate that social media use can significantly increase preventive behaviors via the two self-relevant emotions and the public\u2019s risk perception.",
            "In recent years, a series of infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika, influenza, and Dengue fever around the world have shed light on the significance of effective communication strategies regarding such diseases (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cParmer_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rParmer_et+al_2016_a\">Parmer et al, 2016</a>). An outbreak of infectious disease is the occurrence of a disease that is not usually anticipated in a particular community, geographical region, or time period (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOh_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rOh_et+al_2015_a\">Oh, Paek, & Hove, 2015</a>). Typically, an emerging infectious disease involves rapid spreading, threatening the health of large numbers of people, and thus requires urgent action to stop the disease at the community level (Wurz, Nurn, & Ekdahl, 2013).

Furthermore, theoretical studies investigating the public\u2019s reactions to infectious disease outbreaks are limited. To fill this gap, this study examines how social media use is related to emotional responses and risk perception, which in turn predict preventive behaviors. Using data collected during the 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, hereafter MERS) in South Korea, the study explores underlying mechanisms by examining the roles of two self-relevant emotions: fear and anger. Specifically, the study investigates three issues: (1) how social media use relates to the two self-relevant emotions, (2) the extent to which the self-relevant emotions predict public risk perception, and (3) how social media use affects preventive behaviors through psychological and cognitive mechanisms."

It was the largest outbreak of MERS outside of Saudi Arabia (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChoe_2015_a\" href=\"#rChoe_2015_a\">Choe, 2015</a>). The outbreak triggered widespread public panic and took a heavy toll on South Korea\u2019s economy.",
            "The South Korean government was heavily criticized for its initial response to the epidemic. The government did not initially reveal the names of the hospitals treating MERS patients, and all subsequent infections occurred in these hospitals. The government was accused of being insufficiently trustworthy in communicating with the public and was denounced as slow and inappropriate in its provision of accurate information about the disease. Because the government withheld necessary information, the public did seek and share MERS-related information primarily via social media (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJang_2019_a\" href=\"#rJang_2019_a\">Jang & Paek, 2019</a>). According to a survey conducted during the outbreak (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKim_2015_b\" href=\"#rKim_2015_b\">Kim & Yang, 2015</a>), 71.5% of respondents reported having obtained MERS-related information primarily via social media.

Therefore, we examine how fear and anger elicited by social media use regarding an infectious disease affect risk perception and preventive behaviors related to the disease.",

For example, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHartmann_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rHartmann_et+al_2014_a\">Hartmann et al (2014</a>) found that as individuals perceived more fear due to environmental threats, they were more likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviors. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLatour_2003_a\" href=\"#rLatour_2003_a\">LaTour and Tanner (2003</a>) also showed a positive and liner relationship between fear and preventive behaviors in the context of radioactive radon gas contamination.",
            "The relationship between fear and preventive behaviors can be contingent upon the context in which fear is experienced. The inverted U-shaped Fear Drive Model assumes that a high level of fear can cause fleeing, thereby promoting survival (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAli_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rAli_et+al_2019_a\">Ali et al, 2019</a>). However, a high level of fear can promote preventive behaviors in a situation in which people do have no choice but to take such behaviors for their survivals as it encourages systematic information processing such as considering various factors related to the situation that evokes fear (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTiedens_2001_a\" href=\"#rTiedens_2001_a\">Tiedens & Linton, 2001</a>). <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWon_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rWon_et+al_2015_a\">Won, Bae, and Yoo (2015</a>) reported that specific preventive behavior-related terms (e.g., wearing masks, hand sanitizer, and avoiding crowed places) were the most frequently mentioned words on social media during the MERS outbreak. It might be because such an infectious disease can fatally affect people\u2019s lives unless they engage in preventive behaviors immediately during the outbreak. Therefore, we assume that people are more likely to take precautionary behaviors when they feel greater fear during the MERS outbreak.",

            "In recent years, social media have become an increasingly important information source for risk and crisis communication, particularly during infectious disease outbreaks. Information acquisition and exchange via social media during an infectious disease outbreak can complicate communication about the disease, as emotions can play a significant role in shaping public risk perception or subsequent behaviors. The literature on risk communication has yet to disentangle the dynamics among social media use, affective responses, risk perceptions, and behavioral outcomes. This study explicates the emotional and cognitive mechanisms underlying the process through which exposure to risk information on social media shapes people\u2019s risk perceptions and preventive behaviors.",
            "As we expected, the findings demonstrate that two selfrelevant emotions, fear and anger, mediate the relationship between social media exposure, personal-level risk perception, and preventive behaviors. The findings extend the differentialimpact hypothesis, which suggests that social media exposure during an infectious disease outbreak can elicit intense selfrelevant emotions and, in turn, increase personal-level risk perception and preventive behaviors. Some scholars have suggested that self-relevant emotions mediate the relationship between mass media and risk perception (e.g., <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOh_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rOh_et+al_2015_a\">Oh et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSnyder_1995_a\" href=\"#rSnyder_1995_a\">Snyder & Rouse, 1995</a>). However, the role of self-relevant emotions in social media has not been investigated. By incorporating the roles of self-relevant emotions, this study extends the differential-impact hypothesis on the roles of media genres (e.g., news vs. entertainment) in risk perception beyond traditional media and into the realm of social media.",
            "Guided by the ATF, we assumed that fear would be positively associated with personal-level risk perception, whereas anger would be negatively associated with it. However, the findings of this study demonstrated that both fear and anger were positively associated with personal-level risk perception. The results might stem from the fact that the MERS outbreak was obviously an uncertain and uncontrollable event for the public. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLerner_2001_a\" href=\"#rLerner_2001_a\">Lerner and Keltner (2001</a>) pointed out that the differential appraisal tendencies of fear and anger should emerge most remarkably when a target event is ambiguous regarding controllability and certainty. That is, if an event can be clearly defined in terms of certainty and controllability, individuals\u2019 perceived risks of the event might be subject to the effects of the emotional valence. Some studies also showed the same pattern as ours when the risk events were obviously uncertain and uncontrollable, such as a flood (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGriffin_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rGriffin_et+al_2008_a\">Griffin et al, 2008</a>) or the Ebola outbreak (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_2018_a\" href=\"#rYang_2018_a\">Yang & Chu, 2018</a>). Exploring a broader range of risk issues can advance our understanding of how different self-relevant emotions affect the public\u2019s risk perception and subsequent behaviors.",
            "Although both fear and anger appeared to be positively associated with personal-level risk perception, the association with anger was weaker than that with fear. In the SEM model, although the total effect of anger was significant and positive, it was smaller (\u03b2 = .15, p < .001) than that of fear (\u03b2 = .60, p < .001). In addition, we conducted a post-hoc analysis to demonstrate the role of each emotion in the relationship between social media exposure and preventive behaviors. The findings revealed that the relationship between social media exposure and preventive behaviors was significantly mediated by personal-level risk perception when controlling for anger (indirect effect = .07; CI = .02 to .12) but not for fear (indirect effect = .03; CI = \u2212.01 to .07). When fear is controlled, the relationship between social media exposure and preventive behaviors became insignificant because the influence of fear on personal-level risk perception was controlled. In other words, without the explanatory variance of fear in personal-level risk perception, the relationship between social media exposure and personal-level risk perception was not significant; thus, the mediating effect of personal-level risk perception on the relationship between social media exposure and preventive behavior could not be established. The results indicated that fear fully mediated the relationship between social media exposure and personal-level risk perception. In contrast, when anger was controlled, the mediation effect of personal-level risk perception was still significant, indicating that anger explained personal-level risk perception to a lesser extent than did fear. In other words, even if exposure to MERS-related information on social media did not trigger anger, people tended to believe that the outbreak would affect them. Taken together, our findings support previous literature demonstrating that fear plays a stronger role than anger in shaping risk perception (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLerner_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rLerner_et+al_2003_a\">Lerner et al, 2003</a>).",
            "For future research, in addition to investigating the two self-relevant emotions examined in this study, it will be worthwhile to examine other types of self-relevant emotions that can affect risk perception and behaviors during infectious disease outbreaks. For example, anxiety is associated with the appraisal tendency of facing uncertain existential threats (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLazarus_1991_a\" href=\"#rLazarus_1991_a\">Lazarus, 1991</a>) and accompanies the action tendency of reducing uncertainty (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRaghunathan_1999_a\" href=\"#rRaghunathan_1999_a\">Raghunathan & Pham, 1999</a>). As a highly relevant negative emotion in infectious disease outbreaks, anxiety is one of the emotions people can express prevalently on social media. Although the operationalization of fear often incorporated anxiety (e.g., anxious or worried) in previous studies on fear appeal, fear and anxiety are distinct emotions and, thus, can differentially affect risk perceptions (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSo_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rSo_et+al_2016_a\">So, Kuang, & Cho, 2016</a>). As El-Toukhy (2015) elucidated, susceptibility (the possibility of experiencing a health hazard) and severity (the seriousness of the hazard) are two components of risk perception. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSo_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rSo_et+al_2016_a\">So et al (2016</a>) found that perceived susceptibility was a stronger predictor of anxiety than of fear, whereas perceived severity was a stronger predictor of fear than of anxiety. Furthermore, the scholars demonstrated that anxiety played a stronger role than fear in increasing preventive behavioral intentions related to meningitis. Therefore, an exploration of how other self-relevant emotions such as anxiety influence preventive behaviors would more effectively demonstrate how different emotions can play qualitatively different roles in promoting preventive behaviors.",
            "Before we further discuss the findings, it is necessary to mention this study\u2019s limitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of the data limits our ability to make a strong inference about causal direction. For example, even though our findings indicated significant correlations between the two self-relevant emotions and personal-level risk perception, these correlations alone do not establish any direction of influence. One could interpret the hypothesized correlations as indicating that fear and anger provoked by exposure to risk information about MERS on social media may increase personal-level risk perception of the disease. At the same time, however, it is equally plausible that those who perceive greater risk are likely to be highly fearful or angry. Researchers have pointed out the difficulty of establishing whether emotion or cognition comes first. A causal relationship between emotion and cognition is hard to generalize. Studies on fear appeal, such as those on the extended parallel process model (EPPM; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWitte_1992_a\" href=\"#rWitte_1992_a\">Witte, 1992</a>), posit that risk perception (cognition) induces fear (emotion). For this reason, research guided by EPPM has used risk perception, not fear, in models (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChae_2019_a\" href=\"#rChae_2019_a\">Chae & Lee, 2019</a>). However, fear in the fear appeal literature is different from fear examined in this study given that most fear appeal studies have focused on emotional states induced by a single message. Fear in this study is an emotional state elicited by repeated exposure to MERS-related information on social media. As Chae and Lee (2019) indicated, if fear exists only as a consequence of risk perception, both should have the same effects on subsequent behaviors. However, evidence shows that they have different effects. For example, increased risk perception of breast cancer is positively related to cancer screening (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKatapodi_et+al_2004_a\" href=\"#rKatapodi_et+al_2004_a\">Katapodi, Lee, Facione, & Dodd, 2004</a>), whereas cancer-related fear can reduce that behavior (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMiles_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rMiles_et+al_2008_a\">Miles, Voorwinden, Chapman, & Wardle, 2008</a>). Future investigations employing an experimental or longitudinal design would better demonstrate the causal directions hypothesized in this study.",
            "Another shortcoming of this study is that we used a single item to measure social media exposure. A single measure of social media may not completely capture its effect because social media can take various forms (e.g., content oriented vs. user oriented); depending on the form, the media can have differential effects (e.g., <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYoo_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rYoo_et+al_2018_a\">Yoo et al, 2018</a>). While various social media platforms have distinctive features, they share common basic operations, allowing users to create or distribute content (Westerman, Spence, & Van Der Heide, 2014) and to obtain additional information on specific issues via users\u2019 comments (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_2016_a\" href=\"#rLee_2016_a\">Lee & Chun, 2016</a>). For this reason, some previous studies also used a single item to examine the effects of social media in risk communication (e.g., <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChoi_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rChoi_et+al_2017_a\">Choi, Yoo, Noh, & Park, 2017</a>; Yoo et al, 2016). Furthermore, people do not use a single social media platform exclusively; rather, they use more than one platform to obtain information. For example, a recent survey (Pew Research Center, 2018) shows that more than 90% of Twitter users also use Facebook and YouTube. Therefore, it is worthwhile to examine the effects of social media as an information source as a whole during infectious disease outbreaks, rather than focusing on the different effects of specific platforms. With regard to the strategic use of various social media platforms, however, it will be worthwhile to investigate the different impacts of different social media platforms in future research (e.g., Facebook vs. Twitter).",
            "Lastly, we did not investigate the sources of risk information on social media. Social media exposure may occur via various information sources, such as government agencies, the media, friends, and family (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChoi_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rChoi_et+al_2017_a\">Choi et al, 2017</a>). In particular, because social media users build their online networks to include mainly their acquaintances, these users seem more likely to vividly sympathize with the emotions of others in their networks, which, in turn, may increase the users\u2019 self-relevant emotions. To better understand the effect of social media during infectious disease outbreaks, it would be interesting to explore how various types of information sources influence emotional responses and how such responses shape risk perception and preventive behaviors.",
            "In terms of practical implications, our findings suggest that public health communicators and policymakers should pay more attention to the roles of emotions during infectious disease outbreaks. The findings of this study support the idea that people use social media to express not only factual information but also emotion-filled dialogue about public health crises (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDo_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rDo_et+al_2016_a\">Do et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOfoghi_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rOfoghi_et+al_2016_a\">Ofoghi et al, 2016</a>), and this dialogue can influence how they perceive and behave in response to the crisis. Studies have found that members of the public may not tolerate situations with even insignificant levels of risk if they believe that government agencies are unconcerned and unresponsive to their wellbeing (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMaxwell_2003_a\" href=\"#rMaxwell_2003_a\">Maxwell, 2003</a>). Our findings indicate that it may not be effective crisis management to disregard the public\u2019s emotional responses as irrational overreactions during a public health crisis. Tracking public emotions through social media monitoring could be used to better communicate with ordinary citizens during an infectious disease outbreak.",
            "Effective communication with the public by public health agencies and governments is among the most important components of successful pandemic responses (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLee_2013_a\" href=\"#rLee_2013_a\">Lee & Basnyat, 2013</a>). Successful communication can help the public adopt appropriate behaviors to stop the spread of an outbreak (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cReynolds_2005_a\" href=\"#rReynolds_2005_a\">Reynolds & Seeger, 2005</a>). In contrast, unsuccessful communication can ignite community outrage and hinder risk mitigation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMaxwell_2003_a\" href=\"#rMaxwell_2003_a\">Maxwell, 2003</a>). This study\u2019s findings can help policymakers and communicators better understand the complex process of emotions and cognition provoked by infectious disease outbreaks and develop better communication strategies."
