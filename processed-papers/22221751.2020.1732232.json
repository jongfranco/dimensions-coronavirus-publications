Another 100+ exported cases have been confirmed in other countries worldwide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. During 10:30am to 10:30pm, January 29th, 2020 (UTC + 8), we initiated an online survey on people\u2019s knowledge on NCIP by snowball sampling via Wechat invitation. 3083 invitees of 18\u2013 59 years old (2/3 females and 4/5 with bachelor\u2019s degree or higher) from all provinces in mainland China were enrolled, three quarters of which were from the six most developed provinces in China (Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shandong, Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu).",
