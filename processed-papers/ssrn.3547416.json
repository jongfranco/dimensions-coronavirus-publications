        "abstract": "As dated 23 February China\u2019s newly recovered coronavirus patients outnumber new infections for 5th consecutive day while 18 new infections on mainland regions outside Hubei with 21 province level regions recording zero new infections. The present study is focusing on evaluating the daily and weekly percentage marginal change for the COVID - 19\u2019s Confirmed Cases, Recovered Cases, and the Death Cases from the period dated 20th January 2020 to 23 February 2020 in China. To find the desired results the study applied the Ordinary Least Square Method (OLS) to assess the daily marginal average percentage change for the COVID - 19\u2019s Confirmed Cases, Recovered Cases and the Death Cases from the week dated 20 January 2020 to 23 February 2020 in China. Daily reported time series data from china statistics from dated 20 January 2020 to 23 February 2020 were used to make the study accomplished. To evaluate the percentage marginal change for the COVID - 19 Confirmed cases, recovered cases, and the death cases the study calculates the daily and weekly percentage maginal percentage average change for the sub divided weeks that are (20 Jan 2020-26 Jan 2020), (27 Jan 2020- 2 Feb 2020), (3Feb 2020 - 9 Feb 2020), (10 Feb 2020 - 16 Feb 2020), and (17 Feb 2020- 23 Feb 2020). The findings of the study were in actual fact catching up the attention. The study findings revealed that the COVID - Confirmed cases and Death cases weekly marginal average percentage change is continuously declining from the week dated January 2020 to 23 February 2020 in China. However, the COVID - 19 recovered cases weekly marginal average change is increasing at decreasing rate. Evidence study findings justified that significant China Government efforts and measures to fight the battle of C OVID- has a positive outcome and meaningful within the period dated Jan 2020 to 23 February 2020 in China.",
