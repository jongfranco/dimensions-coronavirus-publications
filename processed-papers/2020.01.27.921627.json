        "abstract": "2019-nCov has caused more than 80 deaths as of 27 January 2020 in China, and infection cases have been reported in more than 10 countries. However, there is no approved drug to treat the disease. 2019-nCov Mpro is a potential drug target to combat the virus. We built homology models based on SARS Mpro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known Mpro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir, with the binding free energy of \u221224.69\u00b10.52 kcal/mol and \u22129.42\u00b10.04 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore, we suggested that nelfinavir might be a potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov Mpro.",

            "2019-nCov has caused more than 80 deaths as of 27 January 2020 in China, and infection cases have been reported in more than 10 countries. However, there is no approved drug to treat the disease. 2019-nCov Mpro is a potential drug target to combat the virus. We built homology models based on SARS Mpro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known Mpro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir, with the binding free energy of -24.69\u00b10.52 kcal/mol and -9.42\u00b10.04 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore, we suggested that nelfinavir might be a potential inhibitor against 2019nCov Mpro."

Therefore, it is urgent to discover and develop drugs to cure the disease.",
            "Based on its function, the main protease (Mpro) or chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] is suggested to be a potential drug target to combat 2019-nCov, which is highly conservable among coronaviruses. Sequence alignment revealed that the Mpro of 2019-nCov shares 96% similarity with that of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) (Figure 1). Studies for identifying the inhibitors of 2019-nCov Mpro were quickly performed for discovering and developing drugs against the disease. For example, Hualiang Jiang and collaborators identified 30 drugs and compounds as the Mpro inhibitors via protein modelling and virtual screening, which is a rapid progress in the way to cope with the crisis. In addition, one of the 30 drugs/compounds, remdesivir, was also suggested to be potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov by Liu et al,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] who also suggested 3 other possible inhibitors.",
            "For finding more potential drugs as inhibitors of the protein, we modelled the 2019-nCov Mpro structures using SARS Mpro (PDB ID: 2GTB) as template and docked 1903 approved drugs against the model in this study. Fifteen drugs were selected based on the docking score and three dimensional (3D) similarity to available Mpro inhibitors against other coronavirus. For validation, we modelled 10 additional new models of 2019-nCov Mpro and docked the 15 drugs against the new models, which revealed that 6 drugs (nelfinavir, praziquantel, pitavastatin, perampanel, eszopiclone, and zopiclone) have good binding modes with the new models. Binding free energy calculation were then performed for 4 of the 6 drugs using MM/GBSA and SIE methods. Nelfinavir was identified as the best one with predicted binding free energies of -24.69\u00b10.52 kcal/mol by MM/GBSA and -9.42\u00b10.04 kcal/mol by SIE, respectively. Taking into account its high 3D similarity of binding mode to the known Mpro inhibitor, we proposed that nelfinavir should be a potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov Mpro."

There are 672 drugs with the docking score better than -7.0 kcal/mol. The binding modes are essential to the activities. If a compound shares a similar binding mode to a known ligand, it is more likely to have a similar activity to the ligand.

In results of the MM/GBSA approach, the calculated binding free energies of nelfinavir-2GX4, pitavastatin-2GTB, perampanel-5NH0, and praziquantel-3V3M, are -24.69\u00b10.52, -12.70\u00b10.38, 14.98\u00b10.34, and -6.51\u00b10.21 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 4), which highlight nelfinavir as the most active one. In pitavastatin-2GTB, perampanel-5NH0, and praziquantel-3V3M, the van der Waals interaction (Evdw) makes a more significant contribution than the electrostatic interaction (Eele) (Table 4), indicating that van der Waals interaction is the main driving force for the 3 drugs binding. However, the Eele interaction of nelfinavir-2GX4 is very strong, suggesting that the electrostatic interaction also play an important role in the binding of nelfinavir. Furthermore, in results of the SIE approach, the rank of the calculated binding free energies for the 4 docking complexes is consistent with that of the MM/GBSA approach (Table 5) that the nelfinavir has the strongest binding free energy (-9.42\u00b10.04 kcal/mol), indicating the reliability of the current binding free energy analysis.",

Our docking results showed that three of the hydrogen bonds involving GLU-166 and GLN-189 maintained upon the binding of nelfinavir and 2019nCov Mpro, with additionally the possible formation of \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction with HIS-41 (Figure 2d).

            "2019-nCov caused more than 80 deaths in China as of 27 January 2020 and is a potential threat to the global health. However, there is no approved drug to treat the disease. 2019-nCov Mpro is a potential drug target to combat the virus, which shares 96% sequence similarity with the corresponding one in SARS. We built 11 homology models of 2019-nCov Mpro and docked 1903 approved small molecule drugs to the 2GTB model. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of binding mode to 39 known Mpro binders, 15 drugs were selected for further evaluation. The 15 drugs were then docked to all the 11 homology models, leading to 4 drugs for binding energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE calculations voted for nelfinavir, a HIV-1 protease inhibitor to treat HIV. Therefore, we suggested that nelfinavir might be active against 2019-nCov Mpro. In addition, pitavastatin, perampanel, and praziquantel might also have moderate activities against 2019-nCov."
