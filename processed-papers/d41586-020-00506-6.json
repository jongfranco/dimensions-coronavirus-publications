            "The researchers trained the AI to spot molecules that inhibit the growth of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Once trained, the program screened more than 100 million molecular structures to identify those with antibacterial activity.",

One \u2014 a potential diabetes treatment \u2014 was a potent antibiotic, which they called halicin after HAL, the intelligent computer in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey. In mouse tests, it was active against multiple pathogens, including a strain of Clostridioides difficile and one of Acinetobacter baumannii that is \u2018pan-resistant\u2019 and against which new antibiotics are urgently required.",

            "China\u2019s top law-making body has banned the eating of wildanimal meat in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which has been linked to a wild-animal market in the city of Wuhan.",
            "Last month, the national government temporarily suspended the buying and selling of wild-animal products, which are commonly used for food, fur and in traditional medicines in China. On 24 February, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress passed a resolution banning the consumption of wild meat, including from animals bred or reared in captivity.",
            "The ban does not apply to aquatic wildlife, such as fishes, to animals long bred for meat consumption, such as rabbits and pigeons, or to domesticated animals such as pigs, cows, chickens and geese. It will take immediate effect. The use of wild animals for scientific research and medicine will be regulated by existing laws.",
            "Some researchers had called for a total ban on wildlife trade, whereas others say sustainable trade in some animals is possible and beneficial for people who rely on it for their livelihoods. Banning wild meat could cost the Chinese economy 50 billion yuan (US$7.1 billion) and put one million people out of a job, according to estimates from the non-profit Society of Entrepreneurs and Ecology in Beijing.",
            "The United Kingdom has another new science minister, but the role seems to have been downgraded. The latest incumbent, Amanda Solloway (pictured), comes to the job with little ministerial experience, and is a parliamentary undersecretary of state in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), which oversees science, rather than a more senior minister of state like her immediate predecessors.",
            "That shift is in conflict with a government that has an ambitious research agenda, say observers. \u201cIt sends mixed messages,\u201d says Kieron Flanagan, who studies science policy at the University of Manchester, UK.",
            "The apparent downgrade is a sign that those at the highest levels of government are keen to direct the research agenda, says James Wilsdon, a science-policy researcher at the University of Sheffield, UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government \u2014 particularly his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings \u2014 have big plans for science, including launching an agency for highrisk, high-reward research. The appointment \u201ccan\u2019t help but reinforce suspicions that the real driving force behind UK science policy, at least for now, will remain Dominic Cummings and others in Number Ten\u201d."

Birds of prey and waterbirds seem to have been hit particularly hard owing to habitat destruction, hunting and the pet trade.",

            "The report\u2019s authors \u2014 researchers from 10 government and non-profit research and conservation groups \u2014 used eBird data to analyse long-term trends for 261 bird species by evaluating the proportional change in the frequency of reported sightings since 1993. They found that more than half of those species have declined since 2000. The group also looked at the current annual trends in 146 species; nearly 80% have declined in the past 5 years."

            "Scientists in Hungary are protesting against a plan to move Budapest\u2019s 200-year-old natural-history museum to a town called Debrecen in the nation\u2019s east.",
            "The move is part of a government plan to decentralize some of Budapest\u2019s cultural treasures. The museum collection, which contains more than 10 million items that are important for evolutionarybiology and palaeontology research, would move from its current home at the Ludovica academy. But researchers say that this could damage specimens, disrupt research projects and make future projects logistically difficult because the Debrecen is some 200 kilometres from the capital.",
            "This month, scientists sent a public petition with 14,000 signatures to the ministry of human capacities \u2014 one of the ministries overseeing the move \u2014 calling for the museum to stay in Budapest. The petition commended the government plan to try to develop rural areas, but it noted that a survey of museum staff members, conducted last summer, found that 87% of them would not be prepared to move to Debrecen. The museum has about 140 staff members, around one-third of whom are scientists.",
            "\u201cThere would be a devastating loss of expertise,\u201d says evolutionary biologist J\u00e1nos Podani from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University in Budapest, who is also a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS) and leads a group whose research uses museum collections.",

But the figures have been in flux, and case numbers will probably rise in the coming days, given that the number of deaths compared with overall case numbers is much higher than that reported elsewhere.",
