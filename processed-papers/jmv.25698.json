        "abstract": "The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV) outbreak has caused a large number of deaths with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, especially in East Asia. This study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019\u2010nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide\u2010binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for the development of 2019\u2010nCoV vaccines.",

We compared the epitopes obtained in our study with epitopes predicted in the spike protein of MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] We found one overlapping CTL epitope between MERS\u2010CoV and 2019\u2010nCoV with one gap and one mismatch (YLQPRTFLL/YKLQPLTFLL), and no comparable epitopes with SARS\u2010CoV. In addition to the activation of CTLs, successful immunogens need to generate a persistent humoral immunity and in our study, we identified three sequential and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein.",
            "There are a few limitations of our study. Epitope detection in glycoproteins is often complicated by the presence of covalently attached glycans. Modeling viral glycoproteins with the associated glycans is especially challenging due to the lack of related structures, although attempts have been made in hepatitis C and rabies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] Second, similar to other RNA virus, coronavirus replication is error\u2010prone, with a reported mutation rate of 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions per site per year in SARS\u2010CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] This necessitates urgency in antiviral vaccine development before the identified epitopes are potentially rendered obsolete.",
