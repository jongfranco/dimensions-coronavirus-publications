            "In conclusion, characteristic chest CT imaging features and Wuhan exposure or close contact history, highly suggest COVID-19 pneumonia, although RT-PCR remains the reference standard. Typical CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia include multifocal bilateral GGOs with patchy consolidations, prominent peripherally subpleural distribution, and preferred posterior part or lower lobe predilection. Thin slice chest CT can help prompt diagnosis, guide clinical decision making, and monitor disease progression, playing a critical role in the early prevention and control of COVID-19. Special attention should be paid to the role of radiologists in fighting"

Wuhan exposure history or close contact with confirmed or suspected patients is an essential clue for the diagnosis. However, for patients with unknown epidemiological history, typical clinical and imaging appearance can indicate suspected COVID-19; RT-PCR test should be performed in these patients. In summary, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should combine epidemiological history, clinical and imaging manifestations, and RT-PCR test (the reference standard).",
            "Although chest CT findings are nonspecific for COVID-19 detection, CT findings have been recommended as major evidence of clinical diagnosis in Hubei province by the National Health and Health Commission of China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 remains the reference standard [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>], but RT-PCR results can be affected by sampling errors and low virus load (6466). Previous SARS studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>] showed that RT-PCR lacked sensitivity during the first five days of the disease.

            "CT can also assess the disease severity of COVID-19 to guide clinical management. Clinical observations showed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] that intensive care unit (ICU) patients on admission often presented with bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental consolidation, while non-ICU patients",
            "P presented with bilateral GGOs and subsegmental consolidation.

Chung et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>] found that 7 of 8 patients showed marked progression presenting as increasing number, extent, and density of GGOs (Figures 4, 9). Pan et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>] reviewed 21 confirmed and recovered patients who underwent repeated CT at approximately 4-day intervals and summarized four stages of the disease: early, progressive, peak, and absorption. They found that GGOs will rapidly grow, demonstrating consolidation and crazy-paving pattern as the disease progresses. The lesions will absorb without crazy-paving pattern on absorption stage, suggesting crazy-paving pattern as another index to evaluate the disease course. The study by Song et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>] concluded that greater consolidation indicated disease progression.

            "In conclusion, characteristic chest CT imaging features and Wuhan exposure or close contact history, highly suggest COVID-19 pneumonia, although RT-PCR remains the reference standard. Typical CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia include multifocal bilateral GGOs with patchy consolidations, prominent peripherally subpleural distribution, and preferred posterior part or lower lobe predilection. Thin slice chest CT can help prompt diagnosis, guide clinical decision making, and monitor disease progression, playing a critical role in the early prevention and control of COVID-19.
