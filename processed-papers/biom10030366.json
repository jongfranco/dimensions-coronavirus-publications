        "abstract": "Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze is a Chinese herbal medicine used in the treatment of respiratory virus infections. The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf contains chemical components such as \u03b2-sitosterol, indirubin, tryptanthrin, betulin, indigodole A, and indigodole B that have diverse biological activities. However, the antiviral action of S. cusia leaf and its components against human coronavirus remains to be elucidated. Human coronavirus NL63 infection is frequent among immunocompromised individuals, young children, and in the elderly. This study investigated the anti-Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) activity of the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf and its major components. The methanol extract of S. cusia leaf effectively inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) and virus yield (IC50 = 0.64 \u03bcg/mL) in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. Moreover, this extract potently inhibited the HCoV-NL63 infection in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the six components identified in the methanol extract of S. cusia leaf, tryptanthrin and indigodole B (5aR-ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited potent antiviral activity in reducing the CPE and progeny virus production. The IC50 values against virus yield were 1.52 \u03bcM and 2.60 \u03bcM for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively. Different modes of time-of-addition/removal assay indicated that tryptanthrin prevented the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 replication, particularly by blocking viral RNA genome synthesis and papain-like protease 2 activity. Notably, tryptanthrin (IC50 = 0.06 \u03bcM) and indigodole B (IC50 = 2.09 \u03bcM) exhibited strong virucidal activity as well. This study identified tryptanthrin as the key active component of S. cusia leaf methanol extract that acted against HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner. The results specify that tryptanthrin possesses antiviral potential against HCoV-NL63 infection.",

S. cusia root and leaf extracts have been used extensively as a traditional herbal medicine with anti\u2010 inflammatory, antipyretic, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The S. cusia root (named \u201cNan\u2010 Ban\u2010Lan\u2010Gen\u201d in Chinese) has been commonly used to treat infections by respiratory virus, such as influenza viruses, mumps virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>].

            "This study was the first to demonstrate the antiviral efficacy of S. cusia leaf methanol extract against HCoV\u2010NL63 (Figures 1, 2 and Table 1). The S. cusia extract significantly reduced progeny virus production (IC50 = 0.64 \u03bcg/mL) and inhibited viral infectivity (<0.01 \u03bcg/mL). Notably, tryptanthrin and indigodole B were originally identified as the compounds in the S. cusia leaf methanol extract with highest activity against HCoV\u2010NL63 (Figures 3\u20135, Table 1). Tryptanthrin was first reported as the distinct antiviral agent to reduce HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010induced CPE and to drastically inhibit the progeny virus production in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (IC50 = 1.52 \u03bcM) (Figure 4). Indigodole B, recently identified in S. cusia leaf methanol extract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], is a tryptanthrin derivative conjugated with the ethyl group at C\u20105a (5aR\u2010ethyltryptanthrin), and exhibited intense antiviral activity with an IC50 of 2.60 \u03bcM against virus yield (Figure 4). Previous studies revealed several active antiviral compounds in the S. cusia extract against Herpes simplex virus\u20101 (IC50 = 49.3 \u03bcM by lupeol) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and influenza A virus (IC50 = 29.2 \u03bcM by strobilanthes A, IC50 = 46.0 \u03bcM by 2(3H)\u2010benzoxazolinone, and IC50 = 31.48\u201371.57 \u03bcg/mL by aurantiamide acetate) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Moreover, \u03b2\u2010sitosterol was denoted as the inhibitor of the SARS coronavirus 3C\u2010like protease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], and exerted marginal inhibitory activity against HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010induced CPE. Therefore, S. cusia contains several active chemical constituents like tryptanthrin and indigodole B against various viruses, such as coronaviruses and influenza viruses."

        "conclusions": [
            "This study indicates that tryptanthrin was identified as the major active component in S. cusia leaf methanol extract that inhibits HCoV\u2010NL63 replication in a cell\u2010type\u2010independent manner. Interestingly, tryptanthrin serves a higher antiviral activity against HCoV\u2010NL63 than indigodole B (5aR\u2010ethyltryptanthrin) that has an additional ethyl moiety at C5a instead of double bond in tryptanthrin, revealing the double bond in quinazoline ring of tryptanthrin skeleton as the active contributor to prove the antiviral activity. Moreover, tryptanthrin specifically alters the antigenic structure of viral spike proteins and inhibits the cleavage activity of PLP2, as associated with virucidal activity and inhibiting the post\u2010entry stage of HCoV\u2010NL63 replication with IC50 of less than 0.1 \u03bcM. Interestingly, HCoV\u2010NL63 spike protein shows a highly conserved sequence and structural similarity to SARS\u2010CoV and COVID\u201019, linking it with the fact that all these viruses have the ACE2 receptor usage. Thus, tryptanthrin, exhibiting the virucidal action and impeding post\u2010entry replication, might be developed as one of the first hit compounds against human coronaviruses.<br/><br/>Author Contributions: Conceptualization, C.\u2010L.L., H.\u2010R.Y., S.\u2010H.H., and C.\u2010W.L.; methodology, Y.\u2010C.T., Y.\u2010S.C., Y.\u2010P.L., and C.\u2010W.L.; formal analysis, Y.\u2010C.T., S.\u2010H.H., and C.\u2010W.L.; resources, C.\u2010L.L. and C.\u2010W.L.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, Y.\u2010C.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.\u2010H.H., and C.\u2010W.L.; visualization and supervision, C.\u2010L.L., and H.\u2010R.Y.; funding acquisition, C.\u2010W.L.

S. cusia root and leaf extracts have been used extensively as a traditional herbal medicine with anti\u2010 inflammatory, antipyretic, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The S. cusia root (named \u201cNan\u2010 Ban\u2010Lan\u2010Gen\u201d in Chinese) has been commonly used to treat infections by respiratory virus, such as influenza viruses, mumps virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Several bioactive components from the S. cusia root, including strobilanthes A, 3H\u2010benzoxazolinone, and aurantiamide acetate, have exhibited antiviral activity against influenza A and hepatitis B virus infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. The S. cusia leaf (called \u201cDa\u2010Ching\u2010Yeh\u201d in Chinese) is generally used for the production of indigo dyes (Indigo Natruralis, named \u201cQing Dai\u201d in Chinese), displaying antibacterial, anti\u2010inflammatory, and antipyretic properties [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].

HCoV\u2010NL63 is primarily associated with immunocompromised patients with respiratory illnesses, young children, and the elderly [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Symptoms of HCoV\u2010NL63 infection include common cold, rhinorrhea, cough, fever, tachypnea, and obstructive laryngitis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. Recently, HCoV\u2010NL63 induced an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in long\u2010term care institutions in Louisiana. In 20 cases with patients aged between 66 and 96, six patients with pneumonia were hospitalized and three patients died [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Moreover, HCoV\u2010NL63 was isolated from the blood, urine, and stool samples of children with febrile illness, causing systemic illness in rural Haiti [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. HCoV\u2010NL63 has become one of the primary pathogens in respiratory viral diseases; however, there are no effective antivirals for treating HCoV\u2010NL63 infection.",

In addition, the effect of stomach acid on inactivation of the tryptanthrin was further assayed. Tryptanthrin was incubated in 0.01 N HCl (pH 2.0) for 15 or 60 min, neutralized with PBS, and the residual activity of CPE reduction in HCoV\u2010NL63 infected cells at the MOI of 0.01 was evaluated. In the virus yield reduction assay, the supernatant from untreated or treated infected cells was diluted to quantify the virus titer using the plaque assay. Serial dilutions of the supernatant were added onto the monolayer of LLC\u2010MK2 cells for 1 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C to enable attachment and entry; the cells were overlaid using 2% agarose in MEM containing 2% FBS. After 48 h of incubation, the cell monolayer was stained with naphthol blue\u2010black dye; the plaques in the LLC\u2010MK2 cell monolayer were counted to determine the virus titer. The virus yield reduction was calculated as the reduced rate of plaque content in the treated infected cells compared to the untreated infected cells. Fifty percent (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated as the percentage of virus yield reduction by the abovementioned concentrations of the extract and active compounds. In addition, the antiviral activity of the active compounds was examined in human lung epithelial Calu\u20103 cells at 32 \u00b0C; 1 \u00d7 105 Calu\u20103 cells per well were cultured overnight in 6\u2010well plates, infected with HCoV\u2010NL63 at an MOI of 0.05, and immediately treated with the indicated concentration of the active compounds.

After 2 h of incubation, the mixture of virus and compound was removed; the infectivity inhibition assay was performed subsequently using immunofluorescent staining. In the post\u2010infection treatment/removal mode, the cells were subjected to HCoV\u2010NL63 infection for 2 h, treated with active compounds for an additional 2 h, and washed with PBS for removing the mixture of virus and the compound. The residual infectivity in both modes was determined by the relative levels of HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010positive cells. Moreover, the supernatant and the lysate from the infected cells in both modes were collected for examining the titers of extracellular virions using the plaque assay, as described above. In addition, HCoV\u2010NL63 RNA genomes in LLC\u2010MK2 cells treated by both modes were quantified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010qPCR). The total RNA from treated/infected cells at 24 h post\u2010infection was extracted using the PureLink Mini Total RNA Purification Kit (ThermoFisher), reverse transcribed with the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase and oligo (dT), and analyzed using SYBR Green\u2010based real time PCR with a HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010specific primer pair (5\u2032\u2010CACAGATTTTTGGACGGTTGC\u20103\u2032 and 5\u2032\u2010TGTGTTGATAATAAATGGGGAGTG\u20103\u2032), and a \u03b2\u2010actin gene\u2010specific primer pair (5\u2032\u2010CAACTGGGACGACATGGAGAAAAT\u20103\u2032 and 5\u2032\u2010 CCAGAGGCGTACAGGGATAGCAC\u20103\u2032).

The S. cusia leaf methanol extract reduced HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010induced CPE in LLC\u2010MK2 cells in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (Figure 1A). The plaque assay indicated that the S. cusia leaf methanol extract exhibited a strong inhibitory effect against the production of progeny HCoV\u2010NL63 virions released into the cultured media of LLC\u2010MK2 cells at 37 \u00b0C 48 h post\u2010infection (Figure 1B). The IC50 value of S. cusia leaf methanol extract against virus yield in LLC\u2010MK2 cells was 0.64 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 1B, Table 1). Immunofluorescent staining with anti\u2010HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010immunized sera revealed that the S. cusia leaf methanol extract inhibited the HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010infected LLC\u2010MK2 positivity at 37 \u00b0C 36 h post\u2010infection in a concentration\u2010dependent manner as well (Figure 2A).

Moreover, the plaque assay revealed that tryptanthrin and indigodole B exerted a potent inhibitory effect on the in vitro progeny production of HCoV\u2010NL63 (Figure 4D\u2013E), wherein IC50 values for virus yield were 1.52 \u03bcM and 2.60 \u03bcM for tryptanthrin and indigole B, respectively (Table 1). Therefore, similar to the S. cusia leaf methanol extract, tryptanthrin and indigodole B (5aR\u2010ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited low cytotoxicity and high antiviral potential against HCoV\u2010NL63.",

To examine the antiviral efficacy of the highest active component, tryptanthrin, in LLC\u2010MK2 cells, the infectivity inhibitory effect of tryptanthrin against HCoV\u2010NL63 was tested in Calu\u20103 cells using CPE reduction and infectivity inhibition assays (Figure 5). The antiviral assays with human lung epithelial Calu\u20103 cells were performed at 32 \u00b0C and analyzed 36 h post\u2010infection (Figure 5). Tryptanthrin inhibited the HCoV\u2010 NL63\u2010induced CPE in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (Figure 5A, top). Immunofluorescent staining indicated that tryptanthrin significantly reduced the percentage of HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010positive cells (Figure 5A, middle and bottom), markedly reducing the HCoV\u2010NL63 infectivity with an IC50 value of 0.30 \u03bcM in human lung epithelial Calu\u20103 cells (Figure 5B, Table 1). The results confirmed that tryptanthrin exhibited a cell\u2010type independent anti\u2010HCoV\u2010NL63 activity with IC50 values of 1.52 \u03bcM and 0.30 \u03bcM in LCC\u2010MK2 and Calu\u20103 cells, respectively."

            "To explore whether tryptanthrin interferes with HCoV\u2010NL63 replication, different modes of time\u2010of\u2010addition/removal assay were performed to examine the inhibitory effect of tryptanthrin on early and late stages of replication (Figures 6 and 7). The infectivity assay with immunofluorescent staining indicated that tryptanthrin directly reduced the percentage of HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010positive cells in both modes (Figure 6A,C), exhibiting a strong inhibitory effect in the early and late stages of HCoV\u2010 NL63 replication. Tryptanthrin was more potent in impeding the late stage (IC50 = 0.06 \u03bcM) than the early stage (IC50 = 0.32 \u03bcM) (Figure 6D vs. Figure 6B, Table 1). In the plaque assay, tryptanthrin markedly reduced the production of extracellular virions in these two modes, implying that it significantly blocked virus production at the early and late stages (Figure 7). In addition, tryptanthrin exhibited a higher inhibitory activity against the production of extracellular virions in the late stage (IC50 = 0.05 \u03bcM) than in the early stage (IC50 = 6.99 \u03bcM) (Figure 7A,B, Table 1).",

            "Tryptanthrin exhibited a higher effective inhibitory effect during the late stage of HCoV\u2010NL63 replication cycle than the early stage; thus, the functional activity of possible targets, such as viral RNA polymerase and protease, was further measured in the time\u2010of\u2010addition/removal assay and the in vitro trans\u2010cleavage test. The RT\u2010qPCR assay revealed that tryptanthrin reduced the number of HCoV\u2010NL63 RNA genomes in the post\u2010infection treatment/removal mode more effectively than in the co\u2010treatment/removal mode (Figure 8). The result indicated that tryptanthrin possibly reduced the transcriptional action of HCoV\u2010NL63 RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase during viral replication. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of tryptanthrin on the protease activity of HCoV\u2010NL63 PLP2 was further detected using the in vitro trans\u2010cleavage assay (Figure 9). Recombinant HCoV\u2010NL63 PLP2 protein with a His tag was synthesized in E. coli and purified using the immobilized metal affinity chromatography. SDS\u2010PAGE and Western blotting assays determined the purity and integrity of recombinant HCoV\u2010NL63 PLP2 protein with a molecular weight of approximately 36 kDa (Figure 9A). Recombinant PLP2 protein exhibited proteolytic activity on the substrate HRP in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (Figure 9B). Notably, tryptanthrin exhibited dose\u2010dependent inhibition of recombinant PLP2\u2010mediated trans\u2010cleavage on HRP (Figure 9C,D). The results indicated that the antiviral activity of tryptanthrin against HCoV\u2010NL63 was associated with the inhibitory action on viral RNA genome synthesis and PLP2 activity during the later stage of in vitro replication that was linked with the viral infectivity and virion production."

        "3.6. Virucidal Activity of Tryptanthrin against HCoV\u2010NL63": [
            "To determine the virucidal activity of tryptanthrin against HCoV\u2010NL63, the virucidal assay was performed by pre\u2010incubation of the high\u2010titer HCoV\u2010NL63 with tryptanthrin at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h (Figure 10A). For determining the residual infectivity, the 1000\u2010fold dilution of the mixture was used in the plaque assay based on the negligible effects of tryptanthrin on plaque formation. Tryptanthrin exhibited a significant virucidal activity in a concentration\u2010dependent manner at 37 \u00b0C, and the IC50 value of tryptanthrin for virucidal activity was 0.06 \u03bcM (Figure 10A, Table 1). Subsequently, the virucidal activity of indigodole B and S. cusia leaf methanol extract were evaluated (Figure 10B,C). Notably, indigodole B and S. cusia leaf methanol extract exhibited virucidal activity in a concentration\u2010dependent manner for which the IC50 values were 2.09 \u03bcM for indigodole B and 0.12 \u03bcg/mL for S. cusia extract (Figure 10B,C, Table 1). The results indicated that tryptanthrin and indigodole B functioned as critical components eliciting virucidal activity in S. cusia leaf methanol extract. Moreover, the dot\u2010blotting assay using the virus/compound mixture after a 1\u2010h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, which was used to examine the effect of tryptanthrin on surface protein integrity of HCoV\u2010 NL63, revealed that tryptanthrin altered the antigenic structure of HCoV\u2010NL63 structural proteins (spike and envelope proteins, which were associated with the inactivation of viral infectivity) (Figure 11)."
        ],
        "4. Discussion": [
            "This study was the first to demonstrate the antiviral efficacy of S. cusia leaf methanol extract against HCoV\u2010NL63 (Figures 1, 2 and Table 1). The S. cusia extract significantly reduced progeny virus production (IC50 = 0.64 \u03bcg/mL) and inhibited viral infectivity (<0.01 \u03bcg/mL). Notably, tryptanthrin and indigodole B were originally identified as the compounds in the S. cusia leaf methanol extract with highest activity against HCoV\u2010NL63 (Figures 3\u20135, Table 1). Tryptanthrin was first reported as the distinct antiviral agent to reduce HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010induced CPE and to drastically inhibit the progeny virus production in a concentration\u2010dependent manner (IC50 = 1.52 \u03bcM) (Figure 4). Indigodole B, recently identified in S. cusia leaf methanol extract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], is a tryptanthrin derivative conjugated with the ethyl group at C\u20105a (5aR\u2010ethyltryptanthrin), and exhibited intense antiviral activity with an IC50 of 2.60 \u03bcM against virus yield (Figure 4). Previous studies revealed several active antiviral compounds in the S. cusia extract against Herpes simplex virus\u20101 (IC50 = 49.3 \u03bcM by lupeol) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], and influenza A virus (IC50 = 29.2 \u03bcM by strobilanthes A, IC50 = 46.0 \u03bcM by 2(3H)\u2010benzoxazolinone, and IC50 = 31.48\u201371.57 \u03bcg/mL by aurantiamide acetate) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Moreover, \u03b2\u2010sitosterol was denoted as the inhibitor of the SARS coronavirus 3C\u2010like protease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], and exerted marginal inhibitory activity against HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010induced CPE. Therefore, S. cusia contains several active chemical constituents like tryptanthrin and indigodole B against various viruses, such as coronaviruses and influenza viruses.",
            "The antiviral activity of tryptanthrin and indigodole B was first reported in this study (Figures 3\u20139, Table 1). Tryptanthrin and indigodole B were less toxic to LCC\u2010MK2 and Calu\u20103 cells (Table 1). Previous reports showed that tryptanthrin had no significant cytotoxic effect on the survival rates of human normal cells such as human foreskin fibroblasts and mast cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Tryptanthrin exhibited better antiviral activity than its derivative indigodole B (Figures 3\u20134), exhibiting potent anti\u2010HCoV\u2010 NL63 activity by virus yield reduction in LLC\u2010MK2 cells (IC50 = 1.52 \u03bcM) and infectivity inhibition in Calu\u20103 cells (IC50 = 0.30 \u03bcM) (Figures 4\u20135, Table 1). Therefore, tryptanthrin inhibited HCoV\u2010NL63 infectivity in Calu\u20103 cells at 32 \u00b0C more effectively than that in LLC\u2010MK2 cells at 37 \u00b0C (Figures 4\u20135, Table 1). The results revealed that tryptanthrin functioned as a potent inhibitor with cell\u2010type\u2010 independent antiviral activity against HCoV\u2010NL63. Tryptanthrin significantly targeted viral enzymes like RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase and PLP2 that are involved in the late stages of HCoV\u2010NL63 replication, moderating the viral RNA genome synthesis and progeny virus production (Figures 6\u2013 9). Tryptanthrin was first isolated from S. cusia and also extracted from the other indigoferous plants, Persicaria tinctoria and Isatis tinctoria (also known as Isatis indigotica) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Tryptanthrin has a variety of pharmacological properties, such as antifungal (dermatophytes), antibacterial (Helicobacter pylori), anti\u2010inflammatory, and antitumor (leukemia, breast and colon cancer cells) properties [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>].",
            "In addition, tryptanthrin displayed anti\u2010angiogenic effect by improving skin lesions in psoriasis through regulation of ERK1/2 MAPK and PI3K\u2010mediated expression of apelin [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. Tryptanthrin exhibited anti\u2010neuroinflammatory action by inactivating NF\u2010\u03baB pathway to suppress TLR4\u2010 MyD88\u2010mediated inflammation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. Additionally, tryptanthrin exerted a hepatoprotective effect on oxidative stress through the activation of AMP\u2010activated protein kinase and p38 mitogen\u2010 activated protein kinase in HepG2 cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. Therefore, such pharmacological activities improved the antiviral potential of tryptanthrin against HCoV\u2010NL63 and other viruses.",
            "In addition to its antiviral activity, tryptanthrin demonstrated potent virucidal activity against HCoV\u2010NL63 (IC50 = 0.06 \u03bcM) (Figure 10A, and Table 1). Additionally, indigodole B and the S. cusia leaf methanol extract exhibited effective virucidal activity against HCoV\u2010NL63, with IC50 values of 2.09 \u03bcM for indigodole B and 0.12 \u03bcg/mL for S. cusia extract (Figure 10B,C, and Table 1). Therefore, tryptanthrin and indigodole B were suggested to be the key components in S. cusia leaf methanol extract that exerted the antiviral and virucidal effects against HCoV\u2010NL63. Since tryptanthrin was one of the critical components in Persicaria tinctoria and Isatis tinctoria (Isatis indigotica), it might play a role in the antiviral properties of the extracts against Influenza A and B, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and pseudorabies virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. Notably, Isatis tinctorial extract exhibited virucidal activity against Japanese encephalitis virus and pseudorabies virus. However, tryptanthrin was not identified as the antiviral compound in the Isatis tinctorial extract, possibly owing to the difference in the separation methods. Therefore, more studies are necessary to elucidate the antiviral activity of tryptanthrin against Influenza A and B, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and pseudorabies virus in future studies."

        "5. Conclusions": [
            "This study indicates that tryptanthrin was identified as the major active component in S. cusia leaf methanol extract that inhibits HCoV\u2010NL63 replication in a cell\u2010type\u2010independent manner. Interestingly, tryptanthrin serves a higher antiviral activity against HCoV\u2010NL63 than indigodole B (5aR\u2010ethyltryptanthrin) that has an additional ethyl moiety at C5a instead of double bond in tryptanthrin, revealing the double bond in quinazoline ring of tryptanthrin skeleton as the active contributor to prove the antiviral activity. Moreover, tryptanthrin specifically alters the antigenic structure of viral spike proteins and inhibits the cleavage activity of PLP2, as associated with virucidal activity and inhibiting the post\u2010entry stage of HCoV\u2010NL63 replication with IC50 of less than 0.1 \u03bcM. Interestingly, HCoV\u2010NL63 spike protein shows a highly conserved sequence and structural similarity to SARS\u2010CoV and COVID\u201019, linking it with the fact that all these viruses have the ACE2 receptor usage. Thus, tryptanthrin, exhibiting the virucidal action and impeding post\u2010entry replication, might be developed as one of the first hit compounds against human coronaviruses.",
