        "abstract": "It has been more than three decades since the first monoclonal antibody was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986, and during this time, antibody engineering has dramatically evolved. Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation. Finally, future applications and perspectives are also discussed.",

The other is brodalumab (Siliq, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, human IgG2), which binds to the IL-17 receptor to inhibit the action of IL-17 family cytokines. The two mAb drugs were approved by the US FDA for psoriasis treatment in 2015 and 2017, respectively. release of rheumatoid arthritis-related factors from hepatocytes. The two drugs were both approved in\nPY  - 2017\nDA  - 2017\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - GEN\nTI  - To improve the diversity of products and generate better antibody drugs, major development efforts have yielded models, such as the fully human antibody mouse and second-generation chimeric human antibody mice, over the 30 years since the first transgenic mouse was generated in 1989 [167]. The continued refinement and advancement of transgenic animals provides ever more possibilities for antibody drug development by global pharmaceutical factories\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - GEN\nTI  - Different influenza viruses cause epidemics ever year, and influenza vaccines are the most useful measure to prevent seasonal influenza. Single B cell isolation for the generation of potent and broadly neutralizing antiinfluenza antibodies has become a popular undertaking [234, 235]. MHAA4549A, a human mAb targeting the hemagglutinin stalk of influenza A virus was cloned from a single human plasmablast cell from an influenza virus vaccinated donor [236]. A Phase II clinical trial of MHAA4549A as a monotherapy for acute uncomplicated seasonal influenza A in otherwise healthy adults was recently completed (NCT02623322). CT P27, which contains two human mAbs (CT P22 and CT P23), was created by Celltrion and is in Phase II (NCT03511066). RG 6024, also named MHAB5553A, was generated by Genentech with a modified version of the single B cell isolation method [237]; it is currently under examination in Phase I (NCT02528903) trial. The Phase II trial for another antibody, TCN 032, was stopped in 2012 (NCT01719874)\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - GEN\nTI  - As a result of highly active development of antibody drugs in recent decades, mAbs have emerged among the major class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of many human diseases, especially cancers, immunological, infectious, neural and metabolic diseases. Sales growth and regulatory approval of mAb products were slow until the late 1990s when the first chimeric mAbs were approved (annual sales of $0.3 billion in 1997). With the subsequent approval of humanized and then fully human mAbs, the rate of product approvals and sales of mAb products has increased rapidly, with global sales revenue for all mAb products at $115.2 billion in 2018 (Fig. 1) [276]. The continued growth of mAb products in the coming years is expected to be a major driver of overall biopharmaceutical product sales\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - JOUR\nAU  - Kohler, G.\nAU  - Milstein, C.\nTI  - Continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity\nT2  - Nature\nPY  - 1975\nDA  - 1975\nVL  - 256\nSP  - 495\nEP  - 7\nLA  - \nER  - \n\nTY  - GEN\nAU  - Kaplon, H.\nAU  - Reichert, J.M.\nTI  - Antibodies to watch in 2019.

            "Here, we summarize five technical platforms that are related to the production of therapeutic antibodies, including chimeric antibodies, humanization, phage display, transgenic mice, and single B cell antibody technology (Fig. 3d). Phage display, transgenic mice, and single B cell antibody technology have proven to be reliable methods for the generation of human antibodies. As enormous storehouses of antibody encoding genes (> 1010) with unknown properties, high quality (antibody diversity) phage antibody libraries are critical to the successful identification of therapeutic mAbs. In addition, an optimal selection from phage display libraries is dependent on target antigen quality, antigen immobilization, and tight control of binding and wash conditions. Furthermore, careful prescreening design of conditions can tailor the characteristics of antibodies discovered from biopanning, including conformation specificity, epitope specificity, internalization, neutralization, and interspecies cross-reactivity. Currently, there are nine fully human antibodies that were discovered from phage libraries approved for therapy, and dozens more phage-derived antibody therapeutics are in clinical trials, waiting to enter the market [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c149\" href=\"#r149\">149</a>] (Table 5)."

        "Abstract": [
            "It has been more than three decades since the first monoclonal antibody was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986, and during this time, antibody engineering has dramatically evolved. Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation. Finally, future applications and perspectives are also discussed.",

In CDR grafting, non-human antibody CDR sequences are transplanted into a human framework sequence in order to maintain target specificity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] (Fig. 2c). The first humanized mAb approved by the US FDA in 1997 was the anti-IL-2 receptor, daclizumab, for the prevention of transplant rejection (Fig. 1) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].

            "The recent development of bispecific antibodies offers attractive new opportunities for the design of novel protein therapeutics. A bispecific antibody can be generated by utilizing protein engineering techniques to link two antigen binding domains (such as Fabs or scFvs), allowing a single antibody to simultaneously bind different antigens. Thus, bispecific antibodies may be engineered to exhibit novel functions, which do not exist in mixtures of the two parental antibodies. Most bispecific antibodies are designed to recruit cytotoxic effector cells of the immune system to target pathogenic cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. The first approved bispecific antibody was catumaxomab in Europe in 2009 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. Catumaxomab targets CD3 and EpCAM to treat solid tumors in patients with malignant ascites. However, this drug was withdrawn from the market in 2017 for commercial reasons. Currently, two bispecific antibodies have obtained US FDA approval and are on the market. First, blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) that targets CD3 and CD19 for treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>].

Important advances in antibody engineering made over the past decade have enhanced the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic antibodies.

Non-humanized murine mAbs have many disadvantages as treatments. For example, patients treated with mouse mAbs will produce a rapid human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response. HAMAs will not only hasten the clearance of mouse mAbs but may also produce undesirable allergic reactions and tumor penetration. Moreover, the ability of patients to initiate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in response to murine fragment crystallizable region (Fc) is limited. On the other hand, humanized mAbs are able to effectively exert effector functions while decreasing the immunogenicity of murine antibodies.",

CDR grafting is one of the most popular techniques in the production of humanized mAbs and was originally developed by Gregory P. Winter in 1986 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Using this technology, nonhuman CDR sequences are transplanted into human framework sequences, allowing the antibody to maintain the binding activity to the target antigen [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. The first US FDA approved CDR-grafted humanized mAb occurred in 1997 for daclizumab, which binds the IL-2 receptor and is used to prevent transplant rejection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Queen and collaborators [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>] developed daclizumab not only using CDR grafting, but also using the human framework that is maximally homologous to the murine framework, in order to decrease the loss of antigen recognition. In some cases, certain amino acids in the murine framework are crucial to maintain antibody binding activity. These residues may cooperate with CDRs to present an antibody paratope or directly interact with antigens. Currently, these crucial framework residues can be identified by observing the structure of antibodyantigen complex by X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and computer-aided protein homology modelling [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>]. The positions of amino acids in the framework may then be considered for restore by \u2018human back to mouse\u2019 mutations in CDR-grafted humanized antibodies, thereby improving the affinity and stability of the final product. Currently, web servers are being developed by integrated bioinformatics and antibody structure databases for rendering humanization experiments [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c76\" href=\"#r76\">76</a>]. They provide the tools for human template selection, grafting, back-mutation evaluation, and antibody modeling. However, if the binding activity of antibodies is still compromised, it should be further performed affinity maturation to improve this situation.",
            "Multiple methods have been developed to quantify the humanness of the variable region of mAbs. Abhinandan and Martin designed a tool called \u201cH-score\u201d to assess the \u201cdegree of humanness\u201d of antibody sequences, which calculates the mean sequence identity compared to a subset of human variable region sequences database [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>]. A germinality index was defined subsequent to assist germline humanization of a macaque antibody [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>]. G-score was derived from the H-score to improve classification of germline framework sequence [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c79\" href=\"#r79\">79</a>]. T20 score analyzer was established under a large database of ~ 38, 700 human antibody variable region sequences to clearly separate human sequences from mouse sequences and many other species as well [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>]. It was used to reveal similarities between humanized antibodies and fully human antibodies. These humanness score tools are available online and allow assisting the generation of humanized antibody [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>].",
            "The use of humanized antibodies has helped greatly to improve clinical tolerance of mAb therapeutics. Such intricate control over antibody sequences has opened the door to engineering mAbs for a wide range of possible applications in medicine. Currently, half of all mAbs used to treat humans are chimeric or humanized (Fig. 2, Table 1). One of the most well-known humanized antibodies is Trastuzumab (Herceptin), which was approved in 1998 and achieved annual sales of over $7 billion in 2018 (Table 2). Trastuzumab is used for the treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>].",
            "Immunogenicity of antibody-based therapeutics The use of mAbs in a clinical setting should have several essential biophysical properties, including high antigen binding activity, high stability, and low immunogenicity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>]. Antibody immunogenicity means the degree of the host immune system can recognize and react to these therapeutic agents. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) induced by the immune system can be found while immunogenicity occurring in patients administered with antibody drugs. Anti-drug antibodies have the potential to neutralize therapeutic agents, which can reduce the efficacy of the drugs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>]. Importantly, anti-drug antibodies may further cause adverse effects ranging from skin rashes to systemic inflammatory responses in the patients, which can impact both safety and efficacy of the antibody drugs in clinic use [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c83\" href=\"#r83\">83</a>]. Immunogenicity is influenced by several factors, such as drug dosage, administration strategy (route and combination), impurities contamination, aggregates arising from Ab/Ag binding complex, and structural features (sequence variation and glycosylation) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>].",
            "Humanized antibodies harbor human sequence in constant regions and nearly all human sequence in Fv, of which only CDRs are murine grafted. Antibodies of more human-like usually allow them to be higher tolerant and lower immunogenic in a clinical setting. For example, Perpetua et al showed a case to support this concept [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>]. They compared a humanized anti-CD52 antibody with its parental murine version and demonstrated humanization offers a significant reduction in immunogenicity. However, humanized antibodies retain murine CDRs which could be regarded as foreign antigens by host immune systems and eventually arise immunogenicity. For example, ADA was detected in 0.5% of women with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated with Trastuzumab during their therapeutic courses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>]. Recently, an immunogenicity analysis result from clinical data showed the ADA rates were 7.1% (21/ 296) in the HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with treatment of Trastuzumab [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>]. The variation of immunogenicity in the same antibody drug may be caused by many potential factors: the age, race, genetic background, other related diseases, and programs of drugs administration.",
            "The CDRs and frameworks of fully human antibodies are derived for human immunoglobulin gene repertoires, thus which can theoretically bypass immunogenicity. However, several fully human antibodies have been reported to induce marked immune responses when administrated in patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>]. Adalimumab (Humira), a human IgG1, has been reported to generate significant immune responses through eliciting anti-idiotypic antibody in a part of patients (5\u201389%) which varies depending on the disease and the therapy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>]. Golimumab (Simponi), a fully human anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody, combining with methotrexate for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis cause 16% of patients producing anti-drug antibodies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>]. One reason of these scenarios is that Fv sequence of human antibodies is not identical to human germline: antibody evolution through VJ and VDJ random recombination, as well as affinity maturation naturally occurring in vivo through somatic hypermutation. Until now, there are no in vitro or in-silico assays can precisely analyze the immunogenicity of antibody. In vivo assessments are usually used to evaluate the immunogenicity, of which the result will ameliorate design and engineering of antibody therapeutics to reduce the potential for inducing anti-drug antibodies.",
            "Generation of human antibodies by phage display Overview of antibody phage libraries Phage display is the first and still the most widely used technology for in vitro antibody selection. The strategy was developed based on the excellent work of George P. Smith in 1985 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], who used recombinant DNA techniques to fuse foreign peptides with a coat protein (pIII) of bacteriophage M13 in order to display peptides on the bacteriophage surface. He then created \u201cantibody-selectable phage vectors\u201d and described an in vitro method that enabled affinity selection of antigen-specific phagedisplayed antibodies from 108-fold excess phage pools [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>]. It was later discovered that scFv, small antibody formats, can be expressed on phage filaments. At the time, there were three different research institutions independently establishing phage-displayed scFv or Fab antibody libraries: the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the UK [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>], the German Cancer",
            "Research Center in Germany [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>], and Scripps Research Institute in the USA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c96\" href=\"#r96\">96</a>]. Since then, these phagedisplayed antibody libraries have proven to be a reliable discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human mAbs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>].",
            "The process of identifying mAbs from a phagedisplayed library begins with antibody-library construction (Fig. 4a). The variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, representing the Ig gene-encoding repertoire, are ligated into a phage display vector (phagemid). High quality mRNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The different VH and VL chain-region gene families are then amplified using specific primers to amplify all transcribed variable regions within the Ig repertoire [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c98\" href=\"#r98\">98</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c99\" href=\"#r99\">99</a>]. The format of antibodies in a phage-displayed library can be either scFv or Fab fragments (Fig. 4b); scFvs are composed of the VH and VL domain connected by a short flexible linker. Antibody Fab fragments displayed on the phage coat protein have comparably higher structural stability and can be readily converted to intact IgG antibodies, usually without impairing binding activity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c100\" href=\"#r100\">100</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c101\" href=\"#r101\">101</a>]. The elegance of phage-displayed libraries is apparent in the linkage between antibody phenotype (specificity and sensitivity) and genotype (genetic information) via the phage particle. Due to the small size and high solubility (1013 particles/ml) of phage particles, repertoire sizes up to 1011 independent clones can be efficiently produced and displayed in a single library [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c102\" href=\"#r102\">102</a>\u2013 <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c104\" href=\"#r104\">104</a>].",
            "Gene repertoires for phage display libraries can be obtained from na\u00efve or immunized animals, or the libraries may be synthetically constructed using randomized CDR",
            "Currently, almost all widely accessible commercial libraries are based on highly diverse non-immunized gene repertoires, which allow selection of antibodies against a virtually unlimited number of targets [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c108\" href=\"#r108\">108</a>]. It is worth noting that most antibody drugs that have undergone evaluation in clinical trials originated from a few company-owned libraries. These libraries include: Cambridge Antibody Technology\u2019s (now MedImmune, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca) scFv-fragment library, Dyax Corp\u2019s (now Shire) human Fab-fragment libraries, scFv and Fab libraries from XOMA, and the fully synthetic human combinatorial antibody scFv (HuCAL) and Fab (HuCALGold) libraries developed by MorphoSys [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>].",
            "Affinity selection of human antibodies Antibody libraries are typically screened by iterative selection cycles to enrich target-binding phages, followed by amplification of the bound phages in E. coli cells. The affinity screening process for antibody libraries is called biopanning (Fig. 4c). Repeated rounds of selection allow for the enrichment of very rare antigen-binding phage clones, eventually resulting in the selection of the most highly specific binders. This stringent process is a critical feature of phage display that allows mAbs to be isolated in a period as short as a couple of weeks, far more quickly than the traditional hybridoma method [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c99\" href=\"#r99\">99</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c109\" href=\"#r109\">109</a>]. For in vitro selection, it is necessary to immobilize target antigens on a solid surface. Polystyrene surfaces with high protein binding capacity, such as 96-well immuno-plates and immuno-tubes, are widely used for antigen immobilization. Additionally, magnetic beads with protein G/A, streptavidin, maleimide or N-",
            "hydroxysuccinimide can be used to immobilize antigens and perform biopanning in solution.",
            "The biopanning method is not only restricted to known recombinant proteins. In fact, the phage display technique may also be utilized to select antibodies against whole cells, unveiling previously unknown antigens on the tumor cell surface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c110\" href=\"#r110\">110</a>]. Cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease, and only a few tumor cells with stem-like properties are able to initiate and sustain tumor development; these cells are often referred as tumor initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c111\" href=\"#r111\">111</a>]. Phage display technology is well suited for applications in CSC research, and several antibodies have already been identified from phage display libraries for their ability to bind known CSC markers, such as CD133 and CD44 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c112\" href=\"#r112\">112</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c113\" href=\"#r113\">113</a>]. Moreover, novel CSC surface markers may be identified by selecting phage-displayed antibodies that bind to a CSC-like population and then identifying the corresponding target antigens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c114\" href=\"#r114\">114</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c115\" href=\"#r115\">115</a>]. The use of tumor biopsy tissue as a biological material allows researchers to probe the tumor microenvironment, which may be highly relevant for clinical use. Phage display technology has been used to probe cancer tissue biopsies in order to generate antibody fragments that specifically recognize tumor subpopulations, such as CSCs and tumor-associated endothelial cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c116\" href=\"#r116\">116</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c118\" href=\"#r118\">118</a>] as well as other clinically relevant tumor antigens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c119\" href=\"#r119\">119</a>].",
            "Antibodies or antibody fragments have been referred to as targeted drug delivery \u201cmissiles\u201d for their ability to direct homing of drugs to tumors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c120\" href=\"#r120\">120</a>]. For example, immunoliposomes have been demonstrated to provide conventional liposomal drugs with cancer targeting ability, which can increase the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c121\" href=\"#r121\">121</a>]. Cellular internalization of the targeting ligand is an essential outcome for successful tumor-targeted liposomal drug delivery [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c99\" href=\"#r99\">99</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c122\" href=\"#r122\">122</a>]. For this reason, an efficient phage display-based selection approach was designed to map tumor internalizing epitopes, wherein a phage-displayed library was incubated with living cancer cells at 37 \u00b0C [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c123\" href=\"#r123\">123</a>]. This method was successfully applied to rapidly identify several scFvs with high rates of internalization in several types of tumors; the target antigens were subsequently identified, and intracellular drug delivery systems were further developed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c99\" href=\"#r99\">99</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c124\" href=\"#r124\">124</a>].",
            "The identification of mAbs with phage display is an entirely in vitro process. Thus, it is not restricted by immunological tolerance, allowing for the identification of antibodies against poorly immunogenic antigens or those that are difficult to obtain using animal immunization methods (e.g., glycans or toxic agents). The in vitro nature of the assay can be especially useful when identifying specific antibodies against novel or gene-mutated pathogens in an outbreak of emergent infectious diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c125\" href=\"#r125\">125</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c127\" href=\"#r127\">127</a>]. The antigens on pathogens usually induce a strong immune response in patients, making it common for infected individuals to naturally produce high-affinity antibodies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c128\" href=\"#r128\">128</a>]. To obtain these antibodies, mRNA from the PBMCs of pathogeninfected people can be quickly collected and used as a gene repertoire for a phage-displayed library [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c129\" href=\"#r129\">129</a>]. Such a library can allow for the rapid identification of highaffinity antibodies that may then be used as guides for vaccine design, or to develop therapeutic drugs and diagnostic reagents.",
            "Moreover, the biopanning approach has been modified to isolate and identify a few antibodies with broad neutralizing activity against pandemic influenza virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c130\" href=\"#r130\">130</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c131\" href=\"#r131\">131</a>]. Chen et al reported the establishment of a phagedisplayed Fab library derived from the PBMCs of convalescent patients infected with a novel influenza A virus H7N9, which broke out in 2013. Using this library, antibodies targeting purified H7N9 virions were isolated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c132\" href=\"#r132\">132</a>]. Two human antibodies were found to exhibit high neutralizing activity against live H7N9 virus due to their interactions with the receptor-binding site of viral hemagglutinin antigens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c132\" href=\"#r132\">132</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c133\" href=\"#r133\">133</a>].",

There are nine phage display-derived human antibodies currently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of human disease (Table 1), demonstrating the reliability of this technique as a platform for antibody discovery.",
            "Adalimumab (Humira) was developed by BASF Bioresearch Corporation and Cambridge Antibody Technology. It was not only the first phage display-derived antibody granted a marketing approval, but adalimubab was also the first approved (2002) fully human mAb drug [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c139\" href=\"#r139\">139</a>]. Adalimumab binds and suppresses TNF\u03b1 and is approved to treat inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and psoriasis.

These characteristics make the receptors potentially valuable targets for drug development. Necitumumab (Portrazza) is an anti-EGFR human antibody that was identified by screening high EGFR-expressing epidermal carcinoma cells (A431) with a non-immunized phage Fab library of 3.7 \u00d7 1010 clones [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c105\" href=\"#r105\">105</a>].

VEGFR2 is not only highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells, where it regulates tumor angiogenesis, but it also expressed on the surface of cancer cells.

Compared with other technologies for human antibody production, transgenic animals have several advantages, i.e., no need for humanization, more diversity, in vivo affinity maturation and clonal selection for antibody optimization. However, the large size of human Ig loci was a challenge during the development of transgenic mouse antibody technology. Additionally, the production of repertoires in transgenic mice that are similar or comparable those in humans requires diverse rearrangements combined with high expression of human V, D, and J segments [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c162\" href=\"#r162\">162</a>]. To overcome these major challenges, different strategies have been successfully used to generate animals expressing human antibody repertoires (Table 4) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c165\" href=\"#r165\">165</a>].",

            "03/21/ 02/06/ 2002 2021 provided a new direction for the development of human antibody production. In 1989, Br\u00fcggemann et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c167\" href=\"#r167\">167</a>] cloned the first human heavy chain construct, containing two human VH genes, for diversity segments (D) linked to the human heavy chain joining cluster (JH), and the \u03bc constant region. The 25 kb construct was micro-injected as a mililocus plasmid into fertilized murine eggs, allowing its random insertion into the murine genome. About 4% of B lymphocytes expressed human \u03bc chain at detectable levels in these transgenic mice.

            "Blue: human sequence, Green: mouse sequence aThe number of human heavy chain variable region bThe number of human kappa chain variable region hybridomas of human IgM antibody could also be established using this transgenic strain. In 1992, Taylor et al cloned the human \u03ba light chain [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c168\" href=\"#r168\">168</a>] construct, containing one human kappa light chain variable (V\u03ba) gene, the human kappa light chain joining cluster (J\u03ba) and kappa constant region (C\u03ba). While the mice expressed the human heavy chain (VH-D-JH-C\u03bc-C\u03b31) and the human kappa light chain, the amount of human antibody was less than 10% of total antibodies, so the expression of human antibodies was not compatible with expression of mouse endogenous Ig [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c168\" href=\"#r168\">168</a>].",
            "At a similar time, various murine Ig knockout mouse strains were generated. In 1993, Chen et al knocked out murine JH and J\u03ba genes with gene targeted deletion, inactivating mouse Ig [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c169\" href=\"#r169\">169</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c170\" href=\"#r170\">170</a>]. The human IgH and IgL transgenic mice were then crossed with murine IgH and IgL knockout mice in an attempt to create lines that could generate more diverse human antibodies. In 1994, the first human Ig -transgenic mice strain, HuMabMouse [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>], was generated by Longberg et al In this line, human IgH and Ig\u039a are expressed in murine IgH and Ig\u039a deficient mice. The entire human IgH genome is about 1.29 Mb and Ig\u039a is about 1.39 Mb, but the human Ig genome introduced into mice was less than 80 kb [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Since antibody diversity comes from germline V(D) J genes, it is reasonable that the introduction of more human variable genes will lead to more diversity of generated antibodies.",
            "Likewise, Davies et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c171\" href=\"#r171\">171</a>] and Choi et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c172\" href=\"#r172\">172</a>] used yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors in 1993 to respectively construct human Ig\u039a (~ 300 kb) and IgH (~ 85 kb) genes via yeast homologous recombination. In 1994, Green et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] constructed human Ig\u039a (~ 170 kb) and IgH (~ 220 kb) genome YACs and successfully introduced them into mouse embryonic stem cells by yeast spheroplast-ES cell fusion. Furthermore, in 1997, Mendez et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] introduced a larger human Ig\u039a (~ 700 Kb) or IgH (~ 1 Mb) YAC into mouse ES cells, crossing the human Ig mice with murine IgH and IgL knockout mice to generate XenoMouse [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c131\" href=\"#r131\">131</a>]. As expected, the XenoMouse only express human antibodies rather than mouse antibodies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c173\" href=\"#r173\">173</a>]. While the development of this line has eliminated the interference from mouse endogenous Ig and expanded the human Ig genes, the efficiency of human antibody generation, Ig class-switching and somatic hypermutation still remain low, due to a lack of mouse constant region gene expression [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c158\" href=\"#r158\">158</a>].",
            "Chimeric human antibody mice In order to overcome the drawbacks of a fully human heavy chain antibody, it is necessary to retain the original murine constant region. If a chimeric antibody with human Fab and murine Fc can be generated in mouse, the murine Fc would modulate the signaling for somatic hypermutation during antibody affinity maturation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c158\" href=\"#r158\">158</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c174\" href=\"#r174\">174</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c175\" href=\"#r175\">175</a>] and effector function of antibodies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c174\" href=\"#r174\">174</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c176\" href=\"#r176\">176</a>]. Along these lines, Osborn et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c163\" href=\"#r163\">163</a>] linked human VH, D, and JH genes to the rat constant region locus in 2013. The large segments of human IgH and IgL were subcloned and linked by bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and YAC techniques, followed by micro-injection of the minilocus plasmid into fertilized rat oocytes. Meanwhile, endogenous rat Ig loci were silenced with a zinc finger nuclease. The resulting rat strain (OmniRat) chimeric human exhibits antibody production, antigen affinity and somatic mutations similar to wild-type rats. In 2014, Lee et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c164\" href=\"#r164\">164</a>] utilized BACs with Cre/loxP recombination in mouse ES cells to generate a mouse strain with human VH-D-JH and V\u03ba-J\u03ba inserted directly upstream of murine C\u03bc and C\u03ba regions (KyMouse). After antigen immunization, the KyMouse can process somatic hypermutation and produce highaffinity chimeric human antibodies. In another effort, Murphy et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c165\" href=\"#r165\">165</a>] used BACs to assemble large human Ig genes and serially micro-injected the constructs into mouse ES cells. The human IgH and IgL genes targeted and replaced the murine IgH and IgL, upstream of the constant region (VelocImmune mouse).",

This drug was approved for severe plaque psoriasis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] in 2009 and for Crohn\u2019s disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c192\" href=\"#r192\">192</a>] in 2016.",

Sarilumab (Kevzara, Sanofi and Regeneron, human IgG1) inhibits IL-6 signaling by binding to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which otherwise would upregulate the release of rheumatoid arthritis-related factors from hepatocytes.

            "Single B cell antibody technology In the human immune system, antibody responses are robust, highly specific, neutralizing and self-tolerant. Producing therapeutic human antibodies using the traditional hybridoma technique or transgenic mice requires long-term immunization procedures and screening, while the clinical use of murine antibodies may trigger severe immunogenic responses (such as HAMA) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c194\" href=\"#r194\">194</a>]. To avoid these obstacles, a technique for immortalizing human B cells with Epstein-Barr virus was developed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c195\" href=\"#r195\">195</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c197\" href=\"#r197\">197</a>].

Thus, in emergent cases such as infectious diseases, single B cell antibody technologies have the major advantage of requiring only a few cells, allowing the highly efficient and rapid isolation of potential mAbs. Moreover, single B cell cloning preserves the biologically mediated heavy chain and light chain pairing, instead of the random pairing that is characteristic of mAbs from phage display antibody libraries. These randomly paired mAbs occasionally lose binding affinity or develop self-reactivity when transferred from scFv to intact IgG formats.",

Generally, mononuclear cells are purified from PBMCs or bone marrow by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Based on B cell expression of specific cell surface markers in different stages, isolation of single B cells by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting is widely utilized, especially in the identification of rare and discrete B cell subpopulations. Antigen-coated magnetic beads [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c203\" href=\"#r203\">203</a>] and fluorescenceconjugated antigens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c204\" href=\"#r204\">204</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c206\" href=\"#r206\">206</a>] are also often used to select antigen-specific B cells in a process known as antigen baiting. Neutralizing human mAbs against Puumala virus were generated from B cells isolated using antigencoated magnetic beads [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c207\" href=\"#r207\">207</a>]. Recently, antigenconjugated fluorescent beads have been used to identify antigen-specific B cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c208\" href=\"#r208\">208</a>]. Fluorescent virus-like particles of rotavirus served as antigen bait for single RVspecific B cells, which had been extracted from healthy rotavirus-infected infants or adult donors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c209\" href=\"#r209\">209</a>].

This step involves the use of nested or semi-nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for amplification of the variable heavy and light chain of each identified B cell. Usually, forward primers are directed toward IgH and IgL variable leader sequences and reverse primers are complementary to the Ig constant region [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c201\" href=\"#r201\">201</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c214\" href=\"#r214\">214</a>].

The microengraving method depends on the use of a soft lithographic technique to generate microarrays comprising the secreted antibodies of single cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c217\" href=\"#r217\">217</a>].

            "Profiling of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibody repertoires from the memory B cells of naturally infected adults [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c238\" href=\"#r238\">238</a>] or generation of neutralizing antibodies from RSV-infected infants [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c239\" href=\"#r239\">239</a>] has been undertaken as well. MEDI8897, an anti-RSV antibody developed by MedImmune, is currently being evaluated for safety and efficacy in Phase II clinical trial (NCT02878330).",
            "Over the past decade, generation of mAbs by single B cell technology has become increasingly attractive. However, there are still no US FDA-approved therapeutic mAbs developed by this method that is used for clinical treatment of any disease. Although single B cell technology possesses several irreplaceable advantages, there are still challenges to be overcome. For example, the antigen labeling technique, the configuration of sorting antigens (e.g., monomer or dimer) and the design of primer sets are all important considerations for successful generation of mAbs. In the future, recovery of mAbs from single B cell platforms may be a powerful tool in combination with next generation sequencing for development of novel diagnostics, pharmacokinetic applications, and clinical therapeutics.",
            "Affinity maturation of antibodies Antibodies identified from humanized, phage or transgenic methods are often further engineered, including the replacement of residues with binding liabilities in the binding region. In addition, point mutations in the antibody structure sometimes result in products with weaker antigen interactions than the original antibody (low affinity), but some mutations will result in stronger interactions (high affinity). The process of enhancing affinity for antigens is called affinity maturation. After V(D) J recombination, affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells with the help from helper T cells.",
            "Affinity maturation is an important characteristic of the humoral immune response, which can result in antibodies with low picomolar affinity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c240\" href=\"#r240\">240</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c241\" href=\"#r241\">241</a>]. High affinity is a crucial attribute of antibodies for the neutralization of cytokines or growth factor-induced signaling. Generally, for a mAb to be considered for therapeutic drug development, it should have an affinity of 1 nM or less for the target antigen [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c242\" href=\"#r242\">242</a>]. Moreover, humanization of mouse mAbs frequently reduces affinity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c243\" href=\"#r243\">243</a>]. Thus, the use of affinity maturation is often a necessary step in antibody drug development [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c244\" href=\"#r244\">244</a>].",
            "Approaches for affinity maturation Phage display and yeast display have been widely used for affinity maturation of antibodies, due to their amenability to easily screen for high affinity variants and to high throughput applications [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>]. Methods for increasing antibody affinity can be broadly divided into two broad categories. The first is to generate a large randomly mutated library of CDR or entire variable domain sequences, followed by a selection of higher affinity variants from this large number of mutants. Another approach is to prepare small libraries by focused mutagenesis or hotspot mutagenesis that mimics in vivo affinity maturation. In this focused method, a high affinity variant is selected to be randomized at individual positions in each of the six CDRs or at a discrete point in the variable domain called the hotspot. The usual practice is to combine different mutations, resulting in small increases in affinity. The combination of these different mutations may have an additive or synergistic effect that can result in substantial increases in the affinity of the antibody to the antigen [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c245\" href=\"#r245\">245</a>]. Phage display technology can be employed to identify high affinity antibodies in an antibody gene mutation library under stringent biopanning conditions, including decreased antigen amount, extended incubation and intensive washing steps or by competition with soluble antigen [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c104\" href=\"#r104\">104</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c246\" href=\"#r246\">246</a>]. Using phage display with VH and VL CDR3 mutation libraries, the affinity of anti-HER2 antibody was improved more than 1200-fold [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>].",
            "Diversification of antibody genes is the initial step of affinity maturation in vitro, and this step may be achieved using various strategies, such as random mutations, targeted mutations or chain shuffling [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c246\" href=\"#r246\">246</a>]. Mutations can be randomly introduced into the variable regions of antibody genes by error-prone PCR in mutator E. coli strains [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c247\" href=\"#r247\">247</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c248\" href=\"#r248\">248</a>]. Chain shuffling approaches are those in which one of two chains, VH and VL, is fixed and recombined with a repertoire of partner chains to produce a next-generation library [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c249\" href=\"#r249\">249</a>]. Moreover, mutations can be introduced to particular regions of the antibody gene. This type of targeting mutation approach was employed to diversify CDR residues and was shown to be effective in ameliorating the affinity of antibodies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c250\" href=\"#r250\">250</a>]. Therefore, this method is more relevant to in vivo somatic mutations during B cell evolution because mutations accumulate more efficiently in the CDR than framework residues.",
            "Future perspectives The field of therapeutic antibodies has undergone rapid growth in recent years, becoming a dominant force in the therapeutics market. However, there is still significant growth potential for the therapeutic antibody field. Traditionally, antibodies have been used for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. If the molecular mechanisms of a specific disease can be clearly elucidated and the specific proteins or molecules involved in pathogenesis can be identified, antibodies may provide an effective therapeutic option. For example, anti-CGRP receptor antibodies (erenumab, galcanezumab, or fremanezumab) have been developed for the prevention of migraine. Anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibodies (evolocumab or alirocumab) are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Anti-fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) antibody (burosumab) is used to treat X-linked hypophosphatemia. Anti-IL6R antibody (sarilumab and tocilizumab) can be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-Factor IXa/Xa antibody (emicizumab) is a valuable treatment for hemophilia A. Anti-von Willebrand factor antibody (caplacizumab) is approved for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and other antibodies will be approved for new indications in the near future.",
            "Therapeutic antibodies can roughly be separated into two broad categories (Fig. 5). In the first category, the naked antibody is directly used for disease therapy. Cancer treatments from this category may act through several different mechanisms, including mediated pathways (e.g., ADCC/CDC), direct targeting of cancer cells to induce apoptosis, targeting the tumor microenvironment, or targeting immune checkpoints. In mediated pathways, the antibody kills cancer cells by recruiting natural killer",
            "In the second category of antibody drugs, additional modifications are made to the antibody in order to enhance its therapeutic value. Some general approaches include immunocytokines, antibody-drug conjugate, antibody-radionuclide conjugates, bispecific antibodies, immunoliposomes, and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy. To create an immunocytokine, a selected cytokine is fused to an antibody to enhance delivery specificity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c259\" href=\"#r259\">259</a>]. Antibody drug conjugates consist of an antibody that targets a cancer-specific marker conjugated to the small molecule drug; the antibody enhances delivery to the tumor site, increasing the efficacy of the small molecule while reducing side effects by reducing non-specific toxicity to non-target tissues [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c260\" href=\"#r260\">260</a>]. The antibody may also be conjugated to a radionuclide, in order to direct radiotherapy more specifically to the tumor site [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c261\" href=\"#r261\">261</a>]. For bispecific antibodies, antibodies targeting two receptors are engineered to further enhance therapeutic effects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c262\" href=\"#r262\">262</a>]. Antibody-engaged effector cell functions may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of bispecific antibodies. With regard to immunoliposomes, the binding site of the antibody (scFv or Fab) is cleaved from the constant region and subsequently conjugated to different nano-drug delivery systems, such as liposomal drugs, to provide more specific targeting [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c263\" href=\"#r263\">263</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c264\" href=\"#r264\">264</a>]. Lastly, CAR-T involves inserting the gene for a chimeric T cell receptor-antibody targeting a specific cancer marker into T cells, such that the engineered cells target and kill cancer cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c265\" href=\"#r265\">265</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c266\" href=\"#r266\">266</a>]. In recent years, this approach has garnered major attention from the scientific and medical community due to its significant clinical benefits to cancer patients. In many cases, patients have experienced complete remission or even been completely cured of cancer [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c267\" href=\"#r267\">267</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c271\" href=\"#r271\">271</a>].",
            "Although new methods have been well-established for generating fully human antibodies, such as human antibody transgenic mice and human single B cell antibody techniques, phage display still has advantages as an antibody drug discovery platform, based on its efficient and economical in vitro selection methodology. Recently, some advanced techniques have been applied in antibody discovery, including high-throughput robotic screening [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c272\" href=\"#r272\">272</a>], next generation sequencing [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c273\" href=\"#r273\">273</a>] and single cell sequencing [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c274\" href=\"#r274\">274</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c275\" href=\"#r275\">275</a>]. These techniques are expected to greatly accelerate the identification of specific phage binders, facilitating mAb development for use in research, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceuticals for the treatment of human disease.",
            "By reviewing currently approved mAbs, one may easily see how sophisticated formats were developed in response to challenges posed by therapeutic indications. These mAb engineering solutions are highlighted by antibody-drug conjugates, glycoengineered mAbs, immunomodulators, bispecific mAbs, and CAR-T cells."
        ],
        "Conclusions": [
            "Here, we summarize five technical platforms that are related to the production of therapeutic antibodies, including chimeric antibodies, humanization, phage display, transgenic mice, and single B cell antibody technology (Fig. 3d). Phage display, transgenic mice, and single B cell antibody technology have proven to be reliable methods for the generation of human antibodies. As enormous storehouses of antibody encoding genes (> 1010) with unknown properties, high quality (antibody diversity) phage antibody libraries are critical to the successful identification of therapeutic mAbs. In addition, an optimal selection from phage display libraries is dependent on target antigen quality, antigen immobilization, and tight control of binding and wash conditions. Furthermore, careful prescreening design of conditions can tailor the characteristics of antibodies discovered from biopanning, including conformation specificity, epitope specificity, internalization, neutralization, and interspecies cross-reactivity. Currently, there are nine fully human antibodies that were discovered from phage libraries approved for therapy, and dozens more phage-derived antibody therapeutics are in clinical trials, waiting to enter the market [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c149\" href=\"#r149\">149</a>] (Table 5).",
            "In order to improve the quality of antibody drugs, researchers have developed several transgenic animals, including fully human mice and second-generation human chimeric mouse. The continued refinement and advancement of transgenic animals provide more options for antibody drug development in global pharmaceutical factories. All the transgenic-derived mAbs approved for therapeutic use have come from from three companies: Abgenix (XenoMouse) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>], Medarex (HuMAbMouse) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>], and Regeneron (VelocImmune) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c165\" href=\"#r165\">165</a>]. Depending on the immunization protocol, high affinity human antibodies can be obtained through selection of the clones generated in the animals. This selection is mainly accomplished by hybridoma technology. Currently, there are 19 approved human mAbs that were discovered from these three transgenic animals (Table 5).",
            "Over the past decade, generation of mAbs from isolated single B cells has become an increasingly attractive approach. To date, no US FDA-approved therapeutic mAbs have been derived from this method; however, it possesses several major advantages, and ongoing challenges are currently being solved. The success of the method relies heavily on the antigen labeling technique, the configuration of sorting antigens (e.g., monomer or dimer) and the set of primers used for amplification. In the future, the recovery of mAbs from single B cells is expected to become a powerful tool in combination with next generation sequencing for diagnostics, pharmacokinetic application, and clinical therapeutics.",
            "As a result of highly active development of antibody drugs in recent decades, mAbs have emerged among the major class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of many human diseases, especially cancers, immunological, infectious, neural and metabolic diseases. Sales growth and regulatory approval of mAb products were slow until the late 1990s when the first chimeric mAbs were approved (annual sales of $0.3 billion in 1997). With the subsequent approval of humanized and then fully human mAbs, the rate of product approvals and sales of mAb products has increased rapidly, with global sales revenue for all mAb products at $115.2 billion in 2018 (Fig. 1) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c276\" href=\"#r276\">276</a>]. The continued growth of mAb products in the coming years is expected to be a major driver of overall biopharmaceutical product sales.",
