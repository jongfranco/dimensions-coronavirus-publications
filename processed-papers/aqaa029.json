Coronaviruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, single-stranded, positivesense RNA viruses that have a characteristic appearance on electron microscopy negative staining \u275aImage 1\u275a. As a matter of fact, the characteristic electron microscopy appearance was the clue to amplify and sequence nucleic acids from Dr Urbani\u2019s (one of the health care providers who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] in 2003) respiratory specimen using a consensus coronavirus primer.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] The sequence of the virus was significantly different from other coronaviruses known to cause human disease at the time. The virus was ultimately named SARS-CoV, as febrile patients had severe acute respiratory syndrome and could present with pneumonia and lower respiratory symptoms such as cough and dyspnea.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] The SARS-CoV outbreak started in Guangdong, China, and spread to many countries in Southeast Asia, North America, Europe, and South Africa. Transmission was primarily person to person through droplets that occurred during coughing or sneezing, through personal contact (shaking hands), or by touching contaminated surfaces. Of note, health professionals were particularly at risk of acquiring the disease, as transmission also occurred if isolation precautions were not followed and during certain procedures. The last case of SARS-CoV occurred in September 2003, after having infected over 8,000 persons and causing 774 deaths with a case fatality rate calculated at 9.5%.",

            "Nine years later, a new coronavirus that causes respiratory disease appeared in the Middle East, thus the name of MERS-CoV. Symptoms of MERS-CoV are nonspecific, but many patients end up with severe acute respiratory distress. In these patients, travel history is imperative, as all cases have been linked to persons in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Similar to SARS-CoV, health professionals are at higher risk of acquiring the disease, as demonstrated in the outbreak in South Korea.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] However, in comparison with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is still circulating, and the case fatality rate is much higher (around 35%). What has allowed control of MERS-CoV is a low R (approximately 1), meaning each person with the disease transmits it to only one other person (the SARSCoV R was of approximately 4)."
