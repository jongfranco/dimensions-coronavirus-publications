        "abstract": "A novel Coronavirus, 2019\u2010nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December 2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very recently Italy. In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV plus two closely related bat strains (SARS\u2010like CoV) available in GenBank. Bayesian time\u2010scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that 2019\u20102020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25 November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy, and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.",

In the globalization era characterized by high human mobility, this report suggests that the spread of a new epidemic is favored, rapidly reaching other countries even in other continents as we observed during the last days.

The root\u2010to\u2010tip vs divergence plot of the full dataset showed high correlation between sampling time and genetic distance to the root of the ML tree of the available sequences (R2, .60), coherently with substantial temporal signal and the possibility to calibrate a reliable molecular clock, despite availability of relative small number of sequences and short sampling interval time.<br/><br/>Bayesian model selection chose the Bayesian skyline demographic model with an uncorrelated relaxed clock like the one best fitting the data. Molecular clock calibration estimated the evolutionary rate of the 2019\u2010nCoV whole\u2010genome sequences at 6.58 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions site per year (95% HPD 5.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 8.1 \u00d7 10\u22123).<br/><br/>In Figure 1, the MCC tree with Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction of 2019\u2010nCoV isolates up to day is shown.

The root\u2010to\u2010tip vs divergence plot of the full dataset showed high correlation between sampling time and genetic distance to the root of the ML tree of the available sequences (R2, .60), coherently with substantial temporal signal and the possibility to calibrate a reliable molecular clock, despite availability of relative small number of sequences and short sampling interval time.",

        "Introduction": [
            "An ongoing epidemic by a new Coronavirus, named 2019\u2010nCoV, starting in late 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei region, China, is a worldwide public health concern.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2010<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] The virus probably originated from bat after mutation in the spike glycoprotein, as recently suggested, acquired the ability to infect humans, which started the new epidemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>].",
            "In Italy, two cases have been registered in Rome, in a couple of Chinese tourists hosted in a Hotel placed in the center of the city.",
            "The Chinese tourists had arrived in Milan on 23 January 2020 from Wuhan, and thereafter they traveled to Rome."
        ],
        "Methods": [
            "By IQ\u2010TREE 1.6.8 software the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny was reconstructed under the HKY nucleotide substitution model with 4 gamma categories (HKY+G4) which were inferred in jModelTest as the best fitting model.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
            "The HKY+G4 codon partitioned 1 + 2,3 substitution model and the Bayesian skyline coalescent model of population size and growth was implemented.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) duplicate runs of 100 million states each, sampling every 10 000 steps was computed.",
            "The maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were obtained from the tree posterior distribution using TreeAnnotator after 10% burn\u2010in"
        ],
        "Results": [
            "The viral genomes analyzed from the dataset, despite being isolated in a short time, already exhibited a substantial degree of heterogeneity with differences in 15% of the sites, 11% of which were parsimony informative.",
            "These data are coherent with the presence of sufficient phylogenetic signal for phylogenetic inference, in agreement with the low level of phylogenetic noise shown by likelihood mapping (<7%).",
            "The strains from the Chinese tourist dated back to 19 January 2020 (95% HPD: 18 January 2020; \u201c1 January 2020\u201d; Figure 1)"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "The early sharing of data about the Coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic is fundamental to better understand the transmission dynamics of this virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].",
