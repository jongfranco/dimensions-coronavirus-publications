        "abstract": "The 2019-nCoV outbreak has become a global health risk. Editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against coronaviruses. Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from two Wuhan patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals patterns similar to the RNA editing pattern observed in the 2019-nCoV transcriptomes. Our results suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in Coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.",

This is compatible with the presence in the cell, during replication, of both positive and negative strands of the viral genome.

To understand whether A-to-I editing is an effective path of restriction of 2019-nCoV, it will be necessary to assess if a substantial fraction of viral transcripts is hyper-edited [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] or fail to be packaged into virions.",

For DNA viruses, the selection is indirect, as genomes evolve to reduce potentially harmful editable sites (e.g. 12), but for RNA viruses this pressure is even stronger, as RNA editing directly effects the genetic information and efficiently edited sites disappear.",
            "Finally, this analysis is a first step in understanding the involvement of RNA editing in viral replication, and it could lead to clinically relevant outcomes: (a) if these enzymes are relevant in the host response to Coronavirus infection, a polymorphism quite common in the Chinese population that inactivates APOBEC3A [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>] could play a role in the spread of the infection.",
