        "abstract": "An increasing number of insect-specific viruses are found around the world. Very recently, a new group of insect-specific viruses, the Mesoniviridae family, was discovered in Africa, Asia, North America and Australia. Here we report the first detection and isolation of a new virus belonging to Mesonivirus genus in Senegal, West Africa. The so-called Dianke virus was detected in 21 species of arthropods trapped in the eastern part of the country. Male individuals were also infected, supporting vertical transmission assertion of insect specific viruses. As described for other mesoniviruses, no viral replication was observed after inoculation of mammalian cells. Viral replication in mosquito cells was blocked at a temperature of 37 \u00b0C, highlighting the importance of thermal conditions in Mesonivirus host restriction. Similar to our study, where a diverse range of arthropod vectors were found infected by the new virus, several studies have detected mesonivirus infection in mosquitoes with concerns for human health. It has been shown that dual infections in mosquito can alter viral infectivity. Due to their extensive geographic distribution and host range, as well as their use as potential disease control agents in vector populations, more studies should be done for a better knowledge of arthropod-restricted viruses prevalence and diversity.",
