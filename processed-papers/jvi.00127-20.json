        "abstract": "Recently a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing symptoms in humans similar to those caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV, and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.\nSignificance\nThe recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.",

            "A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, China has recently caused over confirmed cases of human infections and at least 17 deaths in China (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019.html). There are also numerous confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections in other countries including USA.<br/><br/>Many of the symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV, such as acute respiratory syndrome, are similar to those caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV emerged in<br/><br/>2002-2003 and transmitted among humans, causing over 8000 confirmed cases of human infections and about 800 deaths (1-4). It briefly re-emerged in 2003-2004, with 4 confirmed cases of mild human infections and no human-to-human transmission (5-7).<br/><br/>SARS-CoV has also been isolated from animals and been adapted to lab cell culture (5, 8-11). It is believed that bats and palm civets were the natural and intermediate reservoirs for SARS-CoV, respectively, and that SARS-CV transmitted from palm civets to humans in an animal market in Southern China (12-14). It has been reported that 2019-nCoV also infected humans in an animal market in Wuhan, although the animal source of the outbreak is currently unknown. Moreover, it has been confirmed that 2019-nCoV has the capacity to transmit from human to human."

Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV, and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.",

            "A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, China has recently caused over confirmed cases of human infections and at least 17 deaths in China (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019.html). There are also numerous confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections in other countries including USA.",
            "Many of the symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV, such as acute respiratory syndrome, are similar to those caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV emerged in",
            "2002-2003 and transmitted among humans, causing over 8000 confirmed cases of human infections and about 800 deaths (1-4). It briefly re-emerged in 2003-2004, with 4 confirmed cases of mild human infections and no human-to-human transmission (5-7).",
            "SARS-CoV has also been isolated from animals and been adapted to lab cell culture (5, 8-11). It is believed that bats and palm civets were the natural and intermediate reservoirs for SARS-CoV, respectively, and that SARS-CV transmitted from palm civets to humans in an animal market in Southern China (12-14). It has been reported that 2019-nCoV also infected humans in an animal market in Wuhan, although the animal source of the outbreak is currently unknown. Moreover, it has been confirmed that 2019-nCoV has the capacity to transmit from human to human.",
            "Coronaviruses are a large family of single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses and can be divided into four major genera (15). Both SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV belong to the  -genus. An envelope-anchored spike protein mediates coronavirus entry into host cells by first binding to a host receptor and then fusing viral and host membranes (16). A defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike specifically recognizes its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (17, 18). Different lines of research have shown that which host is susceptible to SARS-CoV infection is primarily determined by the affinity between the viral RBD and host ACE2 in the initial viral attachment step (19-23). In a span of about 10 years, we determined a series of crystal structures of SARS-CoV RBD complexed with ACE2; the RBDs were from SARS-CoV strains isolated from different hosts species in different years and the ACE2 receptor orthologues were derived from different animal species (18, 24-26). These structures showed that SARS-CoV RBD contains a core structure and a receptor-binding motif (RBM), and that the RBM binds to the outer surface of the claw-like structure of ACE2",

Furthermore, we discovered specific amino acids at 442, 472, 479, 480 and 487 positions that enhance viral binding to human ACE2, and some other amino acids at these same positions that enhance viral binding to civet ACE2 (Fig. 1C).
