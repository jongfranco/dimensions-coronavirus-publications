Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an economically important, highly contagious, acute, upper\u2010respiratory tract disease of chickens and other fowl, caused by the avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The virus is found worldwide and is transmitted by inhalation or direct contact with infected birds or contaminated litter, equipment, or other fomites. Vertical transmission of the virus within the embryo has not been reported, but virus may be present on the shell surface of hatching eggs via shedding from the oviduct or gastrointestinal tract. A poor viral polymerase proofreading mechanism resulting in genetic mutations and genome recombination events can lead to the emergence of new serotypes of the virus, which do not cross protect, \u00adcomplicating control by vaccination.<br/><br/>Avian coronaviruses similar to IBV also have been found in pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and peafowl (Galliformes) and IBV\u2010like viruses have been isolated from turkeys, teal (Anas crecca), geese (Anserinae), pigeons (Columbiformes), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), partridge (Alectoris), and ducks (Anseriformes) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>].

            "Ideal management includes strict isolation, high biosecurity, and repopulation with a single age of chicks, following the cleaning and disinfection of the poultry house and equipment in contact with poultry or poultry litter and composting or removal of the feces from the premises. Because IBV is highly infectious, immunization is needed in many areas in an attempt to prevent production losses due to IB.    Vaccination<br/><br/>Chickens just recovered from infection or recently vaccinated are protected from challenge with the same virus (homologous protection), but the extent of protection against challenge with other IBV strains (heterologous protection) varies. Challenge of vaccinated birds with homologous virus results in much lower shedding of challenge virus, and for a shorter period, than in unvaccinated birds [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c118\" href=\"#r118\">118</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c147\" href=\"#r147\">147</a>].<br/><br/>Types of Vaccine Both live and inactivated virus vaccines are used for IBV immunization. Live vaccines are used in meat type (broiler) chickens and for the initial vaccination and priming of breeders and layer pullets. Infectious bronchitis virus strains used for live vaccines are attenuated by serial passage in embryonating chicken eggs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], sometimes in combination with heat treatment [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c99\" href=\"#r99\">99</a>]. Evidence that some vaccines increased in virulence after back\u2010passage in chickens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>] demonstrates the potential for enhancement of virulence of such vaccines by continued circulation of the vaccine virus, a rolling infection, in a flock that is often caused by poor vaccination procedure, resulting in vaccination of only a fraction of birds in the house. The use of fractional doses of IB\u2010attenuated vaccines has been associated with enhancing cyclic infections in a flock and an increase in vaccine\u2010associated virulence."

Provision of additional heat to eliminate cold stress, good air quality, elimination of overcrowding, and attempts to maintain feed consumption to prevent weight loss are flock management factors that may help reduce losses from IB. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics may be used to aid in reducing the losses from airsacculitis resulting from infection by secondary bacterial pathogens. In case of clinical nephritis, a decrease in protein levels in the food and a supply of electrolyte replacers in the drinking water might be helpful to compensate for the acute loss of sodium and potassium and thereby reduce mortality from nephritis. The recommended concentration for treatment is 72 mEq of sodium and/or potassium, with at least one\u2010third in the citrate or bicarbonate salt form [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]."

Early descriptions of the disease were consistent with a mild form of infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>], but in 1936, Beach and Schalm using neutralization studies in chicks showed that the virus that caused IB was different from the virus that causes ILT [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",

In 1941, Delaplane and Stuart [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>] suggested that IBV propagated in embryonating eggs might have immunizing value, which led to the first IB vaccine report by van Roeckel et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c177\" href=\"#r177\">177</a>]. The first IBV vaccine in the United States was developed using the van Roekel M41 strain, which is a Mass serotype virus isolated at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1941.

The Coronaviridae family includes two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae, and within the Coronavirinae subfamily there are four genera, alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, deltacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus. Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are mammalian viruses. The deltacoronaviruses include species from wild birds and gammacoronaviruses include avian coronaviruses IBV and TCoV, as well as coronaviruses isolated from pheasant, goose, pigeon, and duck [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c104\" href=\"#r104\">104</a>].

Mutations include substitutions, which are the result of a high error rate and limited proofreading capability of the viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), as well as insertions and deletions, caused by recombination events or by RDRP stuttering or slippage.

Since the replicase gene was shown to be a determinant of pathogenicity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], recombination in the 1a/1ab genes associated with the RDRP can affect pathogenicity. Because the S glycoprotein gene is involved in host cell attachment (cell tropism) and contains viral neutralizing epitopes, recombination in the S glycoprotein gene can result in the emergence of new strains or serotypes of the virus as well as new viruses capable of causing disease in other host species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>].

These increases have been shown for agents such as Escherichia coli [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c129\" href=\"#r129\">129</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c130\" href=\"#r130\">130</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c164\" href=\"#r164\">164</a>], Mycoplasma gallisepticum [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c140\" href=\"#r140\">140</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c170\" href=\"#r170\">170</a>], Mycoplasma synoviae [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c113\" href=\"#r113\">113</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c119\" href=\"#r119\">119</a>], Mycoplasma imitans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>], Avibacterium paragallinarum [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c152\" href=\"#r152\">152</a>], Newcastle disease virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c139\" href=\"#r139\">139</a>], and avian influenza virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c142\" href=\"#r142\">142</a>]. The damage caused by these secondary infections can be substantial, especially in broilers, resulting in a higher mortality, growth depression, increase of feed conversion, and higher condemnation rates. Proper vaccination against IBV also can be useful to prevent the chickens developing clinical IB and subsequent E. coli airsacculitis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c129\" href=\"#r129\">129</a>].",
            "Although several strains of IBV are highly nephropathogenic, causing extensive and reproducible kidney \u00addisease in experimental conditions, many strains of IBV may be associated with nephritis to some degree in the field; environmental factors are probably important as to whether kidney complications are significant. The virulence of the strains for the kidney also depends on the age of infection. Young birds (less than two weeks of age) typically show more severe nephritis and higher mortality than older birds [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>, 188]. Cumming [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>] and Glahn et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c84\" href=\"#r84\">84</a>] enumerated some of the management factors that contribute to IB\u2010related kidney disease. Greater mortality was seen in males, with cold stress, in certain breeds, increased levels of dietary calcium or when \u00adanimal byproducts were the major component of high\u2010 protein diets. Some of these factors known to exacerbate the clinical disease have been used in experimental \u00admodels to evaluate the clinical outcome of interaction between such factors and different IBV strains. Reddy et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c154\" href=\"#r154\">154</a>] reported significant differences between the replication kinetics of the nephropathogenic B1648 and respiratory M41 IBV strains when compared in vitro in respiratory mucosa explants and blood monocytes (KUL01(+) cells), and in vivo in chickens that might explain the different behavior of these strains in chickens.",
            "Virulence for the reproductive tract also may differ among IBV strains. Presence of maternal antibody could prevent damage to the oviduct during an early\u2010age IBV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. In susceptible layers, different IBV strains produced a range of effects varying from shell pigment changes with no production drop to production drops of up to 70% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].",
            "The virulence of IBV strains for other organs such as the alimentary tract seems to be low (reviewed in 70).

Those studies did not show proof of local replication of the involved IBV strains, and the mortalities were exceptionally high for a solely IBV\u2010 induced disease. It remains unclear whether the reported signs were only caused by the IB strain or that another agent might be involved.",
            "In recent years, coronaviruses have been detected in an increasing number of bird species and turkey, pheasant, goose, pigeon, and duck coronaviruses are considered avian coronaviruses in the gammacoronavirus with IBV. Mostly, the strains were not isolated but were detected by RT\u2010PCR and sequencing, and little to no clinical signs were observed in these birds. Consequently, the majority of the detected strains could not be inoculated into chickens to determine infectivity and virulence. An exception are the coronaviruses isolated from pheasants with respiratory and kidney disease. These viruses differ in gene sequence from IBV to an extent similar to that exhibited by different serotypes of IBV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. When three coronavirus isolates from pheasants were inoculated into chickens, no signs of disease were observed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c124\" href=\"#r124\">124</a>], which led to pheasant coronavirus (PhCoV) being officially considered as a species distinct from IBV. The issue of the coronavirus species determination is thoroughly discussed here [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>].",
            "Infectious bronchitis is distributed worldwide and many dozens of serotypes and genotypes have been detected in all continents except Antarctica [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>]. The first IBV variants were detected in the 1950s in the United States [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>]; however, a retrospective study [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c103\" href=\"#r103\">103</a>] has shown that IBV variants were already circulating in the US poultry industries in the 1940s. Several serotypes can cocirculate in a given region with some strains being detected on several continents, while others seem to be regional.",
            "As explained previously, it is now accepted that the chicken is not the only host for IBV, although it is possible that IBV only causes disease in the chicken.",
            "Age of Host Commonly Affected All ages are susceptible, but the disease is most severe in chicks, often causing some mortality, especially with nephropathogenic strains. As age increases, chickens become more resistant to the nephropathogenic effects, oviduct lesions, and mortality due to infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>].",

The disease has a short incubation period: susceptible birds placed with recently infected chickens usually develop clinical signs within 24\u201348 hours.",
            "Transmission may be by either inhalation or ingestion of infectious virus particles by direct contact between infected and susceptible birds; by indirect contact through aerosol droplets or feces; and by exposure to virus\u2010contaminated fomites, such as clothing, shoes, tools, and so on. Aerosol generation from the respiratory tract is a significant mode of transmission because of high virus concentrations in the respiratory tract during the acute stage of the infection. The highest concentration of IBV can be detected in the trachea during the first 3\u20135 days PI. After this period, the virus titer in the respiratory tract drops rapidly and in the second week PI can already be below the level of detection, especially in birds with a certain level of protection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>]. Most likely, transmission by aerosol is especially effective over short distances, such as within a flock or premises, because the enveloped virion is inactivated relatively quickly in the environment.",
            "The virus is also excreted in the feces and in the uric acid from kidney. During the chronic stage of an IBV infection, virus can be more readily detectable in the intestinal tract (cecal tonsils or cloaca swabs) and for a longer time than in the respiratory tract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>]. Several authors report a long\u2010term recovery (2\u20137 months) of IBV from infected or vaccinated flocks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c141\" href=\"#r141\">141</a>]; others report a re\u2010excretion of IBV following T cell suppression by cyclosporine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>] or at onset of lay [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c105\" href=\"#r105\">105</a>]. Possible explanations of long\u2010term isolations or re\u2010excretion of an inoculated virus are continual cross\u2010infection within infected or vaccinated flocks, continual excretion of the virus at levels usually below the detection levels of tests, reactivation after treatment with cyclosporin [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], or reinfection due to contact with the infected feces from the previous infection after a decrease in level of protection. The two main candidate sites mentioned in these reports for persistence are cecal tonsils and kidney. The phenomena of possible long\u2010term excretion and re\u2010 excretion may result in flock\u2010to\u2010flock transmission by direct or indirect contact with contaminated litter, fomites, or personnel, but further study is needed to understand if this is a common source of transmission.",
            "Vertical transmission does not seem to be relevant for IBV, although Cook [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>] could reisolate the challenge virus after infection in laying SPF hens and cockerels for 2 weeks from semen, for 1\u20137 weeks from the vitelline membrane of the eggs, and even from a small number of hatched chicks. However, the implication of this last finding for the field remained unclear, because these chicks developed no clinical signs, did not seroconvert, and were not protected against challenge.",
            "In view of the recent discovery of IBV in species other than the chicken, it should be considered that other species of birds might not only be able to transport IBV mechanically but also may actively multiply IBV or be a source of IBV outbreaks.",
            "Incubation Period The incubation period of IB is dose dependent and can be as short as 18 hours for intratracheal inoculation and up to 36 hours for ocular application.",
            "returns to the preinfection level, but in some cases, this is never attained.",
            "In addition to production declines, IBV infections can cause a range of effects on the egg quality varying from loss of shell pigment, shell quality (misshapen, thin, soft\u2010 shelled, and rough\u2010shelled eggs, Figure 4.4), thin to watery albumen (Figure 4.5) in a fresh egg, and decreased hatchability. Flocks with false layers fail to reach the normal rate of lay, whereas the flock looks healthy, behaves normally, and produces good quality eggs. The peak of production can be as low as 35% of expected production values [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].",
            "The nonspecific respiratory signs of IB in susceptible chicks are gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge. Watery eyes may be observed, and an occasional chick may have swollen sinuses. The chicks appear depressed and may be seen huddled under a heat source. Feed consumption and weight gain may be significantly reduced. In chickens, older than six weeks of age, the signs are usually less clear, and the disease may even go unnoticed unless the flock is examined carefully by handling the birds or listening to them at night when the birds are normally quiet. The severity of the respiratory signs is influenced by the quality of the climate, housing, kind of bird, strain involved, IB vaccination program, and presence of coinfections including secondary infections.",
            "Broiler chickens infected with a nephropathogenic virus may appear to recover from the respiratory phase and then show signs of depression, ruffled feathers, wet droppings, increased water intake, and mortality [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. Young age, cold stress, breed of chicken, increased levels of dietary calcium, and high\u2010protein diets containing animal byproducts as the protein source are predisposing factors for the development of clinical signs during an infection with a nephropathogenic strain [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c114\" href=\"#r114\">114</a>].",

Following IBV infection at the onset of production a more severe drop in total production of normally shelled eggs, an increase in the number of abnormally shelled eggs, and more lasting adverse effects on egg weight and internal egg quality were observed, in comparison with infection after peak production. With mild drops in production, a normal level of production can be restored in 1 or 2 weeks. With severe drops of production, 6\u20138 weeks may elapse before production",

Air sacs may be foamy during the acute infection and then may become cloudy and contain a yellow caseous exudate. Areas of pneumonia may be observed around the large bronchi.

Hyperplasia is followed by massive infiltration of the lamina propria by lymphoid cells and the formation of a large number of germinal centers often forming after 7 days. If air sac involvement occurs, there is edema, epithelial cell desquamation, and some fibrinous exudate within 24 hours. Increased heterophils can be observed later with lymphoid nodules, fibroblast proliferation, and regeneration by cuboidal epithelial cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c155\" href=\"#r155\">155</a>] (Figure 4.7A, B, C, D, E, F).",

The lesions in tubules are most prominent in the medulla. Focal areas of necrosis may be seen along with indications of attempted regeneration of the tubular epithelium. During recovery, the inflammatory cell population changes to lymphocytes and plasma cells. In some cases, degenerative changes may persist and result in severe atrophy of one or all of the divisions of the nephrons.

Several groups have reported a negative effect of high levels of maternal antibodies against the vaccine strain when it is applied on day of hatch, whereas others did not detect a lower efficacy of the day\u2010old vaccination in the presence of maternal antibodies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>].",
            "Diagnosis of IB is based on the clinical history, lesions, seroconversion (rising IBV antibody titers), IBV antigen detection by a number of antibody\u2010based antigen capture assays, virus isolation, and detection of IBV RNA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>]. Thorough diagnosis of IBV includes identification of the serotype or genetic type of the virus so that appropriate vaccines can be used. The many approaches used to detect the virus or antibodies induced by it have been described and critically compared [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>] .",
            "Although primarily a respiratory pathogen, IBV also can infect epithelial cells in the kidney, oviduct, and gastrointestinal tract. Knowledge of the pathogenesis of IBV, reviewed in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c153\" href=\"#r153\">153</a>], has been instructive for effective \u00adsample collection to detect the virus.",
            "Virus Isolation Tracheal swabs or fresh tracheal tissue is the preferred sample, especially within the first week of infection, and samples should constantly be kept cold (on wet ice) until tested. Titers of IBV reach a maximum in the trachea by day 3\u20135 PI, after which they decline rapidly. Because the virus initially grows in the upper respiratory tract and then spreads to non\u2010respiratory tissues, kidney and cecal tonsils collected at postmortem examination can be of value in cases in which more than one week has elapsed since the start of infection. However, it should be recognized that vaccine viruses could also be found persisting in cecal tonsils. Although the virus can replicate in the gastrointestinal tract, cloacal swabs or fecal material are difficult samples from which to isolate the virus. Additionally, samples from the lung, kidney, and oviduct should be considered, depending on the clinical history of the flock [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
            "When collecting samples from a large flock, both healthy birds and those with clinical signs should be sampled. Typically, clinical signs begin 3\u20135 days following infection when the virus is no longer at peak titer. In mild cases of the disease, clinical signs due to the virus may go unnoticed until secondary pathogens become involved, at which time IBV is no longer present. Alternatively, the placement of susceptible sentinel chickens has been described [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>] and can be beneficial when direct sampling is unsuccessful.",
            "Samples for virus isolation commonly are inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9\u2010 to 10\u2010day\u2010old embryonating chicken eggs or TOCs, preferably from an SPF source. Fluids should be harvested after 48\u201372 hours from either culture system and passed at least 3\u20134 times before being called negative based on failure to cause lesions or death in embryos, or ciliostasis in TOCs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c81\" href=\"#r81\">81</a>]. However, these observations are not in themselves sufficient to confirm the presence of IBV; the presence of the virus must be confirmed by VN, HI, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, detection of the viral nucleic acid, or electron microscopy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].",
            "Coronaviruses similar to IBV in wild or domestic birds other than chickens may or may not replicate in embryonating chicken eggs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c104\" href=\"#r104\">104</a>].",
            "Confirmation and Typing of IBV by Antibody\u2010Based Methods Detection of IBV directly or indirectly in postmortem material (scrapings of tracheal mucosa or other tissues) or virus grown in embryonating eggs using serotype specific or monoclonal antibodies has been done but the results are not always easy to interpret, especially from direct field specimens because of nonspecific reactions (reviewed in [62]). All IBV serotypes appear to have common epitopes (group\u2010specific antigens) likely due to the moderately high amino acid sequence identity within the N and M proteins and conserved regions of the S2 protein. Following a first infection with IBV, most of the antibody response is serotype\u2010specific. A second infection, especially with a different serotype, results in a more broadly reactive serum. Because chickens in the field will almost certainly have been vaccinated (sometimes multiple times) with attenuated live vaccines (broilers and pullets) and killed vaccines (layers and breeders) against IB, field sera are not very useful for serotyping unknown viruses. Only sera induced experimentally (the procedure can be found in [81]) using SPF chickens should be used for determining the serotype of a virus.",
            "The serotype of IBV has traditionally been determined by the VN or HI test (see Serotype Classification, above). However, virus\u2010neutralization testing, whether conducted in embryonating eggs or in TOC, is time consuming and labor intensive, and the HI test suffers from nonspecific cross\u2010reactivity. Thus, molecular\u2010based tests have for the most part replaced VN and HI testing.",
            "Confirmation and Typing of IBV by Nucleic Acid\u2010Based Methods The real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR test, also known as quantitative RT\u2010PCR, is becoming more widely used to detect IBV directly from clinical samples [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c98\" href=\"#r98\">98</a>]. Advantages of this test are that many samples can be examined in a short period of time, it is cost\u2010effective, and it gives an indication of the level of viral nucleic acid in the sample. Recently IBV type specific primers and probes for some strains of the virus have been developed for real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR IBV type specific testing [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c156\" href=\"#r156\">156</a>].",
            "Conventional RT\u2010PCR also can be used to detect the presence of IBV nucleic acid in a clinical sample; however, passage in embryonating eggs is sometimes necessary to obtain a positive result. Identification of the type of IBV in the sample is determined by sequence analysis of amplicons from the S1 gene (see Genetic Classification, above). Advantages of genetic typing includes a rapid turnaround time and the ability to detect a wide variety of IBV types. The hypervariable region of the S1 gene can be used to genetically type IBV in a diagnostic laboratory setting but the entire S1 gene should be used for complete characterization. Spike sequence data can be used to identify any IBV type as well as previously unknown field isolates and variants and phylogenetic analysis of unknown field isolates and variants with reference strains can be used to establish relatedness [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c100\" href=\"#r100\">100</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c112\" href=\"#r112\">112</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c120\" href=\"#r120\">120</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c136\" href=\"#r136\">136</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c143\" href=\"#r143\">143</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c176\" href=\"#r176\">176</a>].",
            "Demonstration of rising antibody titers against IBV between preclinical and convalescent sera can be used to diagnose IBV infection. Because the ELISA, immunofluorescence, and agar gel precipitan (AGP) tests all bind antibody to group\u2010specific antigens, they cannot be used to differentiate serotypes. Currently the ELISA test is the most widely used serologic test for antibodies against IBV because it is inexpensive and can be used to test a large number of samples in a short time. Commercial tests are available and typically detect antibodies (IgG) after one week postinfection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c127\" href=\"#r127\">127</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c133\" href=\"#r133\">133</a>].",
            "Routine serology also can be done with the AGP and HI tests, reviewed in [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>]. Although the AGP test can detect antibodies within the first week of infection, the strongest precipitating antibodies (IgM) are short\u2010lived, and IgG is poorly reactive. Thus, the AGP test is not recommended for detection of antibodies beyond two weeks PI [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>]. Although cross\u2010reactive antibodies can be detected in the HI test, sensitivity may suffer, because this is largely a serotype\u2010specific reaction. Nonetheless, the low cost, simple equipment, and speed of the HI test makes it a useful procedure as long as the test limitations are considered.",
            "The clinical presentation of IB may resemble mild forms of other acute respiratory diseases such as Newcastle disease (ND), ILT, low\u2010pathogenicity avian influenza, avian metapneumovirus, and infectious coryza.",
            "Newcastle disease caused by velogenic viscerotropic or neurotropic strains of paramyxovirus type 1 produces much higher mortality than IBV. Lentogenic ND virus infections with pneumotropic strains and low pathogenicity strains of avian influenza like H9N2 produce mild to moderate respiratory disease with low mortality and, thus, may resemble IB. Infectious laryngotracheitis tends to spread more slowly in a flock, but respiratory signs may be more severe than with IB, and infectious coryza typically causes facial swelling that occurs only rarely in IB. Egg production declines and shell quality problems in flocks infected with ND virus, avian influenza virus, ILT virus, avian metapneumovirus, and Avibacterium paragallinarum (infectious coryza) as well as avian mycoplasmas and EDS adenovirus are similar to those seen with IBV, except that in the case of EDS \u00adadenovirus, internal egg quality is not affected."

            "Ideal management includes strict isolation, high biosecurity, and repopulation with a single age of chicks, following the cleaning and disinfection of the poultry house and equipment in contact with poultry or poultry litter and composting or removal of the feces from the premises. Because IBV is highly infectious, immunization is needed in many areas in an attempt to prevent production losses due to IB.",
            "Chickens just recovered from infection or recently vaccinated are protected from challenge with the same virus (homologous protection), but the extent of protection against challenge with other IBV strains (heterologous protection) varies.

Evidence that some vaccines increased in virulence after back\u2010passage in chickens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>] demonstrates the potential for enhancement of virulence of such vaccines by continued circulation of the vaccine virus, a rolling infection, in a flock that is often caused by poor vaccination procedure, resulting in vaccination of only a fraction of birds in the house. The use of fractional doses of IB\u2010attenuated vaccines has been associated with enhancing cyclic infections in a flock and an increase in vaccine\u2010associated virulence.",
            "The Mass/Mass41/41 strain, Mass/H120/55, and other vaccines of the Massachusetts serotype are commonly used in most countries. The goal of a vaccination program is to cover the antigenic spectrum of isolates in a particular country or region. When vaccinations with a single serotype are not providing sufficient protection against the prevailing field strains, vaccines of other serotypes can be added to the program.

Besides the convenience, vaccination in a hatchery can be much better controlled than that in the poultry house.",
            "Application by the drinking water system requires management measures to be taken to ensure that all birds can drink a sufficient amount of freshly prepared vaccine within a few hours, and should include the complete emptying of the water system before filling it with the vaccine. The water that is used with the vaccine should be of high quality, cold, and free of chemicals that can harm the vaccine such as sanitizers (many municipal sources of water contain chlorine, which can inactivate the vaccine). The incorporation of powdered skim milk at a 1 : 400 concentration or another suitable product has been shown to stabilize the virus titer during vaccine administration and resulted in better IBV and NDV immune responses in a field trial with 76 flocks [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c82\" href=\"#r82\">82</a>].",

Provision of additional heat to eliminate cold stress, good air quality, elimination of overcrowding, and attempts to maintain feed consumption to prevent weight loss are flock management factors that may help reduce losses from IB. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics may be used to aid in reducing the losses from airsacculitis resulting from infection by secondary bacterial pathogens. In case of clinical nephritis, a decrease in protein levels in the food and a supply of electrolyte replacers in the drinking water might be helpful to compensate for the acute loss of sodium and potassium and thereby reduce mortality from nephritis. The recommended concentration for treatment is 72 mEq of sodium and/or potassium, with at least one\u2010third in the citrate or bicarbonate salt form [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]."
