This coronavirus-induced pneumonia originated from Wuhan (China), and has spread across 27 countries, infected 17,488 people and caused 362 deaths, at the this Editorial went to press. The transmission of 2019-nCoV to individuals of different countries is predominantly through close contact with an infected person. The experts around the global raise the concern on the rising number of infected cases and deaths, and increased the effort to produce an effective drug or vaccine for this virus. Several efforts have been done to aid the detection of the virus and treatment of patients: 2019-nCoV detection kits (BGI), and development of two new hospital, and treating patients with combination of antiviral for flu and HIV. In the United States, doctors successfully treated a 2019-nCoV patient with Gilead Sciences drug \u2013 remdesivir, however further test need to be done to confirm the effectiveness of these antivirals. Hopefully, the pharmaceutical companies with the team of researchers will be able to discover an effective vaccine to treat coronavirus 2019-nCoV.",
