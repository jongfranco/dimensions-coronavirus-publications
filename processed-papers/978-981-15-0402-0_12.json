        "abstract": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important swine disease worldwide. There are two distinct antigenically different genotypes of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV): the European (type I) and North American (type II), which cause the same disease symptoms. In the last three decades, the disease has evolved from classical form to most devastating highly pathogenic PRRS. Although tremendous progress has been made in understanding the disease, there are many unanswered questions regarding pathogenesis and immunobiology of PRRSV. The virus appears to use several evasion strategies to circumvent both innate and acquired immunity, including interference with antigen presentation, antibody-mediated enhancement, reduced cell surface expression of viral proteins and shielding of neutralising epitopes. Presently available vaccines are ineffective because they suffer both from the immune evasion strategies of the virus and the antigenic heterogeneity of field strains. Recent signs of progress made on viral reverse genetics, genomics and host transcriptomics, vaccinology and adjuvant technologies have identified new areas for control and prevention of PRRS.",
