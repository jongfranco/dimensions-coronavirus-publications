            "Cases of a novel type of contagious pneumonia were first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Chinese health authorities have determined that a novel coronavirus (CoV), denoted as 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2), is the cause of this pneumonia outbreak (COVID-19)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Existing evidence have confirmed the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV3. We retrospectively collected infection data from 2nd to 22nd January 2020 at six departments (Respiratory, ICU, Infectious Disease, Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Surgery, Trauma and Microsurgery, and Urology) from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Medical staff (doctors and nurses) followed differential routines of occupational protection: (a) staff at the Departments of Respiratory Medicine, ICU, and Infectious Disease (mainly quarantined area) wore N95 respirators, and disinfected and cleaned their hands frequently (the N95 group); (b) medical staff in the other three departments wore no medical masks, and disinfected and cleaned their hands only occasionally (the no-mask group). The difference was because the latter departments were not considered to be high risk in the early days of the outbreak."
