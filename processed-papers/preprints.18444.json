Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using HON code, JAMA benchmark, DISCERN instrument, and Google rank.\n                \n                                \n                    RESULTS\n                        The Google search returned 309,000,000 hits, the first 110 websites were critically analyzed, only 1.81% of the websites had the HONE code seal. The JAMA benchmark showed that 43 websites did not have any of the categories required by this tool and only 11 of the websites had the four quality criteria required by JAMA. The DISCERN score showed that 51.81% of the websites were evaluated as very poor and 0.9% rated as excellent.\n                \n                                \n                    CONCLUSIONS\n                        Users and the scientific community need to be aware of the quality of the information they read and produce respectively. The Wuhan Coronavirus health crisis misinformation was produced by the media and the misinformation the users obtain from the net. The use of the internet has a risk to public health and in cases like this, the trending topic time lasted while no quality information was available.",
