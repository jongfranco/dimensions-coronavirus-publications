The model in this work is parameterized with the latest data until Feb. 11, 2020, reported by the NHC and HCH. A major limitation of this work is that we describe the epidemic data in Hubei with the symmetrical even function. Usually, the epidemic would recede with a long tail, and we might underestimate the total infections and deaths in Hubei, and also the end date. Another limitation is that although we process separately the data of Hubei and China other than Hubei, this is still quite rough for the considerable differences among cities within Hubei province. Also, as a data-driven forecast study, the seasonality of COVID-19 transmission, the effects of the quarantine, the limitations on population transportation, and other specific reasons that may affect the spread of the epidemic, are not explicitly included in the study. At last, we expect this outbreak would end as soon as possible."
