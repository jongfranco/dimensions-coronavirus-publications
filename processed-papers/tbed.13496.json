        "abstract": "The introduction and spread of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) in North America resulted in significant death loss in the swine industry. As the industry learned how to manage this disease, many new risks were identified, including the potential for feed and feed ingredients to become contaminated and spread PEDV. In addition, biosecurity practices were reevaluated and strengthened throughout the industry. At the time of the outbreak epidemiologists did not understand, as well as they are understood today, all the risk factors that contribute to the spread of PEDV. As a result, the epidemiological investigations into the 2014 PEDV outbreak in eastern Canada may not have investigated all risk factors as thoroughly as they would be investigated today. In retrospect, many of the Bradford Hill criteria used to determine causation were not fulfilled. This review identifies risk factors that were not included in the 2014 epidemiology. If these risk factors were included in the epidemiology, the conclusions and determination of causation may have been different.",

The SDPP investigated by CFIA was produced over 10 weeks before the Index case and over 13 weeks before CFIA collected their sample (NASDBPP, 2014b).

If PEDV virus was already present in eastern Canada prior to the Index case, and if feed biosecurity protocols were not as rigorous as those in place today, environmental contamination (feed manufacturing facility or equipment) and multiple sampling of the same bag(s) creates the potential for contamination of the SDPP sample CFIA collected and examined in their bioassay."

            "Many important observations were not included in the epidemiological investigation of the 2014 PEDV outbreak in Canada.<br/><br/>\u2022 The timeline associated with PEDV-positive environmental contamination and the reported Index case was not considered.<br/><br/>\u2022 Inadequately cleaned trucks returning to Canada after delivering pigs to US abattoirs was not considered as a source of PEDV introduction in eastern Canada.<br/><br/>\u2022 Animal and truck traffic between common sites (including the contaminated Quebec abattoir or assembly yard) and the PEDVinfected farms were not considered.<br/><br/>\u2022 The possibility that imported non-animal feed ingredients contaminated with PEDV, such as soybean meal, could have introduced PEDV into eastern Canada was not investigated.<br/><br/>\u2022 Results of the FDA investigation of the production records and retained samples of the implicated lot of SDPP were not considered.<br/><br/>If these observations were included the conclusions may have changed. For example:<br/><br/>\u2022 It is possible that PEDV was present in Canada prior to the Index case.<br/><br/>\u2022 It is possible that minimal cleaning of trucks returning from US slaughter plants or PEDV-contaminated imported non-animal feed ingredients resulted in the introduction of PEDV into Canada leading to contamination of the Quebec abattoir and the Ontario assembly yard. \u2022 It is possible that contact with the contaminated Ontario assembly yard contributed to the spread of PEDV among many of the initial PEDV-infected farms. \u2022 There is no support for the suggestion that a breach in good manufacturing practices was responsible for the infective PEDV CFIA reported on the SDPP sample they collected. \u2022 If PEDV was present in Ontario prior to the Index case, multiple sampling of the remaining suspected SDPP at the feed manufacturing site could have contaminated the sample of SDPP tested by the CFIA.<br/><br/>In retrospect, it is not possible to definitively identify the source of PEDV introduced into Canada. It is not possible to definitively determine the source of PEDV contamination in the sample of SDPP tested by CFIA. It will not be possible to definitively determine if truck movement including feed delivery or animal movement was involved in the spread of PEDV. It will not be possible to definitively determine if imported non-animal feed ingredients introduced PEDV into eastern Canada. However, if the risk factors for the spread of PEDV had been better understood at the time of the initial epidemiology, it is possible that additional data would have been collected during the investigations and the conclusions could have been different."

In mice challenged with inhaled LPS, dietary SDPP reduced inflammatory cytokine production in lung tissue, reduced shedding of lymphocytes in BALF fluid and reduced other inflammatory markers (Maij\u00f3 et al, 2012b, 2012a). Inbred mice subjected to transport stress, dietary SDPP has been shown to improve embryo implantation and survival, improve foetal growth and reduce uterine inflammation (Liu et al, 2018; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSong_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rSong_et+al_2015_a\">Song et al, 2015</a>).
