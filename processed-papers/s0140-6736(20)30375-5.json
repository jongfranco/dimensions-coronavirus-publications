            "The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19; previously known as 2019-nCoV) outbreak that originated from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, at the end of 2019 was declared a public health emergency of international concern on Jan 30, 2020, by WHO.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] As a newly appearing infectious disease, COVID-19 garnered great research interest. According to a recent report in Nature,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] at least 54 academic papers about COVID-19 were published in English-language journals by Jan 30, 2020.",
            "We searched major Chinese data\u00ad bases including the China National Knowledge Internet and WANFANG Data. As of Feb 3, 2020, just 23 Chineselanguage papers on COVID-19 were published. These publications mainly focused on epidemiology, clinical fea\u00ad tures of COVID-19, and the structure or genetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).",
            "Many of the research papers about COVID-19 in international journals were written by researchers in China, which led to great concerns because these findings cannot directly benefit frontline health professionals and policy makers because of the language barrier. It is critical for health science to be published in English-language journals to facilitate communication and enable global coordination and timely epidemic response. However, some media were concerned that Chinese researchers within academic organisations concentrated on publishing papers in prestigious international journals but paid inadequate attention to epidemic prevention of COVID-19 and neglected to disseminate their findings within Chinese-language journals.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] A recent statement by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China also encouraged researchers to focus their efforts on epidemic prevention and to publish their results in Chinese.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]",

            "Broad dissemination in both Chinese and English will accomplish the goals of communicating timely and crucial findings to the international scientific community, while also disseminating this information to health-care workers on the frontline who need to under\u00ad stand the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19. This strategy will improve effective control strategies to ultimately contain the virus and protect the health of the public.",

            "The three flu pandemics of the 20th century, in 1918, 1957, and 1968,1 caused millions of deaths, mainly from acute respiratory failure. More recently, outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, in 2012, have been characterised by human-tohuman transmission and high inci\u00ad dence of acute respiratory failure. The growing alarm for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spreading from China brings back the spectre of the rapidly diffusing pandemics of the past.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]",
            "Non-invasive ventilation is an effective and common treatment for patients with mild to moderate acute respiratory failure.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] It is associated with mortality reduction compared to either spontaneous breathing or mechanical ventilation by endotracheal tube as supported by several randomised trials.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Emergency departments and intensive care units are increasingly applying non-invasive ventilation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] When used to treat acute respiratory failure, noninvasive ventilation is applied to the patient mainly by face mask or helmet.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]",
            "Since coronavirus diffusion takes place by droplet transmission,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] aero\u00ad solisation during hospital procedures like intubation or bronchos\u00ad copy might represent a big concern, exposing other patients and health-care staff to an increased risk of infection, as during the flu pandemia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Aerosolisation with nosocomial amplification of the infection can also potentially happen around the face mask during noninvasive ventilation, as demonstrated in different simul\u00adation studies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] Accordingly, the efficacy and safety of non-invasive ventilation during viral pandemic infection are still debated. However, during pandemics, the number of intensive care unit beds for mechanical ventilation through tracheal intubation could rapidly become insufficient,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] whereas noninvasive ventilation can be offered also outside the intensive care unit.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]",
            "To increase safety during non-inva\u00ad sive ventilation, use of a helmet as a non-invasive ventilation interface can be considered to avoid aerosolisation when the helmet is connected to the ventilator without air dispersion through a spring-valve; unfortunately, a helmet costs more than most face masks. Accordingly, when facing a patient with acute respiratory failure of suspected viral nature (and, above all, during pandemics), we recommend the adoption of helmets and avoidance of face masks as the non-invasive ventilation interface. Moreover, we suggest that manufacturers should develop cheap and safe non-invasive ventilation interfaces to be used during viral pandemics.",
