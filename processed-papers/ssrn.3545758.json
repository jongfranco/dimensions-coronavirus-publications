        "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal",
        "abstract": "This paper graphically demonstrates the patterns of economic recession from any epidemic in the world, i.e. the Wuhan COVID-19 contagious infectious disease. This can generate economic waves on different markets (countries or regions). This paper evaluates the way in which an economic recession from the Wuhan COVID-19 contagious infectious disease damage can simultaneously affect five different markets economic hotspots viz. East Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), China, ASEAN, United States and the European Union (EU). To visualize how a worldwide epidemic can generate economic waves on world economy, it is necessary to apply the inter-linkage coordinate space. Finally, this paper proposes the use of computer graphical animation, which is based on the construction of a large number of slides joined together through the production of a video. In our case, we will use Windows Microsoft movie maker software to generate the real time effect of these economic waves in the same graphical space.",
