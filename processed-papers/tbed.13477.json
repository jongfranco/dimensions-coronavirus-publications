        "abstract": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an ongoing emergence enveloped virus with a singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome, belongs to the Gammacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family. IBV-associated tracheitis, nephritis, salpingitis, proventriculitis and egg drop have caused devastating economic losses to poultry industry worldwide. Since the end of 2018, a remarkably increasing number of commercial broilers and layers, vaccinated or not, were infected with IBV in China. Here, we described two IB outbreaks with severe respiratory system or kidney injury in IBV-vaccinated commercial poultry farms in central China. Other possible causative viral pathogens, including avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Kedah fatal kidney syndrome virus (KFKSV), were excluded by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and three virulent IBV strains, HeN-1/China/2019, HeN-2/ China/2019 and HeN-101/China/2019, were identified. Although the gross pathologic appearance of these two IB outbreaks was different, the newly identified IBV strains were all closely related to the ck/China/I0529/17 strain and grouped into GI-19 genotype clade based on the sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 genes. Moreover, there are still some evolutionary distance between the newly identified IBV strains, HeN-101/China/2019 in particular, and other GI-19 strains, suggesting that Chinese IBV strains constantly emerge and evolve towards different directions. In conclusion, this study provided an insight of the recently emerging IBV outbreaks in IBV-vaccinated commercial poultry farms and identified the genetic characteristics of three virulent GI-19 IBV strains, which shows the need to carry out proper preventive measures and control strategies.",

            "In conclusion, this study identified two virulent GI-19 IBV strains in IBV-vaccinated commercial broiler farm during the recent wave of IBV outbreaks in China. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these newly identified IBV strains are closely related to the ck/ China/I0529/17 strain. However, there are still some evolutionary distance between the newly identified IBV strains and other GI-19 strains and contain several special amino acid mutations in the HVR regions of S1 protein, suggesting that Chinese IBV strains constantly emerge and evolve towards different directions. This study provides an insight on recently emerging IBV outbreaks, which shows the need to carry out proper preventive measures and control strategies."

According to the breeder's description, approximately onetenth of 20,000 25-day-old broilers, vaccinated with commercial live attenuated IBV vaccine H120 at 7-day-old, showed severe respiratory symptoms, such as gasping, nasal discharge, tracheal rales, sneezing, and some affected flocks also presented greenishyellow diarrhoea, watery eyes and lethargy. The outbreak started from 18 April 2019, and antibiotic-antimycotic combination therapy did not work. A total of ten dead broilers (5/10) and illness broilers (5/10) were selected randomly to send to the laboratory for diagnosis.",
            "Case 2: In September 2019, an outbreak of fatal nephritis disease occurred in another commercial layer farm in Henan Province. According to the breeder's description, the farm has approximate 9,000 layers with 21-day-old, which were vaccinated with commercial live attenuated IBV vaccine H120 at 7-day-old. The great majority of the flocks started to show moderate respiratory symptoms from 10 September 2019, and mitigated in a week with the antibiotic and traditional veterinary drugs combination therapies. Since 20 September, about 200 chickens per day died acutely without obvious clinical symptom. Six moribund layers were selected randomly to send to the laboratory for diagnosis."

As shown in Figure S1a, lung and trachea samples collected from first outbreak were positive for IBV, whereas no corresponding nucleotide fragments were observed for AIV and NDV. Moreover, kidney and spleen samples collected from second outbreak were positive for IBV, and no PCR fragments was observed for AIV, NDV and KFKSV.

Nucleotide identity of the S1 genes between HeN-1/China/2019 and HeN-2/China/2019 was 99.9%, and the identity between HeN-101/China/2019 and HeN-102/ China/2019 was 100%, indicated that the two IB outbreaks were caused by a single IBV strains, HeN-2/China/2019 and HeN-101/ China/2019, respectively. The sequences were further submitted to NCBI (GenBank accession numbers: MN055627, MN055628 and MN635798). Blast analysis revealed that all isolates were genetically closed to the GI-19 genotype strain ck/China/I0529/17, isolated from broiler in 2017. Also, genetic analysis based on the complete S1 gene revealed that the HeN-2/China/2019 and HeN101/China/2019 strains shared the high homology with QX (96.0% and 95.4%) and LX4 (97.6% and 96.6%), the representative strains in the GI-19 genotype. However, these two strains displayed low similarity in gene identity to Chinese available commercial vaccines H120 (74.9% and 74.6%), 4/91 (77.0% and 77.3%) and LDT3-A (83.5% and 82.9%), respectively.",

We further investigated the recombinant events between GI-19 and other IBV genotypes using the RDP4 software. The results showed that several recombinant events occurred between GI-19 and other IBV genotypes with high score (p < .01, recombinant score >0.6), including strains of the newly identified genotype GI-28, GI-25 and unassigned strain LDT3 (Figure S2). Interestingly, the GI-19 genotype plays a two-faced role in these recombinant events, not only providing fragments for other strains, but also receiving fragments during infection.",
            "To further explore the characteristics of the newly identified IBV strains, amino acid polymorphism of the S1 glycoprotein was compared with other IBV strains of all 35 genotypes (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rChen_et+al_2017_a\">Chen et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJiang_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rJiang_et+al_2017_a\">Jiang et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMa_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rMa_et+al_2019_a\">Ma et al, 2019</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cValastro_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rValastro_et+al_2016_a\">Valastro et al, 2016</a>). The result revealed that most of the amino acid mutations in S1 region of the newly identified IBV strains were located in the three HVR regions. Meanwhile, several amino acid mutations were only found in HeN-2/ China/2019 (P87L, T300I and H329Y) and HeN-101/China/2019 (Q89K, S96A, Q97E, S117A, T120R, A130E, R131S, A195S, Q315H and I511M) among GI-19 strains (Table 1). Compared with the available capsid structure of M41 strain in the PDB database (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cShang_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rShang_et+al_2018_a\">Shang et al, 2018</a>), the P87L and Q89K mutations are adjacent to HVR I and HVR II region structurally (Figure 3c) and located in the major receptor-binding domain (19 aa-253 aa; Promkuntod, van Eijndhoven, de Vrieze, Grone, & Verheije, 2014); the Q97E, S117A, T120R, A130E and R131S are in HVR II region; the T300I and H329Y are in HVR III region (Figure 3d), indicating that these mutations might change virus antigenicity.",
            "IB is an economically important avian disease that affects the poultry industries worldwide, particularly in the large poultry-producing countries, such as USA, China and Brazil (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBande_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rBande_et+al_2017_a\">Bande et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJackwood_2013_a\" href=\"#rJackwood_2013_a\">Jackwood & Wit, 2013</a>). The first case of IB in China dates back to early 1980s, and since then, the outbreaks were constantly emerging and numerous IBV strains were identified, of which strains in genotype GI-19 (refers to the QX-like or LX4) became predominant among chickens currently, although the QX strain was initially identified in 1996. Additionally, other genotypes of IBV, such as GI-1 (Mass), GI-7 (TW-I or TW-like), GI-13 (4/91-like), GI-16 (Q1-like) and GI-22 (YN-like and SAIBK-like), were also frequently detected in China (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHan_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rHan_et+al_2018_a\">Han et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\">Li et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLin_2017_a\" href=\"#rLin_2017_a\">Lin & Chen, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMo_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rMo_et+al_2013_a\">Mo et al, 2013</a>). Importantly, several novel IBV genotypes, including GI-28, GI-29 and GVII-1, were identified recently (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rChen_et+al_2017_a\">Chen et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJiang_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rJiang_et+al_2017_a\">Jiang et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMa_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rMa_et+al_2019_a\">Ma et al, 2019</a>). All these indicated that the IBV strains circulating in China are genetically diverse, providing a potential platform for recombination and greatly challenging the current biological control measures.",

            "Previous studies have demonstrated that the genotypes of IBV strains circulating in China are complex, and the GI-19 genotype has predominated in chickens since 2008 and spread all over the world in the next decade (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBande_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rBande_et+al_2017_a\">Bande et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHan_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rHan_et+al_2011_a\">Han et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2012_a\">Li et al, 2012</a>). GI-1 genotype vaccine H120 has been the most widely used vaccine in China until now, which shared a very low homology of identity with the emerging GI-19 strain HeN-1/China/2019 (32.2%) and HeN-2/China/2019 (32.2%) in glycoprotein S1 gene region, and even the other GI-19 strains identified recently. These results indicated the H120 vaccine could not provide effective protection against GI-19 genotype strains infection, which might explain the clinical phenomenon that a number of IBV outbreaks emerged in vaccinated flocks (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLin_2017_a\" href=\"#rLin_2017_a\">Lin & Chen, 2017</a>).",
            "As a highly variable coronavirus, numerous IBV variants have been identified and nucleotide substitutions or recombination between field strains and vaccines occurred frequently (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBande_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rBande_et+al_2017_a\">Bande et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJordan_2017_a\" href=\"#rJordan_2017_a\">Jordan, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLin_2017_a\" href=\"#rLin_2017_a\">Lin & Chen, 2017</a>; Sjaak de Wit et al, 2011). Similar to the previous studies, we discovered several recombinant events between GI-19 and other IBV genotypes with great possibilities. All these results indicated the GI-19 genotype strains were constantly evolving. In China, the genotype GI-19 vaccine QXL was just approved in the last year (data from the National Veterinary Drug Basic Information Database of China). The continuous emergence of IBV variants undoubtedly facilitates evading immune protection induced by vaccination, as well as adapting to new environment, which would greatly challenge the efficacy of the newly developed vaccine.",
            "Since the end of 2018, a large number of IBV outbreaks emerged in vaccinated commercial broilers and layers in China, indicating that the efficacy of currently used vaccines, including H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A, was not effective for the circulating GI-19 genotype.",
            "Fortunately, one live attenuated vaccine targeting GI-19 genotype has been licensed in 2018, which might provide an effective role in controlling the disease in China. The result also highlights the importance of further surveillance to define the variations and distribution of this virulent strain of IBV among the Chinese flocks, which helps to carry out proper preventive measures to limit its devastating effect for poultry industry.",
            "In conclusion, this study identified two virulent GI-19 IBV strains in IBV-vaccinated commercial broiler farm during the recent wave of IBV outbreaks in China. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these newly identified IBV strains are closely related to the ck/ China/I0529/17 strain. However, there are still some evolutionary distance between the newly identified IBV strains and other GI-19 strains and contain several special amino acid mutations in the HVR regions of S1 protein, suggesting that Chinese IBV strains constantly emerge and evolve towards different directions. This study provides an insight on recently emerging IBV outbreaks, which shows the need to carry out proper preventive measures and control strategies."
