        "abstract": "The burden of vector-borne diseases (Dengue, Zika virus, yellow fever, etc.) gradually increased in the past decade across the globe. Mathematical modelling on infectious diseases helps to study the transmission dynamics of the pathogens. Theoretically, the diseases can be controlled and eventually eradicated by maintaining the effective reproduction number, (${\\mathcal{R}}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$), strictly less than 1. We established a vector-host compartmental model, and derived (${\\mathcal{R}}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) for vector-borne diseases. The analytic form of the (${\\mathcal{R}}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) was found to be the product of the basic reproduction number and the geometric average of the susceptibilities of the host and vector populations. The (${\\mathcal{R}}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) formula was demonstrated to be consistent with the estimates of the 2015\u20132016 yellow fever outbreak in Luanda, and distinguished the second minor epidemic wave. For those using the compartmental model to study the vector-borne infectious disease epidemics, we further remark that it is important to be aware of whether one or two generations is considered for the transition \u201cfrom host to vector to host\u201d in reproduction number calculation.",

We formulated the analytic form of the effective reproduction number, Reff, with respect to the basic reproduction number, R0, and the susceptibilities of the vector (Sv) and host (Sh) for vector-borne diseases in Eq (5). The Reff from Eq (5) were compared with the Reff of the classic airborne infectious disease in Eq (1) as well as the estimation by the SI approach in Eq (7). We re-visited the yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Luanda, and used this epidemic as an example to compare the Reff calculation and estimation. Although there existed differences in the three Reff series during the first transmission wave around January 2016 in Fig. 2, the Reff values were roughly synchronised.

            "The burden of vector-borne diseases (Dengue, Zika virus, yellow fever, etc.) gradually increased in the past decade across the globe. Mathematical modelling on infectious diseases helps to study the transmission dynamics of the pathogens. Theoretically, the diseases can be controlled and eventually eradicated by maintaining the effective reproduction number, (Reff), strictly less than 1. We established a vector-host compartmental model, and derived (Reff) for vector-borne diseases. The analytic form of the (Reff) was found to be the product of the basic reproduction number and the geometric average of the susceptibilities of the host and vector populations. The (Reff) formula was demonstrated to be consistent with the estimates of the 2015\u20132016 yellow fever outbreak in Luanda, and distinguished the second minor epidemic wave. For those using the compartmental model to study the vector-borne infectious disease epidemics, we further remark that it is important to be aware of whether one or two generations is considered for the transition \u2018\u2018from host to vector to host\u2019\u2019 in reproduction number calculation.",

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "In this work, a simple epidemic model (2) is developed to study the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases. We formulated the analytic form of the effective reproduction number, Reff, with respect to the basic reproduction number, R0, and the susceptibilities of the vector (Sv) and host (Sh) for vector-borne diseases in Eq (5). The Reff from Eq (5) were compared with the Reff of the classic airborne infectious disease in Eq (1) as well as the estimation by the SI approach in Eq (7). We re-visited the yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Luanda, and used this epidemic as an example to compare the Reff calculation and estimation. Although there existed differences in the three Reff series during the first transmission wave around January 2016 in Fig. 2, the Reff values were roughly synchronised. However, for the second (minor) transmission wave around April 2016, the Reffs from Eq (5) were consistent with the estimates from the renewable equation that were significantly larger than 1, the \u2018\u2018 R0Sh\u2019\u2019 appeared inconsistent with the formers and lower than 1. According to theoretical epidemiology (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cEarn_et+al_2008_a\" href=\"#rEarn_et+al_2008_a\">Earn et al, 2008</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBrauer_2001_a\" href=\"#rBrauer_2001_a\">Brauer & Castillo-Chavez, 2001</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKeeling_2011_a\" href=\"#rKeeling_2011_a\">Keeling & Rohani, 2011</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGrenfell_et+al_1995_a\" href=\"#rGrenfell_et+al_1995_a\">Grenfell, Dobson & Moffatt, 1995</a>), the condition that Reff < 1 guarantees the disease under control. The R0Sh was calculated lower than 1 since the mid-February 2016, and this contradicted with the occurrence of the second YF epidemic wave in May. Therefore, the \u2018\u2018 R0Sh\u2019\u2019 form of effective reproduction number was demonstrated unqualified for measuring the transmissibility of a vector-borne",
            "\u221a disease. On the other hand, our derived Reff = R0 ShSv, Eq (5), matched the two waves of both YF incidences time series and the R(t ) estimates by renewable equation well.",
            "\u221a Different from the vector-free context, the Reff = R0 ShSv for the vector-borne diseases indicates that the disease control effectiveness, i.e., Reff, non-linearly depends on the control of the host\u2019s susceptibility, Sh. Figure 3 shows that the reduction in Sh is (relatively) less effective in reducing Reff during the initial stage, i.e., from 0% onwards, and becomes more effective when the cumulative reduction of Sh grows. This finding suggests that directly reducing R0, via, e.g., vector elimination, avoiding exposure to vectors, improving treatment, etc., could be a more efficient option to control the vector-borne diseases, especially when the herd protection in the host population is difficult to build up. Although the next generation matrix method in \u2018Basic Reproduction Number\u2019 is valid around a disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of model (2) (Van den Driessche & Watmough, 2002; Van den Driessche, 2017), the (asymptotic) stability of the endemic equilibrium (EE) will allow that the product of the R0 multiplying the susceptibility can be interpreted as Reff. The Bv (t ) can be treated as a constant, Bv , when we consider a sufficiently short period of time. Hence, during this short period of time, the EE of model (2) is asymptotically stable, and the Eq (5) holds. More precisely, Eq (5) follows a more general version as follows, Reff(t ) = R0(t ) Sh(t )Sv(t ).",
            "The global asymptotic stability (GAS) of EE can be further guaranteed as Nv = Bv (t ) \u2212 \u03bcv Nv = 0 in model (2), and this leads to the condition that Bv (t ) = Bv = \u03bcv Nv .",
            "This work used the serial interval (SI) approach, i.e., the renewable equation, to estimate the instantaneous effective reproduction number, R(t ), for further comparison. The estimates of R(t ) depended on the choice of the distribution of SI, i.e., the w(k) in Eq (7). Accounting for the initial susceptibility of 63% of the YF epidemic (WHO, 2017), <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2016_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2016_a\">Wu et al (2016</a></a>) estimated that the YF basic reproduction number of R0 = 8.3 (95% CI [6.8\u20139.7]) with mean SI of 23 days, and R0 = 11.3 (95% CI [8.7\u201313.8]) with mean SI of 32 days. Kraemer et al (2017) estimated that R0 = 7.6 (95% CI [6.3\u20138.9]) with mean SI 15 days. We adopted the mean SI of 23 days as in <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2016_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWu_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rWu_et+al_2016_a\">Wu et al (2016</a></a>) in this work to estimate the R(t ) series. Different (but reasonable) settings on SI will distinguish the second transmission wave (as highlighted in purple in Figs. 2C and 4) with Reff > 1 indifferently. In addition, we note that slight changes in the choice of YF SI will not affect our main results.",
            "This work intends to estimate and compare different forms of the time-varying effective reproduction number. We have adopted two different but widely used approaches, i.e., the maximal likelihood-based reconstruction and the SI, i.e., by the renewable equation, based estimation, which includes three different formations in Eqs. (1), (5) and (7). The maximum likelihood-based reconstruction method and the SI based estimation method are different in the calculation procedures and theoretical features. The maximum likelihood-based reconstruction relies on the mechanistic disease transmission model, e.g., model (2), and thus, it follows a biologically reasonable model structure. It is able to disentangle the changing dynamics of susceptibility, Sh(t ), and the basic reproduction number, R0(t ), based the number of cases time series and other reasonable epidemiological settings. Hence, we adopted this approach to find both Sh(t ) and R0(t ), and further calculate the Reff(t ) in two difference forms. The SI based (renewable equation based) estimation method is to calculate descriptive statistics by nature. By directly using the number of disease cases time series and the knowledge (distribution) of SI, the R(t ) can be estimated straightforwardly.",
            "To derive the Reff in Eq (5), we used the next generation matrix approach in \u2018Effective Reproduction Number\u2019 and considered the transition \u2018\u2018from host to vector to host\u2019\u2019 as two generations, which is consistent with (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGao_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rGao_et+al_2016_a\">Gao et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTang_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rTang_et+al_2016_a\">Tang et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhao_et+al_2018_b\" href=\"#rZhao_et+al_2018_b\">Zhao et al, 2018b</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChampagne_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rChampagne_et+al_2016_a\">Champagne et al, 2016</a>; d <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPinho_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rPinho_et+al_2010_a\">Pinho et al, 2010</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMusa_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rMusa_et+al_2019_a\">Musa et al, 2019</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWang_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rWang_et+al_2012_a\">Wang et al, 2012</a>). As also remarked in <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBrauer_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rBrauer_et+al_2016_a\">Brauer et al (2016</a>) and Van den Driessche (2017), some other studies treated the same transition \u2018\u2018from host to vector to host\u2019\u2019 as a single combined generation (Tennant & Recker, 2018; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChowell_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rChowell_et+al_2007_a\">Chowell et al, 2007</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKucharski_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rKucharski_et+al_2016_a\">Kucharski et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTowers_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rTowers_et+al_2016_a\">Towers et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMideo_2008_a\" href=\"#rMideo_2008_a\">Mideo & Day, 2008</a>). Although the two choices have the same threshold value and follow the same mathematical criteria to judge the stability of compartmental models, to be aware of their difference is crucial. We remark that if considering the aforementioned transition as a single generation, the basic reproduction number would be the square of the R0 in Eq (3). In this case, the effective reproduction number is Reff = R0ShSv. In our YF epidemic example, we demonstrated that the misuse of the Eq (1) is likely to cause misleading or contradictory outcomes in studying the vector-borne diseases outbreak. The two forms of the reproduction numbers have different biological interpretations due to the different definitions of generations, nevertheless one can be transformed to the other.",
            "\u221a Our modelling study, specially the derived \u2018\u2018 Reff = R0 ShSv\u2019\u2019 relationship, has limitations mainly due to the model settings and structures. As stated in the analysis parts, the relationship holds on the condition that the transmission paths remain from-hostto-vector and from-vector-to-host. Hence, when direct transmission occurs, e.g., sexual",

            "\u221a in scale, and thus Reff \u2248 R0 ShSv. The numerical results and estimates in this work are calculated with Sv = 1 fixed. This Sv = 1 is based on two facts that the vector\u2019s lifespan is much shorter than host\u2019s lifespan; and the infected vectors do not recover (for most of the vector-borne diseases). These two facts will lead to an outcome in model (2) that class Rv = 0 and class Iv is remarkably small and almost zero. As the matter of fact, Iv , i.e., the prevalence of disease in vectors, is likely to increase when the pathogen is extremely infectious and the vertical transmission accounts. Therefore, the surveillance on the disease prevalence in vectors would be helpful for calculating the Reff."

            "\u221a We formulate the analytic form of the Reff = R0 ShSv for the vector-borne diseases. We demonstrate the Reff formulation is consistent with the estimates of the 2015\u20132016 yellow fever outbreak in Luanda, and distinguishes the second minor epidemic wave significantly. We remark that it is important to be aware of whether one or two generations is considered for the transition \u2018\u2018from host to vector to host\u2019\u2019 in the infectious diseases modelling studies."

            "The percentage reduction in Sh can be defined as 1 minus the host susceptibility.",
            "The authors noted that both percentage reductions in Sh and R0 ranged from 0 to 1.",
            "The range of R0 from 2 to 10 covers most of the vector-borne diseases\u2019 basic reproduction numbers during the initial outbreak"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "A simple epidemic model (2) is developed to study the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases.",
            "For the second transmission wave around April 2016, the Reffs from Eq (5) were consistent with the estimates from the renewable equation that were significantly larger than 1, the \u2018\u2018 R0Sh\u2019\u2019 appeared inconsistent with the formers and lower than 1.",
            "The R0Sh was calculated lower than 1 since the mid-February 2016, and this contradicted with the occurrence of the second YF epidemic wave in May. the \u2018\u2018 R0Sh\u2019\u2019 form of effective reproduction number was demonstrated unqualified for measuring the transmissibility of a vector-borne"
