        "abstract": "This book is designed to provide all the information required for a sound understanding of diseases of the nose and paranasal sinuses and the surgical techniques used in their management. After an opening section on basic science, clinical and radiological assessment is explained and individual chapters focus on conditions ranging from infectious diseases, allergic rhinitis, and nasal polyposis to trauma, malignancies, and skin diseases. A wide variety of surgical techniques are then described with the aid of high-quality illustrations, covering nasal airway procedures and surgical approaches to the paranasal sinuses, including diverse endoscopic and image-guided procedures, nasal reconstruction, and endonasal and external rhinoplasty. The book is a collaborative project between the new generation of Turkish specialists and well-known experts from across the world. It will be of value for ENT doctors in all countries, as well as for students and trainees and those working in ENT-related fields such as maxillo-facial surgery, pediatrics, allergology, neurology, infectious diseases, and neurosurgery.",
