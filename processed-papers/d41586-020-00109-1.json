            "Scientists are increasingly concerned about a new virus that is spreading in Asia. As Nature went to press, Chinese officials had reported 291 cases nationwide, most in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began. Thailand, Japan and South Korea are among the nations that have reported infections. At least six people have died from the virus, which causes a respiratory illness.",
            "Chinese officials have also confirmed that the virus can spread from person to person, although the extent of such transmissibility is unclear. The surge in infections is alarming because of Chinese New Year this weekend, when hundreds of millions of people will travel to their home towns or overseas. \u201cThis could be the beginning of a disaster,\u201d says Seungtak Kim, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute Korea in Seongnam, South Korea.",
            "The illness was first detected last December among people who had visited a live-animal market in Wuhan. Scientists have identified the pathogen as a coronavirus, from the same family that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. As Nature went to press, the World Health Organization was set to meet on 22 January to decide whether to declare a public-health emergency over the virus."

            "Researchers in the Philippines are monitoring the Taal volcano closely for signs of a major eruption. The volcano\u2019s activity has eased since it began spewing steam and ash more than a week ago, but the threat of a large-scale eruption remains, say scientists. In addition to the immediate risk to life, such an event could contaminate water supplies and disrupt power generation for millions, and halt ground and air travel.",
            "At 2.30 p.m. local time on 12 January, Taal started ejecting lava and blew out a giant plume of rock fragments. Ash travelled as far north as Quezon City, some 70 kilometres away, forcing tens of thousands of people on Taal\u2019s Volcano Island and in nearby provinces to flee.",
            "The volcano\u2019s activity has stalled, but this does not mean the worst is over, says Mariton Bornas, a volcanologist at the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology just north of Manila.",
            "The volcano remains at level 4 on the country\u2019s volcano-alert system, the second-highest level, meaning a hazardous eruption could happen in hours or days."

            "The blazes raging across Australia have damaged lives, homes and businesses. They have also destroyed scientific equipment and derailed research.",
            "Remote-sensing specialist Will Woodgate at the University of Queensland in Brisbane manages a site in the Bago State Forest that gathers data on land surface conditions to feed into global climate models. As fire tore through the site on New Year\u2019s Eve, the data that have flowed from it for 20 years stopped. Photos suggest that the layer of vegetation under the forest canopy has been wiped out, although the canopy itself is intact. Woodgate says sensors at the top of a tower at the centre of the site could have survived.",
            "Elsewhere, the Australian Mountain Research Facility was set up last year by the Australian National University in Canberra to study how a changing climate affects alpine landscapes. It had planned to deploy sensors and monitoring equipment to its eight field sites in the Australian summer. But fire at one site has left \u201cnothing but bare soil\u201d, says soil scientist Zach Brown, the senior technical officer for the project. Installation of equipment across the network has been set back by a year, he says.",
            "Gases that deplete Earth\u2019s protective ozone layer could be responsible for up to half of the effects of climate change observed in the Arctic from 1955 to 2005.",
            "The finding, published on 20 January, could help to explain the disproportionate toll that climate change has taken on the region, an effect that has long puzzled scientists (L. M. Polvani et al Nature Clim. Change http:// doi.org/djt5; 2020). The Arctic is warming at more than twice the average rate of the rest of the globe \u2014 a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification \u2014 and it is losing sea ice at a staggering pace.",
            "Ozone-depleting substances, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), are known to heat the atmosphere more efficiently than carbon dioxide. But most research on these chemicals has focused on their effects on the ozone layer.",
            "A team of researchers compared climate simulations both with and without the mass emission of CFCs that began in the 1950s. Without CFCs, the simulations showed an average Arctic warming of 0.82 \u00b0C, but with CFCs, the number jumped to 1.59 \u00b0C.",
            "Replicating these results in multiple climate models will be crucial for improving estimates of how much responsibility CFCs bear for heating the Arctic, say researchers.",
