        "abstract": "Background: Respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses, initially infect the upper airways but can manifest as severe lower respiratory tract infections in high\u2010risk pa\u2010 tients with significant morbidity and mortality. For syndromic diagnosis, several mul\u2010 tiplex nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed for clinics, of which SureX 13 Respiratory Pathogen Multiplex Kit (ResP) can simultaneously detect 13 patho\u2010 gens directly from airway secretion specimens. The organisms identified are influenza virus A, influenza virus A pdmH1N1 (2009), influenza virus A H3N2, influenza virus B, adenovirus, boca virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syn\u2010 cytial virus, human metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia. Methods: This study provides performance evaluation data of this assay by compar\u2010 ing with pathogen\u2010specific PCRs from oropharyngeal swab samples. Results: Ten pathogens were detected in this assay, of which rhinovirus, adenovirus, and influenza virus A pdmH1N1 (2009) were the most common. The overall agree\u2010 ment between the ResP and the comparator tests was 93.8%. The ResP demonstrated 86.5% agreement for positive results and 97.8% agreement for negative results. Conclusion: The ResP assay demonstrated a highly concordant performance com\u2010 paring with pathogen\u2010specific PCRs for detection of respiratory pathogens in oro\u2010 pharyngeal swabs from outpatients and could aid in the diagnosis of respiratory infections in a variety of clinical scenarios.",

The symptoms caused by these pathogens are largely similar, thus definitive diagnosis requires effec\u2010 tive laboratory testing.

Consequential antimicrobial or antiviral therapy may thus be administrated promptly and appropriately.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Most importantly, the early diagnosis of influenza viruses, which are contagious, is beneficial for early isolation of pa\u2010 tients, thus reducing the spread of influenza viruses."

            "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are common and contribute signifi\u2010 cantly to morbidity and mortality. They are the leading causes of outpa\u2010 tient visits and hospitalizations in all age groups, especially for children under 5 years of age.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] Most ARIs in children and outpatients are caused by nine common respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A, influenza virus B, rhinovirus, adenovirus, para\u2010 influenza virus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and boca virus[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Additionally, atypical pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, are",

            "also major causes of ARIs in children. The symptoms caused by these pathogens are largely similar, thus definitive diagnosis requires effec\u2010 tive laboratory testing. By using multiplex assay targeting these patho\u2010 gens, early diagnosis can be made in a timely manner. Consequential antimicrobial or antiviral therapy may thus be administrated promptly and appropriately.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Most importantly, the early diagnosis of influenza viruses, which are contagious, is beneficial for early isolation of pa\u2010 tients, thus reducing the spread of influenza viruses.",
            "The routine clinical laboratory testing for respiratory viruses is largely conducted by direct fluorescent\u2010antibody assays and rapid antigen tests in China. Given the poor sensitivity and complicated manual operation, these methods have been gradually replaced by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), which are more sensitive and more specific. However, majority of the NAAT kits are based on real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can only de\u2010 tect one or two pathogens of ARIs within a single tube, thus are not syndromic testing.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] The clinical and economic impacts of syndromic testing for respiratory pathogens have been evaluated in several studies.

After sam\u2010 pling, specimens were kept in 4\u00b0C and transferred to the laboratory for testing within one week.",
            "The specimen was shaken vigorously for 5 minutes in phosphate\u2010 buffered saline solution, centrifuged at 9.6 g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was aspirated. About 50 \u03bcL of RNA was extracted from 140 \u03bcL supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacture's instruc\u2010 tion and was stored at \u221280\u00b0C.",
            "Influenza virus nucleic acid detection was performed by Influenza A/B Influenza Virus Nucleic Acid Detection Kit (Cat. No DA\u2010BN147, Daan Gene). Positive samples were further tested for influenza virus A pdmH1N1 (2009) and seasonal influenza virus H3N2 using a sepa\u2010 rate kit (Cat. No JC10209, Daan Gene). Both tests were carried out on ABI Quant Studio 7 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) accord\u2010 ing to the instructions. A typical S amplification curve and Cq value \u226435.0 were determined positive.",
            "For influenza virus\u2010negative samples, more PCR tests were per\u2010 formed to detect the following pathogens: adenovirus (ADV), bo\u2010 cavirus (BOV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), using corresponding NAAT kits from Daan Gene. All tests were carried out on ABI Quant Studio 7 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the instructions. A typical S amplification curve and Cq value \u226438.0 were determined positive.",

The PCR prod\u2010 uct was subjected to capillary electrophoresis using GenomeLabTM GeXP Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter) according to the instructions. Each pathogen, if detectable, produced a distinctive fragment size after PCR amplification. The results of fragment anal\u2010 ysis were used to determine the outcomes of testing. In brief, if the peak height of a targeted fragment size is lower than the lower peak of the signal standard, the targeted pathogen is determined nega\u2010 tive; if the peak height of a targeted fragment size is higher than the higher peak of the signal standard, the targeted pathogen is determined positive; if the peak height of a targeted fragment size is between the higher and the lower peaks of the signal standard, the targeted pathogen is determined uncertain and the test should be repeated.",
