        "abstract": "Recently, a novel coronavirus (SARS\u2010COV\u20102) emerged which is responsible for the recent outbreak in Wuhan, China. Genetically, it is closely related to SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV. The situation is getting worse and worse, therefore, there is an urgent need for designing a suitable peptide vaccine component against the SARS\u2010COV\u20102. Here, we characterized spike glycoprotein to obtain immunogenic epitopes. Next, we chose 13 Major Histocompatibility Complex\u2010(MHC) I and 3 MHC\u2010II epitopes, having antigenic properties. These epitopes are usually linked to specific linkers to build vaccine components and molecularly dock on toll\u2010like receptor\u20105 to get binding affinity. Therefore, to provide a fast immunogenic profile of these epitopes, we performed immunoinformatics analysis so that the rapid development of the vaccine might bring this disastrous situation to the end earlier.",
