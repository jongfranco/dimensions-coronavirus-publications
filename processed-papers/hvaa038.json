A proportion of the earlier cases were associated with a seafood market in the city, where exotic animals were also sold for food (1). Since then, this illness has been shown to be caused by a novel coronavirus (nCoV) that is provisionally named 2019-nCoV. As of February 1, 2020, the disease has been confirmed in over 12,000 cases, with 259 deaths. Geographically, the disease has spread beyond China to over 20 other countries.",

            "The sensitive and specific detection of this virus is an important part of the global healthcare response to this outbreak. In this issue of the Journal, Chu et al reported the development of two one-step real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for detecting 2019-nCoV (2). The two assays target the Orf1b and the N region of the viral genome. Due to the relative paucity of positive control materials when the authors developed these assays, the authors had designed the primers and probes such that they would also cross-react with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV. The authors then use SARS-CoV as one of their positive controls. The authors argued that this cross-reactivity would not cause any diagnostic ambiguity as SARS-CoV was no longer seen clinically following the resolution of the SARS epidemic in 2004.",
            "The authors found that the N assay was more sensitive than that targeting the Orf1b. The authors proposed using the former as a screening assay, and the latter as a diagnostic assay. On the basis of the data presented by the authors, one can perhaps argue that this two-tier test arrangement should be considered provisional. Further validation of this approach using a much larger sample cohort would be necessary."
