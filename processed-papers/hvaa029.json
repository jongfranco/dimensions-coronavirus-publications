        "abstract": "Background\n                  A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients.\n               \n               \n                  Methods\n                  We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10\u22124-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.",

            "PRIMER AND PROBE SEQUENCES<br/><br/>Two monoplex real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the ORF1b and N gene regions of 2019-nCoV were designed based on the first publicly available sequence in Genbank (Accession number: MN908947). The downloaded sequence and those for SARS coronavirus, bat SARS-like coronaviruses, and other representative coronaviruses were edited and aligned. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences were performed using the neighbor joining method in MEGA X [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Two sequence regions (ORF1b and N) that are highly conserved amongst sarbecoviruses were selected for primer and probe designs.

            "Coronaviruses can be classified into 4 genera (a, b, c, and d) and these viruses are detected in a wide range of animal species, including humans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. There are 6 previously known human coronaviruses that can be transmitted between humans. Human alphacoronaviruses, 229E and NL63, and betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1, are common respiratory viruses usually causing mild upper respiratory diseases. In contrast to these, the other 2 human beta-coronaviruses, SARS and MERS coronaviruses, are highly pathogenic in humans. The case fatality rates of SARS and MERS are about 10% and 35%, respectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. SARS and MERS can be transmitted between humans and may cause major outbreaks in health care settings or in community settings. Both SARS and MERS coronaviruses are of zoonotic origins. MERS coronavirus is widely circulated in dromedary camels. Over 90% of dromedary camels in Middle East countries are seropositive for MERS coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Because of such a high prevalence in this animal species, sporadic zoonotic transmissions of MERS coronavirus from camels to humans have been repeatedly detected in the affected region since its discovery in 2012. For the SARS outbreak in 2003, exotic mammals in wet markets, such as palm civets and raccoon dogs, are believed to be the animal sources of the virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. The detection of SARS coronavirus in these species led to a temporary ban of selling of these animals in 2004, thereby preventing additional spill-over events from animals to humans. But further surveillance studies indicated that these animals are rarely positive for SARS coronavirus in non-market settings, suggesting that they only served as intermediate hosts in the SARS event [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Subsequent virus surveillances in wild animals identified a vast number of coronaviruses in bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Interestingly, several bat coronaviruses that are genetically similar to human SARS coronavirus were detected in horseshoe bats. This group of SARS-like bat coronaviruses, together with SARS coronavirus, form a unique clade under the subgenus Sarbecovirus. It is now generally believed that SARS coronavirus is a recombinant virus between several bat SARS-like beta-coronaviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Some of these bat coronaviruses are experimentally capable of infecting human cells in cultures [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], suggesting that these animal viruses and their recombinants can pose threats to human health."
