        "abstract": "Calf diarrhea causes severe economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide. This study investigated the prevalence of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine norovirus (BNoV), bovine group A rotavirus (BoRVA), and bovine torovirus (BToV) in calves aged \u2264 60 days, regardless of diarrhea, across nine different regions in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and reported associations between these viruses and diarrhea. Fecal samples were collected rectally from 689 calves: normal (n = 360) and diarrheic (n = 329). BNoV (84/689, 12.2%) was the most prevalent regardless of diarrhea, followed by BCoV (37/689, 5.4%), BToV (15/689, 2.2%), and BoRVA (13/689, 1.9%). Although BCoV (P = 0.032) and BoRVA (P = 0.007) were significantly associated with diarrhea in pre-weaned calves, BNoV and BToV showed no association. Infection by the four pathogens had no relationship with calf age; BoRVA was detected only in calves aged < 30 days, but this finding was not statistically significant. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BCoV isolates obtained in this study were distinct from the other known BCoVs, and all BNoV isolates belonged to GIII.2 genotype; genetic variations in BNoVs are present in the ROK. BoRVA isolates distributed in the ROK were assigned to G6P[5]. Within the P[5] genotype, our isolates were divided into two lineages: P[5]-III and P[5]-VIII. P[5]- VIII lineage was dominant in pre-weaned Korean native calves. Our BToV isolates were more closely related to a European isolate, B145, than to Japanese isolates. Here, BNoV was frequently identified in calves, suggesting its non-significant contribution to calf diarrhea, whereas BCoV and BoRVA were responsible for calf diarrhea in the ROK. Consequently, our results highlight the importance of rapid diagnosis against these viruses in calf diarrhea.",

Based on chi-squared analysis, BCoV was more frequently detected in diarrheic feces (P = 0.032) than in normal feces. The prevalence of BoRVA was significantly associated with diarrhea (P = 0.007). The detection rate of BoRVA was 5.5-fold higher in diarrheic calves than that in healthy calves. BNoV or BToV was detected in the feces of pre-weaned calves regardless of diarrhea.

BNoV alone was identified in Anseong farm, which was cleaner and more spacious than the other farms (Table 2). It is speculated that norovirus is a zoonotic pathogen; thus, it is transmitted to calves through humans. According to our results, BNoV had an infection rate of \u2265 10%, except in the Gimje farm (Table 2).

Moreover, BNoV prevalence was higher in calves aged 1\u201310 days and gradually decreased with age (Table 5). We found no correlation between BCoV and calf age. BNoV occurred as a co-infection with BCoV or BToV, but not with BoRVA. Owing to few coinfection samples, it was not possible to demonstrate that those viruses were associated with diarrhea.

Here, the prevalence of BoRVA was considerably higher in diarrheic feces than that in normal feces. The present study revealed that BoRVA infection was significantly associated with diarrhea. BoRVA infection was observed only in calves aged < 30 days, indicating that BoRVA causes diarrhea in young animals. Here, the prevalence of BoRVA was very low, whether the infection rate of BoRVA is originally low or whether it varies according to different groups of rotaviruses, such as group B and group C, remains unclear to date.

Another possibility is that vaccination for BoRVA has been well implemented in the ROK, which has caused a reduction in BoRVA infection rate among calves. This reflects the importance of vaccination. Several reports have indicated that the most prevalent genotypes of BoRVA are G6, G8, and G10 in combination with P[1], P[5], P[7], and P[11], with G6P[5] being the most prevalent in cattle among several countries (Alfieri et al 2004; Fig. 4 A phylogenetic tree of the S gene of BToV strains/isolates and Korean isolates constructed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA6.

This could be attributed to the different sample collection regions and the different target genes used for detecting BToV as well as calf age. BToV infection was high in Mungyeong farm compared with the other farms. The pathogens detected varied according to the farms from which samples were collected (Table 2), likely owing to the difference in hygiene levels and management systems in farms.

Here, BToV was found only in co-infections with BCoVor BNoV (Table 4), and these co-infections did not cause diarrhea. To date, there is little available information regarding BToV infection causing diarrhea in the ROK. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that our isolates were more closely related to Japanese strains than to the Breda 1 strain (Fig. 4). Although BToV infection has been reported in the ROK, owing to differences in the target gene, we could not reveal genetic diversity between the isolates identified in this study and the previously reported Korean isolates.

The prevalence of BCoV, BNoV, BoRVA, and BToV was not significantly associated with calf age. The association of BNoV and BToV with the pathogenesis of diarrhea in pre-weaned calves remains inconclusive. Therefore, monitoring and surveillance of BCoV and BoRVA in cattle populations are recommended for preventing and controlling diarrhea in calves."
