            "As The Lancet Infectious Diseases went to press, the situation with the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China, continued to rapidly evolve. As of 9 February 2020, China had confirmed 37 251 cases of COVID-19, an increase of 2657 since the previous day. 6188 of these cases were severe and there had been 812 deaths. Every region of the country has been affected. 24 other nations have reported 307 cases and one death. On Jan 30, 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a public health emergency of inter\u00ad national concern (PHEIC). \u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it\u201d, explained WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom.",
            "There are suggestions from some quarters that COVID-19 is on the verge of becoming a pandemic, the relatively small number of reported cases outside China notwithstanding. The first cases were linked to a live animal and seafood, or so-called \u201cwet\u201d, market in Wuhan, Hubei province, which was quickly closed down. A modelling study published in The Lancet on Jan 31 estimated that, on average, every infected individual is infecting 2\u00b768 additional individuals. The researchers posited that as of jan 25, Wuhan would have seen 75 815 infections with the novel coronavirus."

            "On Feb 5, government officials from the governorate of Mpoti, in Central Mali, reported seven deaths from cases with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. Cases were first detected at the end of January in the village of Samoa, health district of K\u00e9ra. On Feb 1, there were 14 cases detected with five deaths already having taken place. The remaining nine cases were taken to health centres where a further two cases died from their illness. The disease is a tick-borne virus from the Bunyaviridae family of viruses and infection spreads through the bite of infected ticks to animal or humans. Contact with infected animal blood can infect humans."

Most cases (75%) have been reported in the Asuncion and Central departments and all neighbourhoods of the capital have registered notifications of suspected cases. There are currently two circulating serotypes: DENV-2 and DENV-4, with DENV-4 being the predominant serotype. The cases so far in this year are three times the number of cases reported overall in 2019 (11 811)."

The isolated strain from the case in Kinshasa is genetically linked to a circulating strain Angola; this is the first case in Kinshasa."

There are more cases amongst males (n=4167), wth the most affected age group being those aged 20 to 39.
