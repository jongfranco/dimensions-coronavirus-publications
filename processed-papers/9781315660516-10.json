            "In Chapter 10, Younggeun Kwon elucidates the evolutionary pattern of South Korea\u2019s defense policy, delineating two persistent contending issues: dependence versus autonomy, dichotomy related to the ROK alliance and the force and command structure of a unified armed forces (defense unification under the army) versus an integrated armed force (equality of each armed service and close cooperation and coordination among the three armed services). Kwon argues that South Korea\u2019s efforts to enhance autonomy through the pursuit of self-reliant defense after the end of the Cold War was severely undermined by the army\u2019s campaign to seek defense unification. This was a sharp contrast to the Cold War situation in which the self-reliant defense posture was enhanced, blocking defense unification. During the post-Cold War period, however, defense unification efforts were reinforced, deepening the ROK\u2019s dependency on the US. Kwon attributes this phenomenon to the South Korean\u2019s threat perception. Consequently, South Korea has been suffering from a constant state of waning combat readiness and its dependence on the US."
