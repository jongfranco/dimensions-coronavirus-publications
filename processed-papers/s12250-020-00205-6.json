Activation of the RAS cascade involves Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to generate Ang I, which is then converted to Ang II by ACE. Ang II binds to its receptors (AT1 and AT2) to exert local and systemic effects such as vasoconstriction and promotion of the release of aldosterone. ACE2 functions as a counter-regulatory enzyme for balancing responses initiated from ACE. ACE2 hydrolyses Ang I and Ang II to generate Ang-(1\u20139) and Ang-(1\u20137). Ang-(1\u20137) binding to the MAS receptor antagonizes Ang II-mediated actions. SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV use ACE2 as the entry receptor. Inhibition of ACE2 expression or downregulation of surface ACE2 by these coronaviruses may disrupt function balances between ACE/ACE2, which may be alleviated by different approaches (from A to D)"

ACE2 is one of the central enzymes in the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDonoghue_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rDonoghue_et+al_2000_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDonoghue_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rDonoghue_et+al_2000_a\">Donoghue et al 2000</a></a>; Imai et al 2010; Tipnis et al 2000) that regulates blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte balance, and systemic vascular resistance (Paul et al 2006; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZimmerman_1997_a\" href=\"#rZimmerman_1997_a\">Zimmerman and Dunham 1997</a>).",
            "In the lungs, activation of local pulmonary RAS can affect the pathogenesis of lung injury via multiple mechanisms, such as an increase in vascular permeability and alterations of alveolar epithelial cells (Kuba et al 2006; Specks et al 1990). Activation of pulmonary RAS involves renin, the initial enzyme of the RAS activation cascade (Fig. 1). Renin cleaves angiotensinogen, a globular protein, to generate angiotensin I (Ang I, a decapeptide hormone). The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) then converts Ang I to angiotensin II (Ang II, an octapeptide hormone). Ang II exerts vasoactive effects through binding to its receptors, the angiotensin II type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) receptors."

            "There are several potential therapeutic approaches that may be tested or developed (Fig. 1). First, therapies to increase ACE2 expression may be developed in the future, through direct injection of recombinant ACE2 protein, which has been shown to protect mice from severe acute lung injury (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cImai_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rImai_et+al_2005_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cImai_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rImai_et+al_2005_a\">Imai et al 2005</a></a>), and by delivering therapeutic vectors expressing high levels of ACE2 directly into lung tissues to overcome virus-induced ACE2 deficiency. Second, certain ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril may be used to balance the ACE/ACE2 function. In addition, therapeutic Ang-(1\u20137) heptapeptide may be delivered to activate its receptor MAS and to counteract the activities of Ang II. Furthermore, drugs blocking Ang II receptors may also be tested. In particular, the type I, but not type II, Ang II receptor has been shown to promote disease pathogenesis by inducing lung oedemas and impairing lung function (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cImai_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rImai_et+al_2005_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cImai_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rImai_et+al_2005_a\">Imai et al 2005</a></a>). Thus, a type I Ang II receptor blocker such as losartan could be tested for alleviating 2019-nCoVinduced lung injury.",
            "In sum, at present, there are no effective drugs for the treatment of 2019-nCoV-induced lung injury, which can often lead to lethal lung failure in patients. This perspective is intended to stimulate discussions about possible pathogenic mechanisms, based on the interaction of the virus with its receptor ACE2, so that rational therapies can be developed. Although ACE is regarded as the primary Ang II-converting enzyme, another enzyme, chymase, is also involved in converting Ang II in certain pathological conditions that may need attention (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFyhrquist_2008_a\" href=\"#rFyhrquist_2008_a\">Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa 2008</a>; Lindberg et al 1997). In addition, coronavirus pathogenesis is a highly complex process (Lo et al 2006), and much of the needed detail in host\u2013pathogen interaction in 2019-nCoV infection awaits investigation. It also remains to be clinically tested whether some of these potential treatments, as proposed here, can be effective or beneficial in the management of 2019-nCoV-induced lung injury."

    "headline": "Injection of SARS-CoV spike protein into mice led to a significant increase in Ang II levels in the lung tissue and exacerbated acid-induced acute lung injury. Results from these previous animal studies suggested a possible mechanism of how SARSCoV infection may cause severe lung failure, which is likely mediated through high levels of Ang II resulting from the inhibition of ACE2 by the viral spike protein",
