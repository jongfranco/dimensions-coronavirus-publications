            "Unknown. Snakes have been implicated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], but the evidence for this is weak, and genetic analysis suggests a mammalian source such as bats. Coronaviruses arising from bats can have intermediary animal hosts.",
            "China (540 cases) Thailand (4 cases) Vietnam (2 cases) South Korea (1 case) Japan (1 case) Taiwan (1 case) Singapore (1 case) Hong Kong (1 case) Philippines (1 case) USA (1 case)"
        ],
        "Clinical features": [
            "Fever, cough, shortness of breath, myalgia. Mild cases may present with a common cold like syndrome, whilst severe cases may develop severe acute respiratory syndrome and pneumonia.",
            "Coronaviruses are respiratory viruses, so can be found in the respiratory tract. Transmission is unknown yet and detailed risk factor analysis data have not yet been published. Most cases appear to be sporadic and are assumed to be from an animal source, with most cases localised to Wuhan and the initial outbreak linked to a fish market with other live animals. There has been some person to person spread, including a family in Guandoing, and a single case which infected 14 health workers. One of the two cases in Vietnam also appears to be spread person-to-person from the index case in Vietnam. SARS was transmitted person-to-person, especially in the hospital setting. MERS CoV has mostly been sporadic, with some person-to-person spread and nosocomial outbreaks."
        ],
        "Demographics of cases": [
            "All cases are adults, with males and females equally affected. Anecdotal reports that people with chronic conditions are more at risk. No cases have been reported in children at this stage. The majority of the cases are in China, mainly in Wuhan.",
            "Ranges from 2-3% depending on changes in daily case and death counts.",
            "Complications Severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, death."
        ],
        "Available prevention": [
            "A vaccine is being developed by the National Institutes for Health in the USA and by other companies. A MERS CoV vaccine has been developed[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and is a high priority for the WHO and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Initiatives. Whether the MERS vaccine has cross protection against 2019nCoV is unknown."
        ],
        "Available treatment": [
            "Supportive treatment only. Intensive care, ventilation and ECMO may be used for severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Broad spectrum antivirals may have effectiveness against coronaviruses but are untested against 2019nCoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]"
        ],
        "Comparison with past outbreaks": [
            "This is a new infection, so it can only be compared with SARS and MERS CoV.",
            "It appears less infectious than SARS, which had a R0 of 2. It may be closer to MERS CoV, which has a R0 close to 1, in terms of transmission. In terms of case fatality rate (CFR), the CFR with SARS was 12%, MERS CoV 26% and 2019nCoV appears to be about 2-3% based on informal reports of cases and deaths.",
            "The transmission appears mixed (like MERS CoV), with mostly sporadic or point-source cases and some propagated transmission from person to person. With SARS, travel-related cases in other countries frequently caused satellite epidemics with clear person to person transmission in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore and Canada. This has not been seen so far with the new coronavirus. With MERS, the only outbreak outside of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was in South Korea, and over 60% of cases are sporadic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]"
        ],
        "Unusual features": [
            "The source of infection remains unknown, although it is geographically in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China.",
            "Transmission appears mainly point-source in the city of Wuhan, particularly linked to a seafood market which also sells other live animals. There has been some person-to-person spread, but like MERS CoV, most travel related cases imported to other countries have not caused satellite epidemics.",
            "China took the extraordinary measure of locking down Wuhan and other cities on January 23rd 2020, thereby reducing travel out of the disease epicentre. Given the timing of this epidemic around the Chinese Lunar New Year (Spring festival), when travel is at a peak, this would reduce the risk of travel-related importations of cases to other parts of China and the world.",
            "The phylogenetic analysis suggests low diversity (ie that the virus is not mutating rapidly) and a relatively recent origin of the virus.",
            "1. What is the source? Identifying the source can help curtail the epidemic.",
            "2. What is the dominant mode of transmission and what other modes of transmission are possible? This will inform optimal disease control strategies.",
            "3. What are the risk factors for disease? A case-control analysis is required to determine sociodemographic, clinical, behavioural and other risk factors.",
            "A modelling study suggests that, based on the number of travel-related cases, there could be 1000 to 9000 undetected cases of 2019nCoV. [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. A similar modelling estimation of a large proportion of undetected, asymptomatic or mild cases was made for MERS CoV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] but not supported by active screening studies or serological surveys of humans in affected areas.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Serological surveys in Wuhan will help determine how much mild or asymptomatic infection there may be."
