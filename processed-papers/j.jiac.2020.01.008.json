            "In summary, compared with traditional virus detection methods, the advantages of dual UNDP-PCR are mainly reflected in the following aspects: first of all, compared with viral isolation and identification method and other serological methods, this method does not require cell culture and antibody production, saving testing costs and labor. Secondly, compared with the duplex RT-PCR technology, real-time RT-PCR and other molecular biology methods, dual UNDP-PCR saves detection time and testing costs by eliminating the need for process of viral nucleic acid extraction, purification and reverse transcription. Thirdly, based on the two kinds of special gold nanoparticles and functionalized magnetic beads, dual UNDP-PCR allows simultaneous preclinical testing of TGEV and PEDV in low-dose viral stool samples and distinguishes each other in one test, which is more convenient and quick than the single UNDP-PCR assay established previously. In addition, the experimental results show that the method can detect 25 copies/g of TGEV and PEDV with 400 times the sensitivity of traditional duplex RT-PCR. Finally, in terms of its specificity, specific nucleic acid probes for labeling magnetic particles and DNA labels for modifying nano-gold particles are two completely different specific sequences designed based on the conserved region of the viral gene, and by evaluating their ability to capture viral nucleic acids optimized screening for specificity. In the clinical sample application, the detection technology established in this study can easily identify whether it is pure PEDV or TGEV infection or mixed infection, which provides a basis for clinical medication and early control of infection to reduce the economic loss of pig farms.",
            "In conclusion, the dual UNDP-PCR assay established in this study allows simultaneous detection of TGEV and PEDV in large-scale fecal samples in the same reaction system without the need for viral nucleic acid extraction, purification and reverse transcription. This method can markedly improve the current detection technological ability in preclinical phase, achieving early diagnosis and early prevention, thus reducing the morbidity and mortality of TGE and PED in newborn piglets. In summary, dual UNDP-PCR is a fast and economical assay with high specificity, sensitivity and repeatability."

            "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are the main pathogens causing viral diarrhea in pig, mixed infections of these two viruses are very common in intensive pig rearing. However, there is a lack of a method to simultaneously detect and distinguish PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels. In this study, we aimed to establish a dual ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay (dual UNDP-PCR) based on functionalized magnetic bead enrichment and specific nano-technology amplification for simultaneous detection and distinguish diagnosis of PEDV and TGEV. The detection limit of dual UNDP-PCR for single or multiple infections of PEDV and TGEV is 25 copies/g, which is 400 times more sensitive than the currently known duplex RT-PCR, showing better specificity and sensitivity without cross-reaction with other viruses. For pre-clinical fecal samples, the dual UNDPPCR showed a markedly higher positive detection rate (52.08%) than conventional duplex RT-PCR (13.21%), can rapidly and accurately identify targeted pathogens whenever simple virus infection or co-infection. In summary, this study provides a technique for detecting and distinguishing PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels, which is high sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, low cost and broad application prospect."
