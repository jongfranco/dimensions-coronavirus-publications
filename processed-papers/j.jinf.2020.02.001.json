            "Dear Editor, Recently, Wang and colleagues reported in this journal the new threat of novel SARS-like coronavirus in China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] During the last several decades, humans had been affected by six human coronaviruses (HCoV)\u2014HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoVOC43, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)\u2014 the last two of which caused severe respiratory symptoms and human death on a globe scale.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] On December 2019, a human case in Wuhan, China infected with novel human coronavirus (HCoV) was first reported, who exhibited fever, difficulty with breathing, and invasive lesions in the lungs. This novel HCoV was subsequently designated as 2019-nCoV by World Health Organization (WHO). As of 4, February 2020, a total of 20,520 human cases (of which 426 fatal) of pneumonia infected with the 2019-nCoV had been demonstrated in all of the provinces of China (Fig. 1), with fatality rate of \u223c5% in Wuhan and \u223c0.8% in the rest of cities of China, respectively. Strikingly, the 2019-nCoV had caused family case clusters and sustained human-to-human transmission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] On January 30, 2020, WHO declared the 2019-nCoV epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (https://www.who.int), posing a new public health concern.",
            "The emergence of novel 2019-nCoV highlights the necessity of tracing the origin of virus and the updated prevention and control systems in order to avert outbreaks. We found that the genomes of the novel 2019-nCoV were genetically closely related to beta SARSrelated CoV (SARSr-CoV) circulating in China and had undergone genetic recombination with SARSr-CoV (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figure S1-S3). The overall genome identity of the 2019-nCoV and SARSr-CoV was ranging from 82% to 89%. With rapid dissemination of the 2019-nCoV, the viruses had been transmitted rapidly in more than 25 countries, and a steep increase in human infection with the 2019-nCoV occurred in China (Fig. 1). To further explore the genetic evolution of the 2019-nCoV, phylogenic relationships of 31 isolates examined in this study were explored and divided into four genotypes, including G1, G2, G3, and G4. We found that 25 isolates clustered together and had been circulating in Thailand and multiple provinces (e.g. Taiwan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Hubei) of China, suggestive of the ongoing co-circulation of the viruses. The 2019-nCoV circulating in USA and Wuhan, China clustered into an independent cluster. However, interestingly, the SZTH-002, 20SF013, and SZTH-001 strains in Guangdong province were located at basal branch of the 2019-nCoV (Fig. 2), indicative of a single origin. The genetic diversity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the 2019-nCoV was very small (Supplementary Figure S1). By contrast, the Spike (S) genes of some 2019-nCoV prevailing in Guangdong province were found at the root of the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan (Supplementary Figure S2). These findings indicated that the 2019-nCoV were infected from different regions in Wuhan and had been undergoing continuous evolution and dissemination in different regions. Compared with the rapid mutation of the influenza A viruses, the degree of diversification of the 2019-nCoV was much smaller. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out if the 2019-nCoV continue evolving to become more transmissible and virulent in humans in the near future."
