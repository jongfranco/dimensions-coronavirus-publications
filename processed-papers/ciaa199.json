Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples.\n               \n               \n                  Results\n                  Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days.\n               \n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the\u00a0cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.",

We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade IIIA hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. Results. Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. Conclusions. Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results. Keywords.

            "Laboratory findings of patients infected with COVID-19 The white blood cell (WBC) count of 36 patients (45.00%) was lower than the normal range (4 \u00d7 109/L), and 26 patients (32.50%) had lymphocytopenia (the lymphocyte count was less than 1.0 \u00d7109/L). 11 patients (13.75%) had platelets lower than the normal range (125 \u00d7109/L), and no patients had platelets higher than the normal range (350 \u00d7109/L). There were 62 patients (77.50%) with high C-reactive protein (CRP) and 59 patients (73.75%) with high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Only 1 patient (1.25%) had elevated procalcitonin (PCT) level.",
            "In terms of liver function, only 3 patients (3.75%) showed alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) above the normal range. Two patients (2.50%) had lower albumin level than the normal range (35 g/L). 18 patients (22.50%) had abnormal myocardial enzyme spectrum, indicating the increase of creatine kinase (CK). The level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased in 17 patients (21.25%). Two patients (2.50%) had different degrees of renal function damage, one of them had serious renal function damage (UREA: 26.5 mmol/L, CREA: 1054.4 mmol/L). The blood glucose (GLU) level of 19 patients (23.17%) exceeded the normal range (5.9 mmol/L). The level of D-dimer was increased in 3 patients (3.75%). Nine kinds of respiratory pathogens and influenza A and B nucleic acids were examined in all patients, and bacteria and fungi were cultured simutaneously. The results showed that all patients were negative for the pathogens above (Table 2).",
            "Imaging features of patients infected with COVID-19 Of the 80 patients, 55 (68.75%) showed abnormal chest CT images, consisting 36 cases (45.00%) of bilateral pneumonia and 19 cases (23.75%) of unilateral pneumonia (Table 1). There were no bilateral lobular and subsegmental consolidation areas, bilateral ground glass shadows or subsegmental consolidation areas, only bilateral ground glass opacity (Figure 2A)",
            "and unilateral ground glass opacity (Figure 2B). 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs (Figure 2C).",
            "Treatment for patients infected with COVID-19 All patients were treated empirically with a single antibiotic, mainly moxifloxacin. The duration of antibiotic treatment was 3-12 days (median 7 days [IQR4-9]). All patients received ribavirin antiviral therapy for 3-12 days (median 7 days [IQR3-10]). 12 patients (14.63%) also received methylprednisolone sodium succinate or methylprednisolone for 3-12 days (median 5 days [IQR3-8]). 35 patients (43.75%) were managed with non-invasive ventilator (ie, face mask). No patient used invasive ventilator. One patient was supported with hemodialysis. In addition, three patients used traditional Chinese medicine (Jian Wei Xiao Shi oral liquid and Xi Yan Ping) to improve their gastrointestinal function.",
            "The prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV Up to February 14, 21 of the 80 patients (23.75%) were discharged from the hospital. The average length of stay of discharged patients was 8 days. All other patients were still in the hospital for treatment, and no patient died. Discharge standard reference: body temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days, respiratory symptoms improved significantly, and respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test was negative for two consecutive times (sampling interval at least 1 day)."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "In this multi-center and multi-sample study, 80 cases infected with COVID-19 in Yancheng and Wuxi were reported. All patients were imported infections. Most of them received timely diagnosis and treatment as the government formulated an efficient early warning and isolation program in time. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. This report provided the latest information of infected patients in two cities of Jiangsu Province.",
            "COVID-19 was mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] At present, patients with COVID-19 are the main source of infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] What\u2019s more remarkable is that asymptomatic infections can also be a source of infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] The two cities mentioned in this study, Wuxi and Yancheng, are respectively located in the South and North of Jiangsu Province, and they are representative in population, economic level and traffic level.",
            "Compared with the results of the two studies on Wuhan cases by Chen et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] and Huang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], we found that the gender proportion was equal in the 80 patients we included, contradicting to the conclusion that men were more susceptible than women. This may be related to the insufficient number of samples in all these three studies. The results may also be influenced by the spreading mode of the disease, as five cases of intrafamilial transmission were included in this study. The age distribution of the patients was consistent with the study by Huang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>].",
            "In terms of clinical classification, 3 patients had severe pneumonia, and 77 patients had mild or moderate symptoms. These imported cases were timely diagnosed and treated in Jiangsu Province. Since most of the cases in this study were mild, the main symptoms were fever and cough. 10 patients had acute respiratory injury, 2 patients had renal injury, and no other organ damage was found.",
            "In terms of laboratory tests, nearly half of the patients had a decreased number of WBC and one third of the patients had a decreased number of lymphocytes. In most patients, CRP level was elevated, but PCT level was normal. All these changes further illustrated that COVID-19 may exert a major impact on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. The virus spreads and invades through respiratory mucosa, triggers a series of immune responses and induces cytokine storm in vivo, resulting in changes in immune components such as peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] Therefore, intravenous immunoglobulins were used in most patients with decreased WBC and lymphocyte levels.",
            "It has been reported that patients with COVID-19 infection are prone to exhibit liver dysfunction, and the potential mechanism is that COVID-19 may directly bind to ACE2 positive bile duct cells.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] It is suggested that the liver abnormality of SARS and COVID-19 patients may not be caused by liver cell damage, but by bile duct cell dysfunction and other reasons. In our study, 3 patients had abnormal ALT and AST, and 2 patients had decreased protein level. In addition, 19 patients had elevated GLU level, and 18 patients had abnormal muscle zymogram.",
            "In this study, all cases were confirmed by nucleic acid test. The sum of nucleic acid tests prior to a positive diagnosis for each patient was analyzed. Notably, 9 patients passed three tests before they got positive results. Therefore, we consider that if the suspected cases are excluded based on two consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results (the sampling time is at least one day apart), about 10% of the infected patients will be missed.",
            "Chest imaging is of great significance for the diagnosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] In the early stage, there were multiple mottling and interstitial changes, especially in the peripheral portion. In severe cases, lung consolidation can occur, but pleural effusion was rare. In the case reports of Wuhan, CT images of all patients were abnormal. 98% of the patients had bilateral involvement. However, in our study, the abnormal rate was relatively lower; 55 patients (68.75%) showed abnormal chest CT images, 36 (45.00%) showed bilateral pneumonia, 19 (23.75%) showed unilateral pneumonia. 25 cases had no abnormality on the first CT, and 23 of them had been diagnosed for more than 4 days. In this regard, we suggest that when screening patients, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination and chest imaging should be combined for comprehensive analysis.",
            "Up to now, there is no specific drug for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.24,25 A U.S study showed that remdesivir had good therapeutic effect.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] Now China has carried out preliminary clinical trials on this drug.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] Currently, the clinical treatment mainly includes empirical antibacterial drugs, intravenous injection of ribavirin for antiviral, and appropriate dose of methylprednisolone to alleviate the shortness of breath. At the same time, it is suggested to use traditional Chinese medicine properly to improve the physical signs of patients. In this study, as there was no critical case, no patient used invasive ventilator. All three hospitals were followed the above scheme. At present, 21 cases have been discharged from the hospital with an average length of stay for 8 days, no death was reported, and all other patients were still in hospital.",
            "This study is limited by its retrospective nature. First of all, due to the limited number of patients, our conclusions need to be further verified by large samples and multi-center data. Secondly, the prognosis is unavailable at the time of analysis, and extended follow-up time would provide more detailed information about potential risk factors that interfere with clinical outcomes. Third, only two cities in Jiangsu Province are selected in this study.",
            "Although they are representative, more urban cases need to be included to make the research results more accurate.",
            "To sum up, in-depth study is still needed for patients with COVID-19. Reliable rapid pathogen detection and practical differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians to contact suspected patients for the first time, and it is urgent to develop virus vaccines and effective drugs.",
