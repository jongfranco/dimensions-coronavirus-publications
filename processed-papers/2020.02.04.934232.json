        "abstract": "BackgroundNew endemic disease has been spread across Wuhan City, China on December 2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a \u201cpublic-health emergency of international concern\u201d due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach.MethodSeveral techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.ResultsExtensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.ConclusionT cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety, immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.",

In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a global pandemic with cases in more than 45 countries where the COVID-19 spreading fast outside China, most significantly in South Korea, Italy and Iran with over 2,924 deaths and 85,212 cases confirmed while 39,537 recovered at 29 February 2020, 06:05 AM (GMT). COVID-19 is a positive-sense single stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA). Its RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. It belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus, Genus Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae.

            "Designing of a novel vaccine is very crucial to defending the rapid endless of global burden of disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. In the last few decades, biotechnology has advanced rapidly; alongside with the understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards rational vaccines design [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. Peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen specific for B and T cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>].Applying the advanced bioinformatics tools and databases, various peptide-based vaccines could be designed where the peptides act as ligands [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>]. This approach has been used frequently in Saint Louis encephalitis virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>], dengue virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>], chikungunya virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>] proposing promising peptides for designing vaccines. The COVID-19 is an RNA virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the DNA viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c68\" href=\"#r68\">68</a>]. These mutations lied on the surface of the protein, which make COVID-19 more superior than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in blind spot [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>]. In our present work, different peptides were proposed for the designing of vaccine against COVID-19 (Fig. 1). In the beginning, the whole genome of COVID-19 was analyzed by comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>]. Artemis Comparative Tool (ACT) was used to analyze human Coronavirus (HCov-HKU1) reference sequence vs. Wuhan-Hu-1 COVID-19. Results obtained (Fig.2) revealed extensive mutation among the tested genomes. New genes; ORF8 and ORF6; were found inserted in COVID-19 which were absent in HCov-HKU1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>]. High rate of mutation between the two genomes were observed in the region from 20000 bp to the end of the sequence. This region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus which are envelope (E) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and spike (S) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>]. These conserved antigenic sites were revealed in previous studies through sequence alignment between MERS-CoV and Bat-coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>] and analyzed in SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>]. The four proteins were then analyzed by Vaxigen software to test the probability of antigenic proteins. Protein E was found to be the most antigenic gene with the highest probability as shown in Table 1. Literature survey confirmed this result in which protein E was investigated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. Furthermore, the conservation of this protein against the seven strains was tested and confirmed through the use of BioEdit package tool (Fig. 3). As phylogenetic analysis is very powerful tool for determining the evolutionary relationship between strains. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed using ClustalW for the seven strains of coronavirus, which are COVID-19(NC_04551), SARS-CoV (FJ211859), MESA-CoV (NC_019843), HCoV-HKU1 (AY884001), HCoV-OC43 (KF923903), HCoVNL63 (NC_005831) and HCoV-229E (KY983587). The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree revealed that COVID-19 is found in the same clade of SARS-CoV, thus the two strains are highly related to each other (Fig. 4). The immune response of T cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to B cell, where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c76\" href=\"#r76\">76</a>]. Vaccines that effectively generate cell-mediated response are needed to provide protection against the invading pathogen. Moreover the CD8+ T and CD4+ T cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>]. Thus designing vaccine against T cell is much more important. Choosing protein E as the antigenic site, the binding affinity to MHC molecules was then evaluated. The protein reference sequence was submitted to IEDB MHC predication tool. 21 peptides were found to bind MHC class I with different affinities (Table 1), from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage (Table 2; Fig. 5).Analysis in IEDB MHC II binding prediction tool resulted in prediction of 61 peptides (Table 2), from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage (Table 3; Fig.5). Unfortunately, IEDB did not give any result for B cell epitopes, this might be due to the length of the COVID19 (75 amino acids). It is well known that peptides recognized with high number of HLA molecules are potentially inducing immune response. Based on the aforementioned results and taking into consideration the high binding affinity to both MHC classes I and II, conservancy and population coverage, three peptides are strongly proposed to formulate a new vaccine against COVID-19. These findings were further confirmed by the results obtained for the molecular docking of the proposed peptides and HLA-A*02:01. The formed complex between MHC molecule and the three peptides (YVYSRVKNL, SLVKPSFYV and LAILTALRL) have shown peptide amino- and carboxyl-termini forming one and three hydrogen bonds, respectively at the two ends of a binding groove with MHC residues with least binding energy -13.2 kcal/mol, -11 kcal/mol and -11.3 kcal/mol, respectively (Fig.6C, D and E). Although both flu and anti-HIV drugs are used currently in China for treatment of COVID-19, and chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, has recently found to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c79\" href=\"#r79\">79</a>]; nevertheless more studies are required to standardize these therapies. In addition, there has been some success in the development of mouse models of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, and candidate vaccines where the envelope (E) protein is mutated or deleted have been described [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>]. To best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify certain peptides in envelope (E) protein as candidates for COVID-19. Accordingly, these epitopes were strongly recommended as promising epitopes vaccine candidate against T cell."

The sequence of COVID-19 RBD, together with its RBM that contacts receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was found similar to that of SARS coronavirus. On January 2020, a group of scientists demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].",
            "However, COVID-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at 2019-nCoV receptor-binding motif (particularly Gln493) which provide advantageous interactions with human ACE2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. This difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel coronavirus is more contagious than those other viruses. At present, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for humans, but Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be possible treatments for COVID-19. However, there are no clinical trials approving the safety and efficacy for these drugs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. The main concept within all the immunizations is the ability of the vaccine to initiate an immune response in a faster mode than the pathogen itself. Although traditional vaccines, which depend on biochemical trials, induced potent neutralizing and protective responses in the immunized animals but they can be costly, allergenic, time consuming and require in vitro culture of pathogenic viruses leading to serious concern of safety [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Thus the need for safe and efficacious vaccines is highly recommended. Peptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe, and their selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. The core mechanism of the peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized B-cell and T-cell epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. B-cell epitope of a target molecule can be linked with a T-cell epitope to make it immunogenic. The T-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments (8-20 amino acids), whereas the B-cell epitopes can be proteins [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to design a peptide-based vaccine to predict epitopes from corona envelope (E) protein using immunoinformatics analysis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. While rapid further studies are recommended to prove the efficiency of the predicted epitopes as a peptide vaccine against this emerging infection."

            "Designing of a novel vaccine is very crucial to defending the rapid endless of global burden of disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. In the last few decades, biotechnology has advanced rapidly; alongside with the understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards rational vaccines design [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. Peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen specific for B and T cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>].Applying the advanced bioinformatics tools and databases, various peptide-based vaccines could be designed where the peptides act as ligands [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>]. This approach has been used frequently in Saint Louis encephalitis virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>], dengue virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>], chikungunya virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>] proposing promising peptides for designing vaccines. The COVID-19 is an RNA virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the DNA viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c68\" href=\"#r68\">68</a>]. These mutations lied on the surface of the protein, which make COVID-19 more superior than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in blind spot [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c69\" href=\"#r69\">69</a>]. In our present work, different peptides were proposed for the designing of vaccine against COVID-19 (Fig. 1). In the beginning, the whole genome of COVID-19 was analyzed by comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>]. Artemis Comparative Tool (ACT) was used to analyze human Coronavirus (HCov-HKU1) reference sequence vs. Wuhan-Hu-1 COVID-19. Results obtained (Fig.2) revealed extensive mutation among the tested genomes. New genes; ORF8 and ORF6; were found inserted in COVID-19 which were absent in HCov-HKU1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c71\" href=\"#r71\">71</a>]. High rate of mutation between the two genomes were observed in the region from 20000 bp to the end of the sequence. This region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus which are envelope (E) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and spike (S) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c73\" href=\"#r73\">73</a>]. These conserved antigenic sites were revealed in previous studies through sequence alignment between MERS-CoV and Bat-coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c74\" href=\"#r74\">74</a>] and analyzed in SARS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c75\" href=\"#r75\">75</a>]. The four proteins were then analyzed by Vaxigen software to test the probability of antigenic proteins. Protein E was found to be the most antigenic gene with the highest probability as shown in Table 1. Literature survey confirmed this result in which protein E was investigated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. Furthermore, the conservation of this protein against the seven strains was tested and confirmed through the use of BioEdit package tool (Fig. 3). As phylogenetic analysis is very powerful tool for determining the evolutionary relationship between strains. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed using ClustalW for the seven strains of coronavirus, which are COVID-19(NC_04551), SARS-CoV (FJ211859), MESA-CoV (NC_019843), HCoV-HKU1 (AY884001), HCoV-OC43 (KF923903), HCoVNL63 (NC_005831) and HCoV-229E (KY983587). The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree revealed that COVID-19 is found in the same clade of SARS-CoV, thus the two strains are highly related to each other (Fig. 4). The immune response of T cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to B cell, where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c76\" href=\"#r76\">76</a>]. Vaccines that effectively generate cell-mediated response are needed to provide protection against the invading pathogen. Moreover the CD8+ T and CD4+ T cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c77\" href=\"#r77\">77</a>]. Thus designing vaccine against T cell is much more important. Choosing protein E as the antigenic site, the binding affinity to MHC molecules was then evaluated. The protein reference sequence was submitted to IEDB MHC predication tool. 21 peptides were found to bind MHC class I with different affinities (Table 1), from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage (Table 2; Fig. 5).Analysis in IEDB MHC II binding prediction tool resulted in prediction of 61 peptides (Table 2), from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage (Table 3; Fig.5). Unfortunately, IEDB did not give any result for B cell epitopes, this might be due to the length of the COVID19 (75 amino acids). It is well known that peptides recognized with high number of HLA molecules are potentially inducing immune response. Based on the aforementioned results and taking into consideration the high binding affinity to both MHC classes I and II, conservancy and population coverage, three peptides are strongly proposed to formulate a new vaccine against COVID-19. These findings were further confirmed by the results obtained for the molecular docking of the proposed peptides and HLA-A*02:01. The formed complex between MHC molecule and the three peptides (YVYSRVKNL, SLVKPSFYV and LAILTALRL) have shown peptide amino- and carboxyl-termini forming one and three hydrogen bonds, respectively at the two ends of a binding groove with MHC residues with least binding energy -13.2 kcal/mol, -11 kcal/mol and -11.3 kcal/mol, respectively (Fig.6C, D and E). Although both flu and anti-HIV drugs are used currently in China for treatment of COVID-19, and chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, has recently found to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c78\" href=\"#r78\">78</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c79\" href=\"#r79\">79</a>]; nevertheless more studies are required to standardize these therapies. In addition, there has been some success in the development of mouse models of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, and candidate vaccines where the envelope (E) protein is mutated or deleted have been described [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c80\" href=\"#r80\">80</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>]. To best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify certain peptides in envelope (E) protein as candidates for COVID-19. Accordingly, these epitopes were strongly recommended as promising epitopes vaccine candidate against T cell."
        ],
        "5. Conclusion": [
            "Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered in COVID-19 strain using the comparative sequencing. In addition, a number of MHC class I and II related peptides were found promising candidates. Among which the peptides YVYSRVKNL, SLVKPSFYV and LAILTALRL show high potentiality for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage. T cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically ensuring its safety and immunogenic profile to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks."
