        "abstract": "Viruses are the main cause of respiratory tract infections. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables unbiased detection of all potential pathogens. To apply mNGS in viral diagnostics, sensitive and simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses is needed. Herein, were studied the performance of an in-house mNGS protocol for routine diagnostics of viral respiratory infections with potential for automated pan-pathogen detection. The sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis were designed and optimized, including exogenous internal controls. Subsequently, the protocol was retrospectively validated using 25 clinical respiratory samples. The developed protocol using Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing showed high repeatability. Use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information\u2019s RefSeq database as opposed to the National Center for Biotechnology Information\u2019s nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of classification of viral pathogens. A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value. Sensitivity of mNGS, compared with PCR, varied up to 83%, with specificity of 94%, dependent on the cutoff for defining positive mNGS results. Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS, not present in the routine diagnostic workflow, were influenza C, KI polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and enterovirus. Sensitivity and analytical specificity of this mNGS protocol were comparable to PCR and higher when considering off-PCR target viral pathogens. One single test detected all potential viral pathogens and simultaneously obtained detailed information on detected viruses.

            "application would require the careful definition and validation of several parameters to enable the accurate assessment of a clinical sample with regard to the presence or absence of a pathogen, to fulfill current accreditation guidelines. Therefore, this study has initiated the optimization of several steps throughout the presequencing and postsequencing workflow, which are considered essential for sensitive and specific mNGS-based virus detection. Many virus discovery or virus diagnostic protocols have focused on the enrichment of viral particles[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] with the intention to increase the relative amount of virus reads. However, these methods are laborious and intrinsically exclude viral nucleic acid located in host cells. Herein, a sample pretreatment protocol was designed with potential for: i) automation, ii) pan-pathogen detection, and iii) detection of intracellular viral nucleic acids. Consequently, any type of viral enrichment was excluded (filtration, centrifugation, nucleases, and rRNA removal). The current protocol enabled highthroughput sample pretreatment by means of automated nucleic acid extraction and without depletion of bacterial or human genome, with potential for pan-pathogen detection. Several adaptations in the bioinformatic script resulted in more accurate reporting of the classification output.",
            "Addition of an internal control to a PCR is commonly used for quality control in qPCR.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] Although the addition of internal controls in mNGS is not yet an accepted standard procedure, EAV and PhHV1 were used as an RNA and a DNA control, respectively, to monitor the workflow in this diagnostic application. The amount of internal control reads and target virus reads has been reported to be dependent on the amount of background reads (negative correlation).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] In our protocol, the internal controls were used as qualitative controls but may be used as indicator of the amount of background. PhHV1 showed less linearity in the dilution series, compared with EAV, which may be indicative for a potential relative difference in efficiency of amplification of PhHV1 viral sequences. Because NCBI\u2019s databases were lacking a complete PhHV1 genome, the Centrifuge index",

To achieve classification of PhHV1 at the species level, the whole genome of PhHV1 was sequenced; and based on the gained sequence reads, the genome was built.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] The proposed nearly complete genome of PhHV1 was submitted to NCBI\u2019s GenBank database.",
            "Sensitivity of the mNGS protocol was maximum 83% based on PCR target viruses and depended on the cutoff level of reads for defining a positive result. Five viruses, which were not recovered by mNGS, had high Cq values, >30 (ie, a relatively low viral load). This may be a drawback of the retrospective nature of this clinical evaluation as RNA viruses may be degraded because of storage and freeze-thaw steps, resulting in lower sensitivity of mNGS. A correlation was found between read counts and PCR Cq value, demonstrating the quantitative nature of viral detection by mNGS. Discrepancies between the Cq values and the number of mNGS reads may be explained by unrepresentative Cq values (eg, by primer mismatch for highly divergent viruses, like rhinoviruses/enteroviruses and differences in sensitivity of mNGS for several groups of",
            "viruses, as has been reported by others).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] In addition, viral pathogens were detected that were not targeted by the routine PCR assays, including influenza C virus, which is typical of the unbiased nature of the method. In addition, although not within the scope of this study, bacterial pathogens, including Bordetella pertussis (qPCR confirmed), were also detected. In the current study, only viruses were targeted because these could be well compared with qPCR results; bacterial targets remain to be studied in clinical sample types as sputum or bronchoalveolar lavages that are more suitable for bacterial detection. The analytical specificity of mNGS appeared to be high, especially with a cutoff of 15 reads. However, the clinical specificity, the relevance of the lower read numbers, still needs further investigation in clinical studies.",
            "Sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 4000 with single, unique indexes resulted in rhinovirus-C sequences (55 to 909 reads) in all samples run on one lane, which appeared to be identical sequences. Retesting of the samples with Illumina NextSeq 500 resulted in disappearance of these reads. This problem could be attributed to index hopping (index misassignment), as described earlier.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] Because of the chemistry, essential for the increased speed, the HiSeq 4000 is more prone to index hopping between neighboring samples. Although the percentage of reads that contributed to the index hopping was low, this is critical for clinical viral diagnostics, as this is aimed specifically at low abundance targets.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]",
            "Bioinformatics classification of metagenomic sequence data with the pipeline Centrifuge required identification of the optimal parameters to minimize misclassified and unclassified reads. Default settings of this pipeline resulted in higher rates of both false-positive and false-negative results. NCBI\u2019s nucleotide database includes a wide variety of unannotated viral sequences, such as partial sequences and (chimeric) constructs, in contrast to the curated and wellannotated sequences in NCBI\u2019s RefSeq database, which resulted in a higher specificity. In addition to the database, settings for the assignment algorithm were adapted as well. The assignment settings were adjusted to unique assignment in the case of homology to the lowest common ancestor. This modification resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity than the default settings; however, the ability to further subtyping diminished. This is likely to be attributed to the limited representation/availability of strain types within NCBI\u2019s RefSeq database. In consequence, this leads to a more accurate estimation of the common ancestor for particular viruses, but limited typing results in case of highly variable ones. To obtain optimal typing results, additional annotated sequences may be added or a new database should be built, with a high variety of well-defined and frequently updated virus strain types.",
            "To conclude, this study contributes to the increasing evidence that metagenomic NGS can effectively be used for a wide variety of diagnostic assays in virology, such as unbiased virus detection, resistance mutations, virulence markers, and epidemiology, as shown by the ability to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms in influenza virus.",
            "These findings support the feasibility of moving this promising field forward to a role in the routine detection of pathogens by the use of mNGS. Further optimization should include the parallel evaluation of adult samples, the inclusion of additional annotated strain sequences to the database, and further elaboration of the classification algorithm and reporting for clinical diagnostics. The importance of both negative nontemplate control samples[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] and healthy control cases may support the critical discrimination of contaminants and viral colonization from clinically relevant pathogens."

Interpretation of clinical relevance is an important issue but essentially not different from the use of PCR-based assays and supported by the available information on typing and relative quantities.
