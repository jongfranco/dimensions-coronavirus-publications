        "abstract": "The silkworm (Bombyx mori) and its pupae have been used for decades as nutritional additives and applied on the production of high-quality recombinant proteins via the baculovirus expression vector (BEV) system. The bio-capsule, the fat-rich body, and some body components of the silkworm pupae, which deliver antigens passing through the harsh environment of digestive tract and reaching the intestine, have been used as a vehicle for oral vaccines. In the present study, to develop a novel oral vaccine against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the PEDV spike (S) protein was expressed in silkworm pupae and BmN cells using the BEV system. After three doses of oral administra\u2010 tions with 2-week intervals in pigs, neither PEDV S protein-specific humoral nor mucosal immune responses can be detected. The failure of eliciting the PEDV-specific immune response suggested that the BEV system using BmN cells or silkworm pupae as oral immunogen-expression vehicles was not able to overcome the immunological unrespon\u2010 siveness, which was possibly due to gastrointestinal specific barriers and oral tolerance. Better strategies to enhance the delivery and immunogenicity of oral vaccines should be further investigated. Nevertheless, the PEDV S protein generated in the BmN cells and silkworm pupae herein provides an efficient tool to produce the recombinant antigen for future applications.",

            "The silkworm (Bombyx mori) and its pupae have been used for decades as nutritional additives and applied on the production of high-quality recombinant proteins via the baculovirus expression vector (BEV) system. The bio-capsule, the fat-rich body, and some body components of the silkworm pupae, which deliver antigens passing through the harsh environment of digestive tract and reaching the intestine, have been used as a vehicle for oral vaccines. In the present study, to develop a novel oral vaccine against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the PEDV spike (S) protein was expressed in silkworm pupae and BmN cells using the BEV system. After three doses of oral administra\u2010 tions with 2-week intervals in pigs, neither PEDV S protein-specific humoral nor mucosal immune responses can be detected. The failure of eliciting the PEDV-specific immune response suggested that the BEV system using BmN cells or silkworm pupae as oral immunogen-expression vehicles was not able to overcome the immunological unrespon\u2010 siveness, which was possibly due to gastrointestinal specific barriers and oral tolerance. Better strategies to enhance the delivery and immunogenicity of oral vaccines should be further investigated. Nevertheless, the PEDV S protein generated in the BmN cells and silkworm pupae herein provides an efficient tool to produce the recombinant antigen for future applications.",

Briefly, the purified S protein of PEDV expressed by HEK 293 cells were diluted and coated on the Nunc maxi-soap plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in the concentration of 2 ng/\u03bcL. After a 16-h incubation under 4 \u00b0C, the plates were washed six times with washing buffer (KPL, SeraCare, Milford, MA, USA) in the volume of 200 \u03bcL, then followed by an hour of blocking procedure by incubating the plates with blocking buffer (KPL, SeraCare) under room temperature. For detecting systemic PEDV specific IgG, plasma of piglets as well as a positive serum control and a negative serum control were 40-fold diluted in the blocking buffer (KPL, SeraCare) and applied onto the plates for an hour incubation. To detect the oral mucosal IgA level of piglets, the re-suspended supernatant of the oral swabs was twofold diluted in the blocking buffer (KPL, SeraCare) and applied onto the PEDV S coated plates for 16-h incubation under 4 \u00b0C. Then, the plates were washed three times with washing buffer and incubated with 1000-fold diluted secondary antibodies, the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (KPL, SeraCare) or a HRP-conjugated goat anti-pig IgA antibody (KPL, SeraCare) in the dilution of 5000-fold for another 1 h. After the plates were completely washed six times with wash buffer (KPL, SeraCare), the \u00adABTS\u00ae Peroxidase Substrates (KPL, SeraCare) was added onto the plates in the volume of 50 \u03bcL and incubated for 3 min under room temperature. To stop the coloration reaction, 50 \u03bcL stopping solution (KPL, SeraCare) was added. The plates were read by the EMax Plus Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Crawley, UK) under the wavelength of 405 nm to obtain the optical density (OD) values of each well.

The double positive clones for the EGFP and RFP were picked and propagated in the BmN cells. The titers of each S-Bm viral clone were determined and the S-Bm clone which had a highest viral titer of \u00ad108 \u00adTCID50/mL was selected. The expression of PEDV S protein in S-Bm infected BmN cells was detected by the IFA using anti-PEDV S-specific antibodies as well as western blotting using the anti-6\u00d7 His tag antibody. In the Fig. 3, the recombinant S protein expressed on the S-Bm cells was successfully detected in more than 95% cells by using the anti-PEDV S monoclonal antibody, P4B-1. The fluorescence of EGFP was also observed on the S-Bm cells which indicated the successful transduction of S-Bm in BmN cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the size of the target protein migrated between 130 and 250 kilo dalton (kDa), corresponding to the predicted size of PEDV S protein (approximately 170\u2013200 kDa).

        "Discussion": [
            "Oral vaccination provides the possibility of stimulating both systemic and mucosal immune responses (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChattha_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rChattha_et+al_2015_a\">Chattha et al 2015</a>), which might be a solution for development of an effective PEDV vaccine in pigs. In the present study, the S-Bm baculovirus has been successfully constructed, the full-length S protein of PEDV was also produced in both BmN cells and in the silkworm pupae. Although some cleaved S proteins were detected, both BmN cells and silkworm pupae expression systems were efficient to produce the full-length PEDV S protein. Taking advantages of the high productivity and the natural ability for the baculovirus to stimulate the immune responses, the S-expressing BmN cells and the pupae were subsequently",
            "Nevertheless, the high yield productivity of PEDV S protein in the S-Bm infected BmN cells and silkworm pupae provides an efficient tool to produce the recombinant antigen protein for future developments of PEDV vaccines and diagnostic tools.",
            "Previously, several studies have achieved certain level of immunogenicity and protection against bacteria or viruses in mice, grass carp, or crayfish by directly oral administration of the recombinant proteins derived from silkworms (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWei_2009_a\" href=\"#rWei_2009_a\">Wei and Xu 2009</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cXu_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rXu_et+al_2006_a\">Xu et al 2006</a>; Xue et al 2013; Zhang et al 2011). However, in contrast to these findings, oral administration of PEDV S protein expressing BmN cells or silkworm pupae was not able to elicit PEDV S specific immunogenicity in pigs in the present study. In fish and invertebrates, as compared with mammals, the less acidity of stomach and fore guts, and different enzymatic capabilities might allow more recombinant antigens with intact structural integrity passing through guts for stimulating oral immunity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBrown_2015_a\" href=\"#rBrown_2015_a\">Brown 2015</a>). In the mice study, in addition to the UreB and HspA antigens of Helicobacter pylori were expressed in silkworm, a mucosal adjuvant, cholera toxin B subunit, was used to enhance oral immunity (Zhang et al 2011). The high acidity and enzymatic capability in porcine stomach and intestine, and no adjuvant was added to overcome the oral tolerance might contribute to the failure of eliciting immunogenicity in pigs in our study.",
            "To increase the efficacy of an oral vaccine, several improvements and key points could be addressed. First, the usage of mucosal-specific adjuvants is the most common strategy to enhance the mucosal immunity. For example, the cholera toxin subunits, cytokines, mucosal chemokines, and toll-like receptor ligands, chitosan... etc., are all popular choices for mucosal adjuvants (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cRhee_et+al_2012_a\" href=\"#rRhee_et+al_2012_a\">Rhee et al 2012</a>). These adjuvants were able to target the intestinal M-cells and enhance adhesion of the antigen or antigen carrying vectors to the mucosal epithelium or antigen presenting cells for facilitating the immunogenicity of the oral vaccine (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSilin_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rSilin_et+al_2007_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSilin_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rSilin_et+al_2007_a\">Silin et al 2007</a></a>). In addition, encapsulating the antigen with PH-resistant and/or enzyme-resistant materials, such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLG), polysterene, polyethylene glycol (PEG), liposomes and cochleates...etc., may help to improve the integrity of the antigen and prevent its degradation in the gastrointestinal tract (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSilin_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rSilin_et+al_2007_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSilin_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rSilin_et+al_2007_a\">Silin et al 2007</a></a>). The sizes of the capsule and the viscosity of the formula are also critical in developing the oral vaccines. For instance, an optimal size of approximately 10 \u03bcm particles would help to prolong contact of the antigen with villus mucosal membrane (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMoser_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rMoser_et+al_2003_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMoser_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rMoser_et+al_2003_a\">Moser et al 2003</a></a>); a smaller size (approximately 0.2\u20130.5 \u03bcm) showed a better choice to be uptaken by the phagocytes and further antigen presentation (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMoser_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rMoser_et+al_2003_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMoser_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rMoser_et+al_2003_a\">Moser et al 2003</a></a>). Some viral vectors, like the baculovirus, share the common receptors and broad tissue tropism thus are able to stimulate the immune responses in many hosts (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cThiem_2009_a\" href=\"#rThiem_2009_a\">Thiem and Cheng 2009</a>).",
            "In the present study, the yield of the intact recombinant S protein was estimated at least 17 \u03bcg per pupa and 6 \u03bcg in 1 \u00d7 106 S-Bm infected BmN cells. However, large amounts of smaller protein, which was suspected as the cleaved S proteins, migrated to the molecular weight of 55\u201360 kDa was also detected. This observation indicates that the productivity of the S protein in BmN cells as well as the silkworm pupae was underestimated. The spontaneously cleavage or degradation of the recombinant proteins is often observed in the baculovirus protein expression system, especially using the bio-factory protein production methods such as the silkworm expression system (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKato_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rKato_et+al_2010_a\">Kato et al 2010</a>). The possible reason is due to the spontaneous activation of baculovirus cysteine protease, v-cath, during the procedure of the protein production (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKadono-Okuda_et+al_1995_a\" href=\"#rKadono-Okuda_et+al_1995_a\">Kadono-Okuda et al 1995</a>). To keep the integrity of the recombinant protein, a cysteine proteasedeleted BmNPV might be used in the future for protein production by using the biofactory protein expression system of baculovirus.",
            "In the present study, the absence of additive, mucosalspecific adjuvanted strategy might be responsible for the failure of inducing the immune reactions by oral administration of PEDV S-expressing pupae in piglets. Even though successfully eliciting the immunity by oral administrations with crude materials of antigen-expressing insect cells has been demonstrated in several studies (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWei_2009_a\" href=\"#rWei_2009_a\">Wei and Xu 2009</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cXu_et+al_2006_a\" href=\"#rXu_et+al_2006_a\">Xu et al 2006</a>; Xue et al 2013; Zhang et al 2011), the differences of the microenvironment in the digestive tract and the discrepant activation mechanisms of immune system of different host species might contribute to the differences. Considering the immune tolerance and microenvironment of the digestive tract in pigs, the modification of formula and the usage of adjuvants to improve the stimulation of desirable and protective immune responses would be an important task for developing oral vaccines in pigs.",
