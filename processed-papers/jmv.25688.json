        "abstract": "There is a worldwide concern about the new coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV as a global public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV, 12 whole genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV, and 12 highly similar whole genome sequences available in gene bank (five from the severe acute respiratory syndrome, two from Middle East respiratory syndrome, and five from bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus). Fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation analysis shows that the nucleocapsid and the spike glycoprotein have some sites under positive pressure, whereas homology modeling revealed some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019\u2010nCoV significantly clustered with bat SARS\u2010 like coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in Spike Glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. From these results, the new 2019\u2010nCoV is distinct from SARS virus, probably trasmitted from bats after mutation conferring ability to infect humans.",

The 2019\u2010nCoV is significantly and closely related only to the specific bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus isolated from Rhinolophus sinicus in 2015 in China (MG772934.1) (Figure 1).<br/><br/>Regarding the FUBAR analysis performed on the N Region, significant (P < .05) pervasive episodic selection was found in two sites (380th and 410th nucleotide position using the reference sequence; Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate labeled Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101 MN908947.3). On the 380th aminoacidic position in the Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a glutamine residue instead of an asparagine residue, whereas on the 410th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine residue.

            "The data reported above show that the new 2019\u2010nCoV significantly clustered with a sequence from the bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus isolated in 2015. Moreover, in the phylogenetic tree, these two sequences are separated from the other bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus sequences, suggesting that this bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus is homologous and genetically more similar to the 2019\u2010nCoV than to the other sequences of Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus. This supports the hypothesis that the transmission chain began from the bat and reached the human. All other genomic sequences represented in the phylogenetic tree, also including SARS and MERS coronavirus, clustered separately, thus excluding the fact that the virus involved in the actual epidemic could belong to these subgenuses. The structural analysis of two important viral proteins, the nucleocapsid and the spike\u2010like nucleoprotein (protein S), confirmed the significant similarity of the new coronavirus with the bat\u2010like SARS coronavirus and its difference from SARS coronavirus.<br/><br/>From the selective pressure and structural analysis, mutations of surface proteins, as the spike protein S, and of nucleocapsid N protein conferring stability to the viral particle have been shown. The viral spike protein is responsible for virus entry into the cell after by binding to a cell receptor and membrane fusion, two key steps in viral infection and pathogenesis. The N protein is a structural protein involved in virion assembly, playing a pivotal role in virus transcription and assembly efficiency. Mutation of these proteins could determine two important characteristics of the coronavirus isolated during the 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic: a higher ability to infect and enhanced pathogenicity than the bat\u2010like SARS coronavirus but lower pathogenicity than SARS coronavirus. These features can explain the 2019\u2010nCoV zoonotic transmission and its initial lower severity than SARS epidemic. These results do not exclude the fact that further mutation due to positive selective pressure, led by the epidemic evolution, could favor an enhancement of pathogenicity and transmission of this novel virus."

This clade includes two different clusters: cluster IIa with Bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus and the 2019\u2010nCoV sequences, and cluster IIb with the bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus and the SARS virus sequences. The 2019\u2010nCoV is significantly and closely related only to the specific bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus isolated from Rhinolophus sinicus in 2015 in China (MG772934.1) (Figure 1).",
            "Regarding the FUBAR analysis performed on the N Region, significant (P < .05) pervasive episodic selection was found in two sites (380th and 410th nucleotide position using the reference sequence; Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate labeled Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101 MN908947.3). On the 380th aminoacidic position in the Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a glutamine residue instead of an asparagine residue, whereas on the 410th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine residue. A significant (P < .05) pervasive negative selection in six sites (14%) has been evidenced and confirmed by FUBAR analysis. Concerning the sequences in clade II, on the 409th aminoacidic position in the Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is glutamine instead of an asparagine residue, whereas, on the 380th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine. A significant (P < .05) pervasive negative selection in six sites (14%) has been evidenced and confirmed by FUBAR analysis.",
            "On the S region, a significant (P < .05) pervasive episodic selection was found in two different sites (536th and 644th nucleotide position using the reference sequence; the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate labeled Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101 MN908947.3). For the sequences in clade II, on the 536th aminoacidic position in the Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is an asparagine residue instead of an aspartic acid residue, whereas, on the 644th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine residue. A significant (P < .05) pervasive negative selection in 1065 sites (87%) has been evidenced and confirmed by FUBAR analysis, suggesting that the S region could be highly conserved.",
            "No sites under positive selection sites have been found in the E and M regions.",
            "The N region of the 2019\u2010nCoV homology model has been built using a SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein structure (2jw8.1) as the statistical test has shown that this is the most stable and similar model among the other possible structures (Ramachandran favored 90.52%, GMQE 0.17, QMEAN \u22122.43), whereas, for the S region, the 2019\u2010nCoV homology model has been built using a SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein (6acc.1) for the same reason (Ramachandran favored 87.87%, GMQE 0.83, QMEAN \u22123.14) (Figure 3).",
            "The further structural and molecular analysis of the Nucleocapsid region of the 2019\u2010nCoV (MN908947.3) has highlighted that 2019\u2010nCoV and the bat SARS\u2010like coronavirus (MG772934.) share the same aminoacidic sequence near the 309th position (SKQLQQ,) whereas the SARS reference genome has a different aminoacidic sequence (SRQLQN).

The SARS virus, instead, has an aspartic acid residue. On the 644th aminoacidic position in 2019\u2010nCoV sequence, there is a threonine residue, whereas the bat SARS\u2010like virus has a serine residue.
