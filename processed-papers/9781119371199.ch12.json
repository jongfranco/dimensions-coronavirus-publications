TCV is shed in feces of infected birds and spreads horizontally through ingestion of feces and feces\u2010contaminated materials. Turkey coronavirus has been identified in most turkey producing regions of the world.",

            "capsid gene is staggering (8, 11, 23, 24) (Figure 12.10B) and there is increasing evidence that AstVs can undergo recombination (8, 21, 37). Genetic analysis suggests that TAstV\u20101 and TAstV\u20102 should be reconsidered as subtypes instead of serotypes and that multiple serotypes of TAstV\u20102 exist (24, 37). Based on the ORF2 sequence, the recently emerged CAstV can also be separated into two groups, namely A and B, which support the previous evidence of two serogroups with low degree of cross\u2010reactivity. Chicken astrovirus groups A and B share low level of amino acid identity, estimated at 38\u201340% in ORF2 (33)."

The realization that pathogens other than bacteria must be an important component of the etiology of enteric disease has fueled the search for other infectious agents with specific emphasis on viruses. The availability of diagnostic tools was another incentive. Most useful among these tools was direct and immune electron microscopy and increasing the use of next generation sequencing.",
            "The morphologic identification of viruses by electron microscopy from gut contents paved the way for attempts to purify, cultivate, and develop diagnostic reagents and to further characterize these agents. Another technique that was used successfully earlier to identify some viruses in fecal samples is electropherotyping of genomic RNA. This technique is useful for detection and differentiation of double\u2010stranded RNA viruses, such as rotaviruses and reoviruses.",
            "A significant finding reported in the earlier studies was the presence of a variety of viral species that could be present in different combinations in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of young poultry. The availability of specific pathogen free (SPF) poultry was of major value in studies of these viruses. In the last decade, more diagnostic technologies such as reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) became available and are used routinely in some laboratories to detect enteric viruses in gut contents. Removal of inhibitors from fecal material has increased the utility of the test. In addition, the use of internal controls has improved the test specificity.",
            "Most enteric viral infections occur in the first three weeks of life. The clinical signs and lesions induced by the different viruses have similarities; hence, it is difficult to attribute a specific enteric disease to a given virus unless laboratory studies are initiated to identify the causative agent(s). In addition, the presence of different combinations of viruses could result in varied disease presentations. In general, high morbidity and low mortality exist when only one virus is detected, but mortality could be high when several viruses are present. An example of the significant economic impact of these combinations is the condition that was designated poult enteritis and mortality syndrome that was identified in the United States.",
            "Different terms have been used in the literature to describe different conditions/syndromes of enteric disease. Unfortunately such descriptions are not instructive and are confusing at best because these descriptions do not refer to a specific etiology or etiologies. Because diagnostic tools are available for most enteric viral infections, it is preferable to designate these conditions as enteritis with reference, when available, to the specific infectious agents involved.",
            "Diarrhea is a common manifestation of the disease, and the GI tract is usually distended with gas and liquid/ frothy contents. Different viruses replicate at different parts of the GI tract and at different sites on the villi. Epidemiologic studies indicated that most of these viruses do not persist for long in the birds. Unfortunately, many of the enteric viruses are uncultivable, which hampers research and diagnostics.",
            "Little evidence of egg transmission of enteric viruses exists, and there are gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology of the infections. Active immunity apparently plays a role in limiting the disease, but the benefits of passive immunity are limited to the first few days of life. No commercial vaccines are available for most of these infections.",
            "Enteric viruses are commonly the cause of most of the primary insults to the GI tract of young poultry. This provides other agents, especially bacteria, with the milieu to replicate, attach, and penetrate cells, leading to further damage. It has been shown that during the course of",

Counteracting secondary bacterial involvement is probably the reason for the reported effectiveness of antibiotic treatment of some cases of enteric disease initiated by viruses in young birds.",
            "The GI tract has the largest surface area in the body, and it is continually exposed to a variety of insults and stimulations. In food animals, the integrity of the GI tract is of paramount importance. Efficient utilization of nutrients depends on a healthy GI tract, and this is especially true for the young of the species. Damage to the GI tract early in life could result in irreversible damage to the flock.",
            "The progress made in the last three decades has been remarkable, but gaps remain in our knowledge of enteric viruses and new enteric viruses continue to be detected as evidenced by the recognition of parvoviruses in chickens and turkeys in this chapter. Further information that could lead to novel methods for control of these infections should be significant.",

However, only 10% of AstVs in a population may exhibit this morphology, and visualization depends on sample preparation leading to cautions about the use of TEM for diagnosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Astroviruses are nonenveloped and composed of a positive\u2010sense RNA genome 6.5\u20137.5 kilobase (kb) in length containing three open reading frames (ORF). These reading frames code for nonstructural proteins (ORF1a), a viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (ORF1b), and a capsid protein (ORF2). Their replication strategy is quite distinct from other enteric virus families in that they synthesize a subgenomic message during replication, contain a retrovirus\u2010like frame shift signal sequence between ORF1a and ORF1b, and",

For example, comparing the most conserved region of the genome, the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) from the human astrovirus type 1 (HAstV\u20101), to any of the avian viruses show s approximately 40% sequence identity. Among the different avian viruses there is great diversity ranging from only approximately 40% similarity (duck astrovirus\u20101 to other avian viruses) up to 94\u201398.9% (within TAstV\u20102 genomes).",

TAstV\u20102 infection in poults is considered a poor inducer of adaptive immune responses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. The reason for this could be the reported dysregulation of the immune response by TAstV.

This procedure is completed by pooling the feces or lower intestines from 3\u20135 birds/flock and either isolating RNA directly or passaging filtered fluids once through embryonating eggs. The RNA from the field sample or from the isolated embryo intestines then is subjected to RT\u2010PCR using oligonucleotide primers specific to two different genes of the viral genome, a conserved region and a diverse region.

However, because the majority of commercial poultry appear to become infected with avian AstVs at some point in their lifetimes, knowing that a flock is AstV positive may be of questionable importance.

This approach may be worthy of further investigation given the rather clear association between white chick disease, kidney lesions, and the infection with some strains of CAstV. The widespread occurrence of AstVs in commercial poultry coupled with their environmental stability and resistance to inactivation by most widely used disinfectants makes elimination from affected areas difficult [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>].

Based on the available information, avian encephalomyelitis virus has (Chapter 14) been classified as a species in the genus Tremovirus in the family Picornaviridae [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Similarly, nucleic acid sequence analyses of other viruses\u2014 avian nephritis virus and two viruses initially thought to be turkey ELVs\u2014have been identified as members of the family Astroviridae [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>]. Based on antigenic analyses, it is likely that several viruses initially identified as chicken ELVs will be reclassified in the future as astroviruses, because these viruses have been shown to share antigenic relationships with avian nephritis virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>].",

            "At this time there is no commercial vaccine to prevent parvovirus\u2010induced enteric diseases in poultry. Given the difficulties to propagate the viruses in vitro there are obvious challenges for vaccine development. It has been shown that maternal antibodies to chicken parvoviruses can reduce the severity of the disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>], indicating that vaccination of breeder flocks would likely result in protection of the progeny during the most susceptible early days of their lives."
