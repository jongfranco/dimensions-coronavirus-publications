With a death toll exceeding that of the SARS-CoV outbreak back in 2002 and 2003 in China, 2019-nCoV has led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. Herein, we present on an overview of the currently available information on the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this virus.",

            "In general, coronaviruses first replicate in epithelial cells of the respiratory and enteric cells, which leads to cytopathic changes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Thorough studies have not yet been conducted to elucidate the molecular basis of the pathogenicity of 2019-nCoV. However, preliminary data obtained through whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA extracted from host cell-depleted nasopharyngeal and sputum samples and subsequent bioinformatics analyses have shown that the novel virus is phylogenetically related to SARS-related coronaviruses first isolated in Chinese horseshoe bats during the period of 2015 to 2017.16,17 It has also been hypothesized that the novel virus might use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as a receptor similar to SARS-CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] Unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, primary human airway epithelial cells provide better growth conditions for 2019-nCoV than standard tissue culture cells.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]",
            "A series of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were initially reported by the Health Commission of Hubei province, China, on December 31, 2019 (Fig 1).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] Although 27 patients were initially announced to be afflicted with this mysterious disease, the number rose to 41 with seven critically ill patients; one death was noted in the subsequent report on January 11, 2020.20 The Chinese authorities reporting to WHO stated that some of the patients were operating dealers or vendors in the Huanan seafood market, which was subsequently reported to be selling live and freshly slaughtered hunted animals.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] Several reports of clusters of cases among families and infection of 16 health care workers pointed to human-to-human transmission of the virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]",
            "Despite recognition of the outbreak within a few weeks by the Chinese using their efficient surveillance network and laboratory infrastructure, efforts to prevent the spread of this virus were not sufficient; as of February 3, 2020, at least 17 496 cases with a death toll of 362 in more than 25 countries have been reported (Fig 2).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] With a crowded population eclipsing that of New York City by more than 2.5 million and its role as one of China's major transportation hubs, the city of Wuhan was the ideal breeding ground for an outbreak.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] Peak travel season due to the Chinese New Year was probably an important factor that led to the global spread of the infection.",
            "In a study of 425 cases infected up to January 4, the basic reproductive number, or R0, of the virus was estimated to be approximately 2.2.26 This means that each patient can, on average, spread the infection to more than two healthy persons. This number was around 3 for the SARS-CoV outbreak, which was eventually contained as a result of efficient infection control measures.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] Presence of cases with mild clinical presentation and lack of www.theijoem.com  Vol 11, Num 2; April, 2020",
            "Overall, infection caused by the 2019nCoV shares many clinical similarities with infection caused by SARS-CoV. A typical human coronavirus has an incubation period of 2\u20134 days; it is estimated to be 3\u20136 days for the 2019-nCoV, and 4\u20136 days for SARS-CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] Infection with 2019-nCoV, similar to SARS-CoV, presents with non-specific symptoms such as malaise, fever, and dry cough at the prodromal phase.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] In a study of 425 patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, the mean duration from illness onset to the first medical visit was 5.8 (95% CI 4.3 to 7.5) days for cases with disease onset before January 1, 2020, and 4.6 (95% CI 4.1 to 5.1) days for patients with illness onset between January 1 and 11.26 A report by Huang, et al, on 41 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection who were admitted to Wuhan Hospital indicated that fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%) were the most common presenting signs and symptoms.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] In another report from China, these findings were corroborated.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] In contrast to patients with typical human coronavirus infections, few of those affected with the www.theijoem.com  Vol 11, Num 2; April, 2020",

            "In the wake of the peak of influenza and other respiratory viral infections in the northern hemisphere and nonspecific clinical findings resembling other cases of viral pneumonia, early detection of those infected with 2019-nCoV is an onerous task for health care professionals around the globe.",
            "Eliciting the exposure history of suspicious cases could have been an effective strategy in the earlier stages of the outbreak in China. However, the global spread of the virus and human-to-human transmission seen in recent weeks have made the situation more complicated.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] In general, infected patients had a median age ranging from 49 to 61 years; male individuals are more frequently infected.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] Lack of serious disease in children is also a feature of SARS-CoV infection, and a feature of some (but not all) coronavirus infections in other species.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Immune-related genes on the X chromosome and sex hormones, which influence both innate and adaptive immune responses, might explain the higher susceptibility to the infection in males.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] Higher likelihood of exposure to the virus due to occupational risk could be another contributory factor.",
            "The full genomic sequence of the 2019nCoV was released shortly after the start of the outbreak to public databases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] This, in turn, paved the way for the development of PCR assays to detect the virus. Rapid collection and nucleic acid amplification testing of appropriate respiratory samples (ie, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab in outpatient cases and sputum and/or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with more critical conditions) for suspicious cases are currently recommended by WHO.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]",

        "Conclusion": [
            "The novel coronavirus, which comes from a viral family that was thought to be rather benign before the turn of the century, has led to a public health emergency of international concern according to WHO.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>] Outbreaks like this highlight the importance of effective public health strategies to counteract the never-ending threats imposed by emerging pathogens."
