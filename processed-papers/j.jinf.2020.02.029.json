            "In conclusion, there is growing evidence suggesting that severe infection caused by the novel Coronavirus emerged in 2019 induces L-CAP. The presence of L-CAP suggests the existence of immunological dysregulation as an accompanying event of the critical illness caused by this virus. Early recognition of this immunological phenotype could be useful to assist prompt recognition of severe patients. Should lymphopenia play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease, drugs targeting lymphocyte proliferation or apoptosis (IL-7, PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors) could help to prevent lymphopenia or restore lymphocyte counts in severe patients suffering COVID-19. The potential role of endothelial dysfunction as predisposing and pathogenic actor in this disease merits investigation. Biomarkers / tests assessing endothelial function could also help to early identify severe cases of COVID-19. Drugs improving endothelial dysfunction such adrecizumab could play a role in its treatment. Preclinical works on animal models should contribute to elucidate the true role of lymphopenia and endothelial dysfunction in this disease.

            "Running title: Lymphopenia in severe COVID-19 infection Jes\u00fas F Bermejo-Martin 1,2,3, Raquel Almansa 1,2,3, Rosario Men\u00e9ndez 3,4, Ra\u00fal Mendez[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], David J Kelvin 5,6 and Antoni Torres 3,7",
            "Corresponding author: Jes\u00fas F Bermejo-Martin, Group for Biomedical Research in Sepsis (BioSepsis), Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica de Salamanca (IBSAL), Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, 37007",
            "In two recent articles from Huang C et al and Yang X in The Lancet 2 3, 85% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 showed lymphopenia."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "The presence of lymphopenia as a signature of severe COVID-19 was confirmed by Wang D et al, who, in their study published in JAMA, reported that ICU patients suffering this infection had a median lymphocyte count of 800 cells/mm[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>], with non survivors exhibiting persistent lymphopenia 4.",
            "These features fit the characteristics of a particular immunological phenotype of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), lymphopenic CAP (L-CAP), which, as the authors recently demonstrated in an article published in the Journal of Infection, is associated with increased severity, mortality and a dysregulated immunological response 7.",
            "As the authors recently reviewed in J Clin Med, endothelial dysfunction induces disassembly of intercellular junctions, endothelial cell death and blood-tissue barrier disruption, along with enhanced leukocyte adhesion and extravasation, which could contribute to explain the lymphopenia observed in severe COVID-19 patients 9.",
            "Recent findings from the group have evidenced the interconnection between lymphopenia and endothelial dysfunction in patients with CAP and organ failure 10.",
            "In aged individuals with chronic diseases, these features could represent predisposing factors for presenting a severe respiratory failure following COVID-19 infection.",
            "Finding new biomarkers that can be used at the earliest stages of hospitalization to identify those individuals with COVID-19 who will become critically ill will be important for efficient management of ICU resources.",
            "In areas with sustained circulation of the new Coronavirus, evaluation of lymphocyte counts in patients with CAP could help to identify and prioritize those individuals who require or will shortly require critical care."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "There is growing evidence suggesting that severe infection caused by the novel Coronavirus emerged in 2019 induces L-CAP.",
            "Should lymphopenia play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease, drugs targeting lymphocyte proliferation or apoptosis (IL-7, PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors) could help to prevent lymphopenia or restore lymphocyte counts in severe patients suffering COVID-19.",
            "Preclinical works on animal models should contribute to elucidate the true role of lymphopenia and endothelial dysfunction in this disease."
