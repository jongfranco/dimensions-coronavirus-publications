Hence, effective medicines for fighting against grouper Iridovirus are urgently needed. The possible application of Curcuma kwangsiensis ingredients against SGIV\u2010Gx infection was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in this study. The safe working concentration of each C. kwangsiensis ingredient was identified (C. kwangsiensis ethanol ingredient, CKEE \u22645 mg/ml; curcumin \u226420 \u03bcg/ml; curdione \u2264500 \u03bcg/ml; curcumenol \u2264500 \u03bcg/ml; curcumol displayed no cytotoxic effects even at 2 mg/ml) in vitro and in vivo. The inhibitory activities of each C. kwangsiensis ingredient against SGIV\u2010Gx infection were analysed using aptamer (Q2)\u2010based fluorescent molecular probe (Q2\u2010AFMP) and RT\u2010qPCR. The results showed that C. kwangsiensis ingredient (CKEE, curcumin, curcumol, curdione and curcumenol) displayed antiviral activities against SGIV\u2010Gx infection in a dose\u2010dependent manner. Furthermore, according to the inhibitory percentage analysed using RT\u2010qPCR results, CKEE and curdione had the best antiviral activity against SGIV\u2010Gx above 93%. Overall, the results suggest that some C. kwangsiensis ingredients have excellent antiviral effects, making it an interesting candidate for developing effective medicines for preventing and controlling SGIV\u2010Gx outbreaks in mariculture.",
