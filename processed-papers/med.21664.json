        "abstract": "Direct\u2010acting antiviral agents (DAAs) represent a class of drugs targeting viral proteins and have been demonstrated to be very successful in combating viral infections in clinic. However, DAAs suffer from several inherent limitations, including narrow\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles and liability to drug resistance, and hence there are still unmet needs in the treatment of viral infections. In comparison, host targeting antivirals (HTAs) target host factors for antiviral treatment. Since host proteins are probably broadly required for various viral infections, HTAs are not only perceived, but also demonstrated to exhibit broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities. In addition, host proteins are not under the genetic control of viral genome, and hence HTAs possess much higher genetic barrier to drug resistance as compared with DAAs. In recent years, much progress has been made to the development of HTAs with the approval of chemokine receptor type 5 antagonist maraviroc for human immunodeficiency virus treatment and more in the pipeline for other viral infections. In this review, we summarize various host proteins as antiviral targets from a medicinal chemistry prospective. Challenges and issues associated with HTAs are also discussed.",

Several clinical trials of 32 for the treatment of other viral infections are also ongoing. In a pilot clinical trial of 32 for the treatment of chronic HBV, the serum HBV DNA of eight of nine patients became undetectable after 4 to 20 weeks of treatment with 32, and more importantly, three out of nine subjects became HBeAg negative, which is a rare outcome for current standard of care. This proof\u2010of\u2010concept study presented 32 as a very promising drug to achieve a HBV cure.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] was also tested in clinical trials against HCV infections, and it showed very pronounced efficacy either as monotherapy or in combination with IFN\u2010\u03b1 and RBV. For example, administration of 500 mg 32 twice a day for 48 weeks with 180 \u03bcg of IFN\u2010\u03b1 once weekly from week 13 to 48 achieved a SVR of 79% in patients infected with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 4, as compared to 50% for IFN\u2010\u03b1 and RBV. However, the development of 32 as an anti\u2010HCV drug was not further pursued due to the approval of several new DAAs, despite that 32 has much higher genetic barrier to resistance as compared to DAAs"

            "Abstract Direct\u2010acting antiviral agents (DAAs) represent a class of drugs targeting viral proteins and have been demonstrated to be very successful in combating viral infections in clinic. However, DAAs suffer from several inherent limitations, including narrow\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles and liability to drug resistance, and hence there are still unmet needs in the treatment of viral infections. In comparison, host targeting antivirals (HTAs) target host factors for antiviral treatment. Since host proteins are probably broadly required for various viral infections, HTAs are not only perceived, but also demonstrated to exhibit broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities. In addition, host proteins are not under the genetic control of viral genome, and hence HTAs possess much higher genetic barrier to drug resistance as compared with DAAs. In recent years, much progress has been made to the development of HTAs with the approval of chemokine receptor type 5 antagonist maraviroc for human immunodeficiency virus treatment and more in the pipeline for other viral infections. In this review, we summarize various host proteins as antiviral targets from a medicinal chemistry prospective. Challenges and issues associated with HTAs are also discussed.",

            "Viral infections still represent a major global public health problem. Although hundreds of viruses are known to be pathogenic, only less than 10 of them can be treated in clinic with available antiviral drugs. For some highly pathogenic virus such as Zika (ZIKV), Ebola (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), as well as many others, there is still no effective drugs on market against them. Most of the antiviral drugs approved are designed to target viral proteins to inhibit viral infections, and they are named as direct\u2010acting antiviral agents (DAAs).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] DAAs have been demonstrated to be very successful in clinic to combat viral infections, and are generally considered as very safe for human use because most of the targeted viral proteins have no human homologs. However, viral polymerases, one of the hottest targets for antiviral design, do share some structural similarity with their human counterparts, especially at the active sites, which is the major underlying reason for the toxicity observed with nucleoside\u2010based antivirals. In addition, viral proteins do not normally share structural similarity among different species or even genotypes of virus, and hence one antiviral agent targeting a specific viral protein can hardly impart the same inhibitory effects against the other virus. Consequently, the antiviral drugs available on market can barely be employed to treat newly emerging virus, and the magnitude of this problem is further exacerbated by the lack of broad\u2010spectrum antiviral drugs on market. The other inherent limitation of DAAs is that DAAs, in most cases, have low genetic barrier to drug resistance because they act directly on viral proteins, and the resulted selective pressure will facilitate the mutations of virus during replication, which will make the virus refractory to the treatment of DAAs.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] Altogether, there still exist great unmet needs for the treatment of viral infections, and new antivirals with broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities as well as new mechanism of action are highly demanded.",
            "It is widely known that viruses are unable to complete their replication without the help of the host. They will hijack various host proteins or pathways throughout their replication cycle to facilitate their replication, and hence the inhibition or knockdown of such host proteins will block viral replication. Therefore, host proteins as such are potential antiviral targets for drug development. The host targeting antivirals (HTAs) are complementary to the DAAs, and are superior to DAAs from several aspects. Chiefly, a specific host protein might play crucial roles in the replication of several types of viruses, and thereby its inhibition will yield broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities. HTAs as such are likely to be effective against newly emerging virus, because they may also leverage on the same host protein for replication. For example, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a host chaperone responsible for the folding, assembly, and maturation of endogenous proteins, is also found to be crucial for maturation of many viral proteins, and therefore, Hsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>] inhibitors are endowed with broad\u2010 spectrum antiviral activities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Altogether, targeting host factors is a very promising strategy with possibility to address the critical challenges faced with the DAAs. In this review, we summarize the recent advances made in HTAs from a medicinal chemistry standpoint, and the host targets are generally classified into three different categories based on the development stage of their corresponding inhibitors/modulators, namely the ones which reached Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, that have entered clinical trials and those in preclinical studies. The focus is mainly placed on the small\u2010 molecule based HTAs, and the antibody or small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2010based strategy will not be included. For several well\u2010studied host targets with quite a lot of known inhibitors, because each one can stand alone as an independent review, and this review is not intended to be comprehensive, so for such targets, only a selection of representative inhibitors will be presented to discuss related issues.",
            "It should be noted that chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonist but not chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) antagonist has reached FDA approval. However, CXCR4 is discussed in this section because it is closely related to",
            "CCR5. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 belong to the superfamily of G\u2010protein\u2010coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains, and both are involved in the entrance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] The glycoprotein 120 (gp120) on the surface of HIV envelop will bind to the CD4 receptor on the surface of T lymphocytes, leading to the conformation change of gp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c120\" href=\"#r120\">120</a>]. The gp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c120\" href=\"#r120\">120</a>] will then bind to coreceptor CXCR4, CCR5, or both to facilitate the entrance of HIV virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] HIV\u20101 virus can thus be broadly classified into three types based on the coreceptor tropism, namely the X4\u2010, R5\u2010, and dual\u2010tropic viruses. The feasibility of targeting CXCR4 or CCR5 for HIV therapy is supported by the fact that CCR5 mutations confer the host with resistance to HIV infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] Ample studies have demonstrated that CXCR4 antagonists can block HIV\u20101 infection through CXCR4.7,8 Generally, CXCR4 antagonist can be divided into two types: peptide and nonpeptide based. The peptide\u2010based antagonists were designed using the natural chemokines of CXCR4 as template, such as stromal cell\u2010derived factor 1\u03b1 (SDF\u20101\u03b1) and viral macrophage inflammatory protein II (vMIP\u2010II), both of which can bind to and then activate CXCR4 to initiate downstream signaling pathway. For example, peptide V1 (1; Figure 1) was derived from the first 1 to 21 residues of VMIP\u2010II, and it can block the interaction between CXCR4 and HIV\u20101, and thereby inhibit the entry of both X4\u2010 and dual\u2010tropic HIV\u20101 virus. Interestingly, replacement of all the residues in 1 with all D\u2010amino acid lead to much more potent antiviral activities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Due to the inherent limitation with the peptide\u2010based antagonist, several nonpeptide based antagonists have been developed. AMD3100 (2) was discovered by random screening, and it inhibited HIV\u20101 infection by disrupting the interaction between CXCR4 and HIV\u20101.10 Encouragingly, it showed antiviral efficacy in X4 HIV\u20101\u2010infected patients in a phase II clinical trial. However, compound 2 lacks oral bioavailability due to its high positive charge, and cardiotoxicity was also reported in the clinical trial.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] The structural optimization identified AMD3465 (3) with just one macrocyclic structure retained. This compound retained all the biological profiles of 2, and it showed improved antiviral activity (IC50: 1\u201010 nM). It also inhibited the replication of drug\u2010resistant virus strain (zidovudine).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] AMD070 (4), a noncyclam derivative, was discovered by AnorMED as a new CXCR4 antagonist. It showed much improved oral bioavailability (rat: 20%; dog: 80%), but hepatotoxicity was observed in preclinical studies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] Further structural optimization led to GSK812397 (5) without the basic sidechain. It showed potent anti\u2010 HIV\u20101 activity with an IC50 value of 1.5 nM, and it did not show any detectable toxicity (>1000 nM) in in vitro assay. In addition, 5 also presented acceptable pharmacokinetic profiles with the oral bioavailability in the range between 10% and 21% among different species.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Further structural modification with constraining conformation (6) and/or opening up the tetrahydroquinoline ring (7) resulted in a series of new derivatives with retained anti\u2010HIV activities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] However, none of these compounds have been advanced into clinical trials.",
            "Although compound 2, also known as plerixafor, was approved by the FDA for autologous transplantation in patients with non\u2010Hodgkin's lymphoma or multiple myeloma,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] no CXCR4 antagonist has been approved for the treatment of HIV infections. The underlying reasons are at least twofold: one major concern with the CXCR4 antagonist is the toxicity issue, especially that CXCR418,19 or SDF\u20101\u03b120 knockout mice die prenatally with multiple neurological, cardiac/vascular, and hematopoietic defects. Such potential adverse outcomes are exacerbated in the case of HIV treatment, wherein a life\u2010long treatment is required; the other minor issue with these CXCR4 antagonists is the lack of oral bioavailability. IV injection is not practical in the case of HIV treatment, because this will definitely hurt the compliance of the patients.",
            "In comparison, the development of CCR5 antagonists for HIV treatment is much more successful. One CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (8; Figure 2) has been approved by FDA as HIV entry inhibitor in 2007.21 With a long plasma half\u2010life (15\u201023 hours),[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] is administrated orally once daily. The clinical data showed that 8 is well tolerated in patients and it can significantly repress the viral load in R5\u2010infected HAART\u2010treatment experienced patients. Moreover, it is active against 200 clinically derived HIV\u20101 envelope\u2010recombinant pseudoviruses, with 100 of them being resistant to existing drug classes, demonstrating the merits of HTAs.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] In the clinic, it is primarily recommended for the patients infected with R5\u2010tropic HIV virus, and a tropism test (although not approved by FDA) is highly required to determine the viral tropism population within the patient before the treatment to ensure treatment success. The first generation of the test (known as TROFILE) failed to distinguish R5 from R5/X4 mixed tropism, resulting in significant drug failure in clinic in R5/X4\u2010infected patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] Therefore, 8 is just designated as a backup regimen, despite that a new reliable and cost\u2010efficient tropism test is available in clinic now. Interestingly, the combination of 8 with raltegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine led to faster reduction of 2\u2010long term repeat (2\u2010LTR+) newly infected cells and recovery of CD4+ T\u2010cell counts after 48 weeks of treatment,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] and 8 in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors is being tested in clinic for preexposure prophylaxis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] However, the use of 8 is accompanied with severe side effects, and in some cases even life\u2010threatening conditions such as hepatotoxicity and heart attack were observed. To mitigate these limitations, the second generation of CCR5 antagonists have been developed. Two clinical candidates vicriviroc (9) 27 and aplaviroc (10) 28 have made to phase II trials. However, the studies were halted",
            "|5 due to insufficient efficacy and observed hepatotoxicity for 9 and 10, respectively. Much of the subsequent medicinal chemistry effort is devoted to the structural modification toward 8 to 10, aiming to improve either efficacy and/or ADME profiles. For example, Pfizer discovered compound 8's structural analogue PF\u2010232798 (11),[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] which showed not only potent anti\u2010HIV activity (IC50: 2.0 nM) and moderate hERG inhibition (IC50: 12 \u03bcM), but also superior oral bioavailability as compared to 8. In addition, compound 11 is also active against maraviroc\u2010resistant HIV\u20101 isolate strain CC185. The data from phase\u2010II trials demonstrated its superior safety in patients with no adverse effects observed at a dosage up to 250 mg. However, no further data were disclosed after that.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] GSK 163929 (12) with a 4,4\u2010disubstituted piperidine scaffold exhibited potent anti\u2010HIV activity and excellent pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles, but it did not progress to clinic trials due to toxicity concerns.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] The other two representative new scaffolds derived from compound 8 are monocyclic piperidine amides and cyclic and acyclic urea\u2010piperidines. Some representative candidate compounds from these two series are shown in Figure 2. Among these compounds, only TAK\u2010220 (13) was progressed to phase\u2010I clinical trials.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] However, no further update about the status of compound 13 has been reported. Inspired by the scaffold of 9 and 10, several new CCR5 antagonists have been devised as depicted in Figure 2.33 The most promising antagonist among this series is the one developed by Incyte based on the structure of 10. INCB9471 (16) showed potent antiviral activity against R5 HIV\u20101 strains at IC50 values in sub\u2010nanomolar range. In addition, it presented excellent PK profiles with oral bioavailability being 100% and 95% in rat and dog, respectively.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] As such, 16 has been advanced to phase II trials, and the data showed that it was well\u2010tolerated in humans. However, its clinical studies were halted due to business issues. Besides the chemotypes described above, CCR5 antagonists with miscellaneous scaffolds have also been discovered, yet none of them have made to clinical trials.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]",
            "Targeting CXCR4 or CCR5 alone for HIV treatment possesses several downsides. Chiefly, a tropism test is required before the treatment, and tropism shifts are frequently observed in both treatment\u2010experienced and treatment\u2010naive HIV\u2010infected patients. Therefore, a dual antagonist against both CXCR4 and CCR5 would be perfect to mitigate these limitations. The first dual\u2010tropic inhibitor AMD3451 (17; Figure 3) with N\u2010pyridinylmethyl cyclam scaffold was discovered in 2004. It was moderately active against not only X4\u2010 and R5\u2010tropic HIV strains but also dual \u2010tropic HIV strains with IC50 in the range of 1 to 30 \u03bcM.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] Although 17 is not potent enough for further development, it established the proof of concept of targeting CXCR4 and CCR5 simultaneously for HIV\u20101 treatment.",
            "Ribavirin (18; Figure 4) is an approved antiviral drug used in clinic to treat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and viral hemorrhagic fever. Although its specific antiviral mechanism of action",
            "remains largely uncertain, it is widely accepted that it elicits its antiviral efficacy via modulating host pathways. For example, 18 showed moderate inhibitory potency against inosine\u20105\u2032\u2010monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) with a Ki value of around 250 nM, which is believed to be highly involved in the replication of various viruses (see below). In addition, several other mechanism of actions have also been proposed and evidenced: (a) direct inhibition of RNA polymerase by converting 18 to its triphosphate form to competitively bind to the nucleotides binding site in RNA polymerase[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]; (b) 18 can act as a mutagen by inserting into the viral RNA to push the virus beyond the threshold of error catastrophe[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]; (c) 18 shows immunomodulatory effect of shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype, which helps to clear virus infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>] Although the combination of 18 and interferon 2\u03b1 (IFN\u20102\u03b1) used to be the SOC for HCV treatment, it is notorious for several severe side effects. One major adverse effect associated with the use of is hemolytic anemia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>] To alleviate this unwanted effect, taribavirin (19) was developed as the prodrug of 18. Ideally, can be metabolized to 18 mainly in the liver to target HCV\u2010infected hepatocytes, and hence the distribution of within red blood cells will be significantly decreased, and thereby the development of hemolytic anemia will be subsequently eliminated. Indeed, the clinical data from phase III trials revealed that patients receiving (fixed dosage 600 mg, BID) and IFN showed significantly lower rates of anemia as compared to the ones in (1000\u20101200 mg) and IFN group (5.3% vs 24%).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>] However, the sustained virologic response (SVR) rates for and 18 group are 38% and 52%, respectively, failing to demonstrate the noninferiority end point for efficacy. The ViSER\u20102 trials also failed to meet the noninferiority end points.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]",
            "With the approval of several DAAs such as sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, the treatment of HCV in clinic has been significantly revolutionized, and several both ribavirin (RBV)\u2010 and IFN\u2010free regimens have been approved with better efficacy and safety profiles as compared to the old SOC. Initially, it was expected that the HCV treatment would not benefit much from the combination of RBV with other DAAs due to the safety concern associated with RBV. However, very interestingly, it has been found recently that RBV remained an indispensable component for the optimal treatment for some difficult\u2010to\u2010cure subgroups of HCV patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>] For example, in a phase 3 C\u2010EDGE studies, the combination of RBV with elbasvir/grazoprevir achieved much higher SVR (12 weeks, 93% [14/15] vs 78% [7/9]; 16 weeks, 100% [8/8] vs 60% [3/5], respectively) as compared to the group without RBV in patients infected with genotype 4 HCV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>] In addition, RBV increased the barrier to resistance, especially in patients receiving DAAs with low barriers to resistance. Importantly, the combination of RBV with DAAs showed much improved safety and tolerability as compared with the combination with IFN, and the frequency and severity of anemia is significantly reduced with an adverse effect\u2010induced discontinuation rate of less than 3%.45 Nevertheless, the last generations HCV DAAs (including glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/ voxilaprevir) are highly effective in most cases without any need to use RBV.",
            "Cyclophilins are a family of cellular peptidyl\u2010prolyl cis\u2010trans isomerases (PPIase) and are involved in many cellular processes. The important roles cyclophilin A (CypA) plays during HCV replication were found by an unexpected clinical finding. Cyclosporin A (CsA; 20; Figure 5), which shows high binding affinity to CypA, is an approved immunosuppressive drug. In a clinical trial for CsA's therapeutic potential against hepatitis\u2010associated inflammation, it was unexpectedly found that a significantly more potent antiviral response was observed in the combination group of CsA and IFN\u2010\u03b12b as compared with the IFN\u2010\u03b12b alone group.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>] The function of CypA in the replication of HCV was subsequently confirmed in vitro.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>] The main cellular function of Cyps is to convert the conformation (trans\u2010 to cis\u2010form) of prolines in the protein, which is essential for trafficking of many proteins and forming protein complexes, and these functions are also indispensable for the replication of HCV. Therefore, it is anticipated that the CypA inhibitors will show anti\u2010HCV activity. Although 20 is an approved drug, its main indication is suppressing",
            "immunoreaction after organ transplantation, which is an unwanted \u201cside\u2010effect\u201d for antivirals. Fortunately, the immnosuppressive effect of 20 is attributed to the inhibition of calcineurin (CN) but not CypA, and hence it is feasible to eliminate the immnosuppressive effect while retaining the anti\u2010HCV activity by making new CsA analogues. NIM811 (21) is one of such analogues with a methyl\u2010isoleucine at position 4 of CsA. It showed anti\u2010HCV activity in vitro with an IC50 value of 0.12 \u03bcM, whereas its immunosuppressive effect was completely eliminated.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>] The phase I clinical trial showed that 21 is well\u2010tolerated with no obvious adverse effects observed. However, in a subsequent double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study, the monotherapy with 21 failed to yield significant viral load reduction in genotype 1 HCV\u2010infected patients. The underlying reason is attributed to a relatively low trough concentration (0.47 \u03bcM) at a dosage of 600 mg (BID), which is lower than the IC50 value (1.5 \u03bcM) of 21 against HCV in the presence of serum, and the dosage elevation did not result in proportional exposure.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>] Therefore, the clinical trial with 21 is not continued.",
            "Alisporivir (22) is a more potent nonimmunosuppressive CsA analogue with an anti\u2010HCV IC50 values of 0.045 and 0.33 \u03bcM in the absence and presence of serum, respectively. In addition, it is much more difficult to develop resistance against 22 both in vitro and in patients, as compared to other DAAs.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>] In phase II trial, 22 was studied in combination with RBV as an IFN\u2010free regimen in genotype 2 and 3 patients, and about half of the patients receiving 22 (800 mg, QD) plus RBV, and one\u2010third of those receiving 22 only (1000 mg QD) were cured with a SVR.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>] However, unfortunately, in a pivotal phase III trial designed to study the combination of 22 with RBV and PEG\u2010IFN\u2010 \u03b12a in treatment\u2010naive, genotype 1 HCV patients, six cases of severe pancreatitis along with one death were reported, and the clinical trial with 22 was then put on hold. It is worth noting that all the severe side effects were observed in the triple\u2010therapy aim including RBV and PEG\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b12a, both of which are notorious for their adverse effects, while the monotherapy with 22 or the IFN\u2010free regimen did not result in the same side effects.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]",
            "To mitigate the observed side effects with 21 and 22, the third generation of CsA derivatives have been developed. The representative candidate compound from this series is SCY\u2010635 (23) with a dimethylaminoethylthio substituent at position 3 and a hydroxyl group at the \u03b3 position of the 4\u2010N\u2010methyl leucine residue. 23 showed potent anti\u2010HCV activity in vitro with an EC50 and EC90 value of 0.1 and 0.3 \u03bcM, respectively, and exhibited synergistic effect with IFN\u2010\u03b1 and additive effect with RBV. It also showed low potential for drug\u2010drug interaction with no obvious induction on the major cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2, 2B6, and 3A4. In addition, 23 also showed acceptable PK profiles with an oral bioavailability of around 20% in rat and monkey.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>] As such, 23 has been advanced into clinical trials. In patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, 900 mg/day of 23 achieved a decline in plasma viremia by 2.2log 10 after 15 days.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>] It is interesting to note that 23 showed totally different side effects from those of 21 and 22, indicating that the adverse effects may not be associated with the inhibition of Cyps, but are likely resulted from the off\u2010target effects of individual inhibitors.",
            "Non\u2010CsA based Cyps inhibitors have also been discovered. Sanlifehins (SFA) including sanlifehin A (24), B (25), C (26), and D (27) are a class of natural occurring polyketides isolated from the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. strain A92\u2010308110. SFAs were identified as Cyps inhibitors with stronger potency as compared to CsA derivatives, particular 25, of which the inhibitory potency against all Cyps was 30\u2010 to 50\u2010fold more potent than 20. It also showed much more potent antiviral activity in vitro with an EC50 value of 70 nM against HCV genotype 1b. Interestingly, albeit slightly less potent as compared to against the wild type, 24, 26, and 27 retained inhibitory effect against CsA\u2010resistant Huh 9 to 13 subgenomic replicon with EC50 values ranging from 3.3 to 6.8 \u03bcM.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>] However, the PK studies revealed that SFA suffered from poor water solubility (<25 \u03bcM) and poor oral bioavailability (<4%). Moreover, SFA possessed undesirable immunosuppressive activity via an unknown mechanism.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>] Structural modifications have been made to 24, and it was revealed that only the macrocyclic moiety was essential for the Cyps inhibition, and modification on the sidechain had little effect on the binding affinity.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>] Removal of the spirolactam moiety on the sidechain of 24 only led to the loss of immunosuppressive activity but not the Cyps inhibition. Such structure\u2010activity relationships are very important for further optimization of SFA as anti\u2010HCV agents (Figure 6).",
            "Both CsA and SFA derivatives are macrocyclic molecules with large molecular size, and as such both suffered from some limitations, including poor cell membrane permeability, high risk of drug\u2010drug interactions and off\u2010target toxicity, and synthetic inaccessibility for structural optimization and manufacturing. In 2016, a new family of nonpeptide based small\u2010molecule Cyps inhibitors have been designed using fragment\u2010based strategy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>] The crystal structure of CypA indicated that its PPIase catalytic site consisted of hydrophobic, aromatic, and polar residues, next to the catalytic site is a deep pocket called gatekeeper site, which might contribute to the substrate binding specificity (Figure 7). A total of 34 409 fragments were docked into these two sites, and several fragments were identified to bind to these two sites separately. Eventually, fragment 28 and 29 from each binding site were selected and connected together by a urea linkage to yield compound 30 (Figure 8), which showed potent inhibitory effect against CypA and B with IC50 values of 13 and 6 \u03bcM, respectively. Further structural optimization identified compound 31 with much\u2010improved potency. Its IC50 values against CypA, B, and D ranged from 0.08 to 0.2 \u03bcM, FIGURE 6 The chemical structures of sanlifehin A\u2010D [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]",
            "|9 which was around 10\u2010fold less potent than 20. Compound 31 together with other analogues showed definitive antiviral activity against a panel of viruses including HCV (genotype 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 2a/4a, and 5a), HIV, human coronavirus 229E, dengue virus (DENV), ZIKV, and YFV in vitro with IC50 values ranging from 0.4 to 44 \u03bcM.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>] Mutations at Ns5A (D320E and R318H) did not increase the IC50 values of compound against HCV, indicating the advantage of high generic barrier to resistance by targeting Cyps. Although compound 31 is a less potent inhibitor against Cyps as compared to 20 and 22, it did not display any immunosuppressive effect and inhibition of IL\u20102 production in stimulated immortalized T lymphocytes (EC50 > 20\u03bcM). Altogether, these results presented this scaffold of Cyps inhibitors as a very promising starting point for further development.",
            "It has been well\u2010established that Cyps are involved in a broad range of viral infections, including HIV\u20101,60 influenza virus,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>] HBV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>] SARS coronavirus,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>] human cytomegalovirus (HCMV),[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c64\" href=\"#r64\">64</a>] papillomavirus,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c65\" href=\"#r65\">65</a>] and nidovirus,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>] among others. Therefore, it can be envisioned that Cyps inhibitors should exhibit broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity against these viruses.

            "It is widely known that virus will hijack a wide range of host factors to facilitate its replication. Meanwhile, the host has also evolved an innate immune system to counteract viral infections. Compounds with the capacity to mediate the host antiviral pathways are expected to confer broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity, and nitazoxanide (32; Figure 9) is such a compound that regulates several host antiviral pathways to convey broad\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles. 32 is originally an FDA approved drug for the treatment of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis in both adults and children, and it has been demonstrated to be well\u2010tolerated in humans with the",

Compound 33 showed broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity against a panel of viruses both in vitro and in vivo. To obtain new candidate compounds with improved potency and safety profiles, structural modifications were made to 32 primarily on the phenyl ring A and the thiazole moiety. It was revealed that electron\u2010withdrawing group such as nitro and chloro group at C\u20105 position was favorable for the antiviral activity, and replacement of the thiazole ring with phenyl ring retained the activity. The structural optimization led to the",
            "| 11 identification of a candidate compound RM\u20105038 (34) with a chloro group at the C\u20105 position, which showed comparable activity to that of 32 with EC50 values in the submicromolar range. 34 was considered to be superior as compared to 32 due to the replacement of the potential cytotoxicity nitro group in 32. 32 also suffers from poor systemic exposure after oral administration, and it is primarily biodistributed in the gastric intestinal tract, and excreted via urine and faeces. For antiviral therapy, it is preferred to increase the systemic exposure of the active drug. For such purpose, amino acid based prodrugs for 33 were devised,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>] and they showed much improved aqueous solubility as compared to the parent drug. As such, prodrug 35 exhibited significantly improved PK profiles with oral bioavailability being around 20% in rats, as compared to 2.8% and 0 for 32 and 33, respectively. In addition, 35 also showed preferable safety profiles in laboratory animals, with a no observed adverse effect level being 25 mg/kg/day for a consecutive 28 days in beagle dogs, and it did not present any obvious toxicity in rats after a single oral dosage of 300 mg/kg, and only minor toxicity on central nervous system and respiratory system was observed at a single dosage of 1000 mg/kg. All these PK results present 35 as a very promising candidate compound for further development, and it is now undergoing phase I clinical trial.",

Most viral envelope glycoproteins contain N\u2010linked glycans, and \u03b1\u2010glucosidase (especially endoplasmic reticulum [ER] \u03b1\u2010glucosidase) is highly involved in their proper folding and maturation. Therefore, the inhibition of ER \u03b1\u2010glucosidase would yield broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity. Indeed, ER \u03b1\u2010glucosidase inhibitors showed pronounced antiviral activity against a series of enveloped viruses both in vitro and in vivo including HIV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c87\" href=\"#r87\">87</a>] HCV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>] human coronavirus,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>] influenza A virus,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>] and DENV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>] Although \u03b1\u2010glucosidase is critical in the proper folding of viral envelop glycoproteins, it is less important to host cells, and the host cells can well\u2010tolerate the complete shutdown of these ER \u03b1\u2010glucosidase.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>] Moreover, several glucosidase inhibitors are being used in clinic for treating type II diabetes and Gaucher disease. Consequently, targeting \u03b1\u2010glucosidase for antiviral therapy would not raise a red flag on toxicity issues.",
            "To date, a wide range of \u03b1\u2010glucosidase inhibitors have been discovered,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c93\" href=\"#r93\">93</a>] among which the iminosugars are the most promising inhibitors as antiviral agents. It is widely accepted that the antiviral profiles of iminosugars is attributed to the inhibition of ER \u03b1\u2010glucosidases (I and II). The natural occurring iminosugars 1\u2010deoxynojirimycin (DNJ; 36; Figure 10) and castanospermine (37; Figure 10) has been used as starting points for further modifications. The modifications to 36 were primarily made at the amino position by introducing an alkyl chain. The n\u2010butylated DNJ 38 has been advanced to clinical trials for HIV treatment. In a phase II study, although 38 showed",

The other DNJ analogue Mon\u2010DNJ (39) also showed broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity, and it has recently been tested in human against DENV infection. In the phase I trial, has been demonstrated to be well\u2010tolerated in human with no severe side effects observed after a single dosage of 1000 mg, and the PK data indicated a low interindividual variability and good linearity over a wide range of dosage (NCT02061358). In a recent study, has been tested in a proof\u2010of\u2010concept non\u2010human primate trial against EBOV infections. However, failed to yield any survival benefit to macaques infected with EBOV\u2010 Makona, despite that showed definitive antiviral activity against EBOV in vitro.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>] Celgosivir (40), a prodrug of 37, has also been tested in human against dengue fever. In a phase Ib, placebo\u2010controlled study, failed to meet the primary end point in patients infected with uncomplicated dengue fever. However, in a mouse model study, it was confirmed that the dosing regime was crucial for the efficacy,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>] and therefore, a four\u2010time daily dosing regime is planned for a phase II trial (NCT02569827). was also studied for the treatment of patients infected with genotype I HCV.

            "Although the results from the clinical trials of 39 and 40 demonstrated the safety of iminosugars, they are all limited by poor PK profiles and insufficient efficacy. To address these limitations, further structural modifications were made to 36 by introducing various substituted alkyl sidechain, and several analogues were identified as potent antiviral activity against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), tacaribe virus, and DENV with EC50 values in the submicromolar range, which is hundreds fold more potent than 38. In addition, these compounds showed much superior PK profiles, especially compound 42, which had an oral bioavailability of 94%. Most importantly, they all demonstrated significant protective effects in both EBOV and BVDV infected mice models, and the in vivo glycan analysis also indicated significant ER \u03b1\u2010glucosidase suppression in the compounds treatment group.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c96\" href=\"#r96\">96</a>] It should be noted that the inhibition of other glucosidase such as intestinal glycosidase will lead to unwanted side effects. To avoid such side effects, a prodrug of compound 42 was designed by masking the free hydroxyl group by acylation. The tetrabutyrate prodrug 43 exhibited preferred stability toward simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, and yet was readily converted to the parent drug in the plasma and liver of mice. In a cell\u2010based assay, compound 43 showed inhibitory activity against EBOV with EC50 value of 15.6 \u03bcM, which is slightly less potent as compared with the parent compound (4.1 \u03bcM). Compound 43 also showed much improved overall drug exposure after either oral or intravenous administration to mice.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>] Another strategy to alleviate the side effects of iminosugars is to design more specific inhibitors toward ER \u03b1\u2010glucosidase. In 2016, the crystal structure of ER \u03b1\u2010glucosidase II in complex with 36 and 39 has been successfully resolved, which provided significant insights into the interactions between inhibitors and the active site of the enzyme, laying a firm foundation for the structure\u2010based drug design of more specific inhibitors.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c98\" href=\"#r98\">98</a>]",

Therefore, IMPDH inhibitors are expected to show broad\u2010 spectrum antiviral activities. Indeed, IMPDH inhibitors exhibited broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities against both DNA and RNA virus in vitro.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c100\" href=\"#r100\">100</a>] The approved non\u2010nucleoside\u2010based IMPDH inhibitors include mycophenolic acid (44), its prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (45) and mizoribine (46; Figure 11), and all of them were approved for prevention of organ transplant rejection, but not for antiviral therapy, Nevertheless, all these inhibitors were reported to inhibit the replication of a wide range of virus in vitro and even in vivo.

To overcome this limitation, a series of phenyloxazoles were developed by the Vertex group and others. The representative compound from this series is VX\u2010497 (47), which shows high affinity to IMPDH with a Ki value of 10 nM. It shows potent antiviral activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA virus including HBV, HCMV, RSV, and murine encephalomyocarditis virus, HCV, ZIKV, and EBOV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c103\" href=\"#r103\">103</a>] among others with IC50 values ranging from low micromolar to submicromolar levels, and its antiviral activity can be reversed by the addition of guanosine, indicating that its antiviral mechanism is resulted from IMPDH inhibition. Some other VX\u2010497 derivatives also exhibited similar antiviral profiles.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c104\" href=\"#r104\">104</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c105\" href=\"#r105\">105</a>] In light of the successful application of RBV in clinic for HCV treatment, as a more potent IMPDH inhibitor and antiviral agent as compared to RBV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c100\" href=\"#r100\">100</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>] has been evaluated in clinic for the treatment of HCV in combination with IFN\u2010\u03b1.

However, in a phase II triple combination study using 47, RBV, and IFN\u2010\u03b1 to treat genotype 1 CHC pegylated IFN and RBV nonresponders, the addition of 47 to IFN\u2010alfa\u20102a and RBV failed to increase the proportion of nonresponder patients with genotype 1 CHC achieving an SVR.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c107\" href=\"#r107\">107</a>] Due to the unsatisfactory results, the clinical trials of 47 for HCV treatment was discontinued. Although 47 is a very selective IMPDH inhibitor with potent anti\u2010HCV activity in vitro, it did not achieve similar magnitude of antiviral efficacy in patients. It is speculated that the level and supply of nucleotides varies in vitro and in vivo, and hence the dependence of viral replication on the de novo synthesis of nucleotides may be significantly different between in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it is expected that IMPDH inhibitors can only show limited efficacy in vivo, albeit with potent antiviral activities in vitro. One may argue that the success of RBV in the treatment of HCV has established IMPDH as a viable antiviral target. It should be noted that RBV is only a weak IMPDH inhibitor with a Ki value of around 250 nM, and it is widely accepted that other mechanisms are involved in the antiviral action of RBV. In addition, RBV has to be used in combination with IFN\u2010alpha or other anti\u2010HCV agents in clinic, and the monotherapy with RBV failed to yield any antiviral efficacy in patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c108\" href=\"#r108\">108</a>] Although quite a few other IMPDH inhibitors are under development, they are all intended for other indications. Consequently, special attentions should be paid to this issue in pursuit of IMPDH inhibitors as antiviral agents.",
            "Kinase represents a huge family of host proteins, and have been successfully targeted by a myriad of small\u2010 molecule inhibitors for the treatment of cancers and inflammatory diseases in clinic.

Since tremendous kinase inhibitors have been approved in clinic for treating cancer and inflammatory diseases, and more are under development in the pipelines, increasing efforts have been devoted to repurposing approved kinase inhibitors as broad\u2010spectrum antiviral agents. In this section, only one type of kinases along with their respective inhibitors are picked for the discussion of related issues, and the selection of these examples is not based on the \u201cimportance\u201d of the articles, but rather whether there are appropriate issues to discuss.",

Host kinases adaptor protein 2 (AP2)\u2010associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin G\u2010associated kinase (GAK), two kinases from this family, are found to regulate intracellular trafficking of a variety of viruses including DENV and EBOV. Two approved kinase inhibitors sunitinib (49) and erlotinib (50) were found to potently inhibit AAK1 and GAK, respectively, and both are reported to exhibit potent broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity in vitro. In addition, the combination of 49 and 50 showed very pronounced protective effects against morbidity and mortality in DENV and EBOV infection mouse models.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c112\" href=\"#r112\">112</a>] A cocktail treatment containing 49 and 50 against EBOV infection is being investigated in clinic trial, but no clinical data have been disclosed yet (NCT02380625). GAK and AAK1 were also reported to regulate the binding of AP2M1 to HCV core protein, which is essential to the HCV assembly. Inhibitors of GAK and AAK1 disrupted the interaction between AP2M1 and core, and thus inhibited HCV replication with EC50 values ranging from 0.15 to 1.8 \u03bcM.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c113\" href=\"#r113\">113</a>] Although 49 and 50 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against GAK and AAK1, both of which are known as pan\u2010 kinase inhibitors, and thus raise off\u2010target toxicity concerns when used as antiviral agents. In 2015, Herdewijn et al developed a series of highly selective inhibitors against GAK. The crystal structure of GAK in complex with one of these inhibitors has been resolved, showing that inhibitors as such behaved as classic type I adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\u2010competitive kinase inhibitors. These compounds showed pronounced anti\u2010HCV activity in vitro with EC50 in the low micromolar range.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c114\" href=\"#r114\">114</a>] Further structure optimization lead to the identification of compound 51 with a Kd value of 8.9 nM, which is endowed with broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity against a panel of viruses including DENV, EBOV, CHIKV with EC50 values in the low micromolar range. The mechanism of action studies confirmed that the inhibition of GAK is an important target underlying the broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activity of compound 51.115,116 The other chemotype of GAK inhibitor is quin(az)oline,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c117\" href=\"#r117\">117</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c118\" href=\"#r118\">118</a>] yet their antiviral activity was not probed.",

            "| 15 resistance, there still remain concerns or limitations for repurposing kinase inhibitors as antiviral agents. Chiefly, toxicity is the major concern associated with kinase inhibitor, because most of kinases (if not all) play essential roles to regulate the cellular functions. However, it should be noted that, in most cases, the duration of antiviral therapy can be as short as several weeks or even several days, and hence the incidence of severe side effects can be significantly decreased. In addition, the potential toxicity can be further diminished by operating in a well\u2010defined therapeutic window. Since most of the kinase inhibitors are designed to target the ATP binding site, which is highly conserved among different kinase families, so nearly all kinase inhibitors possess cross inhibitory activity against other kinases, which could be problematic. First, targeting multiple kinase may result in off\u2010target side effects; second, it is challenging to understand the mechanism underlying the antiviral action of these inhibitors because multiple kinases are involved. However, one could also argue that pan\u2010kinase inhibition is favorable for antiviral therapy in that the off\u2010target kinase(s) may also contribute to the viral replication, and targeting multiple kinases simultaneously may result in not only synergetic antiviral activity but also high genetic barrier to resistance as well. Altogether, targeting kinases represent a promising strategy for the development of antiviral agents, especially the ones with broad\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles and high genetic barrier to resistance.",

The most advanced inhibitor is Myrcludex B (MyrB), which is a synthetic N\u2010acylated lipopeptide pre\u2010 S1. It just completed phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients coinfected with HBV and HDV. The results showed that MyrB is well\u2010tolerated with bile acid increase as the only abnormal observation, and the bile acid level dropped to baseline after follow\u2010up week 1. The primary endpoint (HDV RNA reduction by 2log or negative) was achieved by 46.4%, 46.8%, 76.6%, and 3.3% of patients in arms A (2 mg), B (5 mg), C (10 mg), and D (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]), indicating a dose\u2010dependent antiviral efficacy of MyrB.

The mechanism of action studies showed that compound 58's anti\u2010HCV activity is FXR\u2010dependent. It has been reported that FXR agonist downregulated the expression of SRIB, which is a coreceptor for HCV entrance. As expected, the treatment of 92 also dose\u2010dependently decreased the level of SR\u2010BI.

It has been reported that lipid droplets are the major site for HCV particle assembly and production, and DGATs, especially DGAT\u20101, play vital roles during HCV infection. DGAT\u20101 forms a complex with nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) and core protein to enhance the interaction of the latter two, and the trafficking of NS5A to lipid droplets is also highly dependent on DGAT\u20101's activity.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c135\" href=\"#r135\">135</a>] The silence of DGAT\u20101 significantly impaired HCV entry.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c136\" href=\"#r136\">136</a>] Therefore, DGAT\u20101 could serve as a viable host target for anti\u2010HCV agents development.

The other possibility is that HCV virus hijacked other compensate pathway to facilitate the assembly and release while DGAT\u20101 activity is inhibited in vivo, or DGAT\u20101 plays a nonenzymatic roles during HCV replication, so the inhibition of its enzymatic activity would not yield any inhibitory activity against HCV replication.",

For instance, HSP90 is upregulated to activate Akt and nuclear factor \u03baB for viral gene expression upon HCMV infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c142\" href=\"#r142\">142</a>] As a chaperone protein, HSP90 is indispensable for the maturation, accurate folding, and maintenance of stability of various proteins including viral proteins. For example, HSP90 facilitates the accurate folding of NS5A of HCV virus in the replication complex to promote viral replication.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c143\" href=\"#r143\">143</a>] It can also help to maintain the stability of various viral proteins, including polymerases of VSV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c144\" href=\"#r144\">144</a>] CHIKV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c145\" href=\"#r145\">145</a>] and RSV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c146\" href=\"#r146\">146</a>] and ribonucleoprotein complex[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c147\" href=\"#r147\">147</a>] to facilitate viral genome replications.

Therefore, it can be anticipated that HSP90 inhibitors would present broad\u2010spectrum antiviral activities. Currently, there are up to 17 HSP90 inhibitors in clinical trials for cancer treatment, and most of them are N\u2010terminal ATP binding domain inhibitors.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c149\" href=\"#r149\">149</a>] This type of inhibitors competitively bind to the ATP binding site, and subsequently abolish the hydrolysis of ATP and HSP90's functions. Shown in Figure 9 are some representative HSP90 inhibitors, and the most famous one among this series is geldanamycin (GA; 63; Figure 16). 63 was first isolated from a fermentation broth of Streptomyces hygroscopicus in 1970, and was identified as the first HSP90 inhibitor binding to the N\u2010terminal ATP binding pocket. It was initially evaluated as an anticancer agent due to the important roles of HSP90 in multiple cancers. Because HSP90 also plays indispensable roles at different life cycle of viral replications, 63 was reported to exhibit antiviral activities against a wide range of viral infections, including HSV\u20102,150 HSV\u20101,151 HCMV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c142\" href=\"#r142\">142</a>] EBOV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c152\" href=\"#r152\">152</a>] HIV\u20101,153 and influenza virus,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c154\" href=\"#r154\">154</a>] among others. However, since 63 possesses several inherent limitations, such as poor water solubility and severe hepatotoxicity, structural modifications to 63 have been carried out.

For example, the observed cardiotoxicity mainly resulted from the inhibition HSP90\u03b1, which is responsible for the maturation of hERG channel.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c165\" href=\"#r165\">165</a>] Therefore, HSP90 isoform\u2010selective inhibitors are expected to side\u2010step some detrimental toxicity observed with pan\u2010inhibitors. Indeed, several HSP90 isoform\u2010selective inhibitors against Grp94166,167 (72\u201073) and HSP90\u03b2168 (71) have been successfully developed with much better safety profiles. These inhibitors were devised for cancer treatment, and their antiviral profiles were not investigated. Very recently, two GRP94 selective inhibitors 72 and 73 were found to inhibit the replication of DENV and ZIKV with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range, and it was further confirmed that GRP94 was essential for the replication of DENV and ZIKV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c169\" href=\"#r169\">169</a>] Therefore, it can be deduced that GRP94 might be indispensable for the replications of other viruses as well.

In addition, 82 is well\u2010tolerated in mice with no obvious toxicity at a single dosage of 1000 mg/kg (intraperitoneal [IP]).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c188\" href=\"#r188\">188</a>] Intensive structural modifications were further made to the sidechain and/or substituent at the nitrogen position of 82, yielding several analogues with IC50s against HCV in the low micromolar range (ie, 83).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c189\" href=\"#r189\">189</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c191\" href=\"#r191\">191</a>] The oxymatrine analogues were also shown to inhibit both wild\u2010type and lamivudine\u2010resistant HBV infection via downregulating Hsc[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>] expression with excellent safety profile in mice (LD50 = 750 mg/kg, oral administration).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c192\" href=\"#r192\">192</a>] The activity against other virus was also reported with oxymatrine analogues.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c193\" href=\"#r193\">193</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c194\" href=\"#r194\">194</a>] The other naturally occurring Hsc[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>] downregulator is lycorine (84).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c121\" href=\"#r121\">121</a>] It was reported to decrease the Hsc[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c70\" href=\"#r70\">70</a>] mRNA level does\u2010dependently with definitive anti\u2010HCV activity in vitro.

            "Host cells have developed an innate immune system to act as the first\u2010line defense against invading virus. In addition, a series of intracellular restriction factors are also expressed endogenously to counteract viral infections,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c197\" href=\"#r197\">197</a>] and apolipoprotein B mRNA\u2010editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide\u2010like 3G (APOBEC3G, A3G) is one such factor, which possesses the capacity to restrict the replication of a panel of viruses including HIV\u20101, HBV, HCV, and EV71 among others via different mechanisms. A3G is known as a cytidine deaminase, catalyzing the irreversible hydrolytic deamination of cytidine and deoxycytidine to uridine and deoxyuridine, respectively. Its anti\u2010HIV\u20101 activity is closely associated with its deaminase function, by which consistent mutation from dG to dA in the positive strand of viral DNA is frequently observed.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c198\" href=\"#r198\">198</a>] The high level of G to A mutation is attributed to the C to U transitions occurred on the complementary negative\u2010strand DNA by the cytidine deaminase activity of A3G. Introduction of deoxyuracils in the proviral DNA can ultimately lead to its cleavage and degradation by specific AP endonucleases. Additionally, high percentages of G to A mutation in the HIV\u20101 genome will result in the loss of functions of viral proteins.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c199\" href=\"#r199\">199</a>] Interestingly, the antiviral activity of A3G against other virus is independent of its deaminase activity. For example, A3G is reported to inhibit HCV replications by binding to the C\u2010terminus of HCV NS3 protein to reduce its helicase activity, which is essential for HCV replication.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c200\" href=\"#r200\">200</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c201\" href=\"#r201\">201</a>] A3G was also reported to inhibit HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo, but its anti\u2010HBV mechanism is not related to its deaminase activity, because A3G did not yield any G to A hypermutation within the HBV genome, and the catalytically inactive A3G derivatives were able to result in the same magnitude of HBV inhibition as compared with its wild\u2010type counterpart.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c202\" href=\"#r202\">202</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c203\" href=\"#r203\">203</a>]",

Therefore, agents either disrupting the formation of ubiquitin complex, stabilizing A3G or inducing the expression of A3G are expected to demonstrate antiviral activity. In 2008, Chen et al identified two compounds IMB\u201026 (86; Figure 18) and IMB\u201035 (87), which directly binds to A3G and disrupted its interaction with Vif, and therefore rescue A3G from Vif\u2010mediated degradation.

Most of the synthesized derivatives showed potent antiviral activity against HCV and EV71 virus with IC50 values ranging from 0.57 to 80 \u03bcM.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c207\" href=\"#r207\">207</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c208\" href=\"#r208\">208</a>] Since the amide linkage is liable to hydrolysis, a methylene group was inserted between the carbonyl and amino group. However, such modification resulted in complete loss of activity.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c207\" href=\"#r207\">207</a>] To further address this issue, a ring formation strategy was employed to generate compound with 2\u2010aryl\u2010isoindolin\u20101\u2010ones scaffold (88).

The immunoprecipitation experiment confirmed that neither compound disrupted the interaction between Vif and A3G, and thus inhibited the ubiquitination of A3G. In addition, neither compound impaired 20S proteasome activity, suggesting that recovery of A3G is not simply caused by inhibiting the general proteasome activities. The specific mechanism(s) underlying the recovery of A3G need further clarification.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c215\" href=\"#r215\">215</a>] Both compounds also showed high cytotoxicity toward 293T cells with IC50 values being 30 and 50 \u03bcM, respectively, necessitating further structural optimization. Benzimidazole derivatives were also identified as potent anti\u2010HIV\u20101 agents via stabilizing A3G.216 The structural modifications led to the identification of compound 93 with an anti\u2010HIV\u20101 IC50 value of 3.4 nM in H9 cells, and no toxicity in mice was observed in 2 weeks after the IP injection of 1000 mg/kg of compound 93. The mechanism of action studies showed that this type of compounds stabilized A3G via disrupting the interaction between Vif and ELOC, which is essential for the Vif\u2010mediated A3G degradation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c217\" href=\"#r217\">217</a>]",

The inhibition of the Vif and ELOC interaction will disrupt the formation of ubiquitin complex, and thus rescue the A3G from Vif\u2010mediated degradation. Indeed, treatment of 94 resulted in the elevation of A3G level, and reduced viral infectivity. 94 inhibited viral replications only in A3G positive cells with an IC50 value of 24.48 \u03bcM, confirming its A3G\u2010dependent antiviral mechanism. The coimmunoprecipitation and computational analysis suggested that 94 directly bound to ELOC at the interface of ELOC\u2010Vif interaction to suppress Vif activity.

Since the target of the BST\u20102 is not encoded by viral genome, so the virus cannot mutate the viral protein to evade the antiviral activity of BST\u20102. However, viruses have evolved other mechanisms to counteract the action of BST\u20102 by expressing different viral proteins to physically bind to BST\u20102, and thereby block the interaction between BST\u20102 and its target. Such proteins include HIV\u20101 Vpu, HIV\u20102 Env, SIV Env, SIV Nef, KSHV K5, and the EBOV glycoprotein. For example, HIV\u20101 Vpu, a type I integral membrane protein, can either induce the ubiquitination of BST\u20102 for degradation or downregulate the cell\u2010surface BST\u20102 level by sequestering the de novo synthesized BST\u20102 away from the plasma membrane to counteract its antiviral activity.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c226\" href=\"#r226\">226</a>] Therefore, it can be envisioned that disruption of the interaction between BST\u20102 and these viral proteins or stabilization of BST\u20102 could yield antiviral agents.

In 2012, Botta et al discovered the first inhibitor (97 and 98; Figure 20) targeting the RNA binding site of DDX\u20103. Further structural modification led to the identification of more potent inhibitors with IC50 values in the low micromolar range.

Although these viruses will express different types of matrix proteins, they all share one common motif referred as Late (l) budding domain consisting of core consensus amino acid motifs such as PPxY, YxxL, P(T/S)AP, or FPIV (where x could be any amino acid). It has been confirmed that the L domain interacts with host protein to facilitate viral egress and spread. For example, the PPxY motif within the matrix proteins of various RNA virus formed a complex with the WW domain of E3 ubiquitin ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 4 (Nedd4) for efficient virus egress.

CSGalNAcT\u20101 was shown to play a key role during the replication of HCV virus, and its expression was elevated upon HCV infection. Knockdown of CSGalNAcT\u20101 by siRNA led to significant suppression of HCV replications. It is interesting to note that 105 showed no effect on the mRNA level of CSGalNAcT\u20101, and the downregulation of CSGalNAcT\u20101 protein level was recovered by a general protease inhibitor MG132, indicating that cajanine promoted the degradation of CSGalNAcT\u20101 by proteasome pathway.

            "Throughout a drug repurposing campaign, estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) inhibitor tamoxifen (108; Figure 23) was identified as an HCV inhibitor. The known targets of 108 include ER\u03b1, P\u2010glycoprotein, calmodulin, and protein kinase C, and so forth. The inhibitors against P\u2010glycoprotein, calmodulin and protein kinase C failed to inhibit HCV",
            "FIGURE 2 3 The chemical structures of the selective estrogen receptor modulators replication, excluding the possibility of these proteins as the anti\u2010HCV targets for 108. A specific siRNA against ER\u03b1 significantly suppressed HCV RNA in replicon\u2010containing cells, and transient transfection with ER\u03b1 (but not ER\u03b2) expression plasmids also augmented HCV replications. Altogether, these results confirmed the important roles ER\u03b1 played during HCV replication. The subsequent binding assay showed that domain C of ER\u03b1 physically bound to NS5B but not NS3, NS4B, and NS5A, and such interaction is essential for the HCV genome replications. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) toremifene (109) and clomiphene (110) were also reported to inhibited several other viruses such as HIV\u20101,246 EBOV,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c247\" href=\"#r247\">247</a>] and HSV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c248\" href=\"#r248\">248</a>] However, the mechanism studies have excluded ER\u03b1 as potential antiviral targets, and the observed broad\u2010spectrum antiviral property for SERMs resulted from the inhibition of other host factors, including protein kinase C (HIV\u20101)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c249\" href=\"#r249\">249</a>] and chloride channel (HSV\u20101).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c248\" href=\"#r248\">248</a>] These host proteins together with ER\u03b1 represent promising targets for the development of novel antiviral agents to combat against drug resistance and newly emerging unknown viruses.",
            "Quite a few other host proteins or pathways have also been validated as feasible antiviral targets in vitro and even in laboratory animals, such as lipid biosynthesis and metabolism pathways,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c250\" href=\"#r250\">250</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c251\" href=\"#r251\">251</a>] PPAR\u03b1,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c252\" href=\"#r252\">252</a>] and HNF4\u03b1,253 among others.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c121\" href=\"#r121\">121</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c254\" href=\"#r254\">254</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c256\" href=\"#r256\">256</a>] Table 1 summarized the host targets included in this review along with the development stages of their respective inhibitors/modulators. It should be noted that the focus of this review is just on small\u2010molecule based HTAs, and other validated antiviral host targets with only antibody or siRNA\u2010based modulators were not included. It is reasonable to anticipate that such host proteins can also be targeted by small\u2010molecule modulators to convey antiviral activity. Notably, the antiviral host targets studied only account for a very small portion of the host factors confirmed to be essential for viral replications. In 2016, Ammari et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c257\" href=\"#r257\">257</a>] released a database for host\u2010 pathogen interactions, with which one can search the known host\u2010pathogen interactions by inputting either the genes, proteins or the viruses. It can be speculated that most of the recorded host\u2010virus interactions must play critical roles during viral replications, and thus could serve as new targets for the development of HTAs."

        "4.10 | Conclusions and perspectives": [
            "DAAs have shown great success in combating viral infections in clinic, and they are generally safe to use because they directly target viral proteins, which lack homologs in human. However, DAAs also suffer from several inherent limitations due to its viral protein targeting nature: viral proteins varied among different species and even different genotypes, and thus DAA targeting one specific viral protein is unlikely to exhibit inhibitory effect against viral proteins from other viral species or variants. Therefore, DAAs are normally narrow\u2010spectrum antiviral agents, and this is also the underlying reason for the lack of effective antiviral drugs against newly emerging viruses; the other major downside for DAAs is they are prone to cause drug resistance, particular among RNA viruses with very high frequency of replication errors. HTA agents perfectly complement to DAAs in regard to narrow\u2010spectrum activity"

            "Preclinical and drug resistance. Since host factors are probably broadly required for viral replications, HTAs are very likely to show broad\u2010spectrum antiviral profiles. HTAs also have much higher genetic barrier to resistance as compare to DAAs in that host factors are not under the genetic control of virus. The expected selected mutations are not in the host genome, and should be selected in the viral protein that interacts with the host target. Consequently, HTAs are highly expected to address the problem of drug resistance and provide solution to the treatment of newly emerging viruses.",
            "Although a large number of host factors are known to play vital roles throughout the whole life cycle of virus, only very few of them were explored as antiviral targets. This is primarily attributed to several concerns raised by HTAs. Chiefly, targeting a host protein may potentially lead to unwanted toxicity issues, because the target protein may be indispensable for some cellular functions. However, this may not be intrinsically true for all the host proteins, and many host genes are known to be nonessential for cellular functions. Therefore, the inhibition of such host proteins will be well\u2010tolerated, and the on\u2010target based toxicity can be minimized. Even though the target host protein is essential for some cellular functions, the on\u2010target based toxicity can be mitigated in many ways. First, it",
            "| 29 is known that the expression level or the activity of many cellular proteins are elevated to facilitate viral replications. Therefore, it is possible to knockdown the target protein to a level, at which the viral replication can be blocked while the normal cellular functions can still be maintained. Second, most of the time, alternative pathways or proteins exist for a cellular function, and hence the inhibition of one of these proteins or pathways may lead to the blockage of viral replication, but not the cellular function. Third, the on\u2010target based toxicity is closely associated with the duration of treatment, and the treatment of most of viral infections only lasts for several weeks or even days. Therefore, the toxicity concern raised by targeting a host factor for virus treatment can be further alleviated. It is worth noting that quite a few approved drugs targeting host factors for other indications are considered to be generally safe to use in clinic for years. Consequently, toxicity issue is something that one should pay attention to, but not something used to bias against host target antiviral agents.",
            "The other major challenge faced with the development of HTAs is that the antiviral phenotype observed with HTAs is merely in vitro artifact in some cases, and the correlation between in vitro and in vivo or clinical efficacy is very poor as in the case of development of IMPDH inhibitors as anti\u2010HCV agents. The other example is the repurposement of statins as anti\u2010HCV drugs. Statins showed very pronounced inhibitory effects against HCV replication in vitro, but yield unsatisfactory outcomes in clinic trials. The lack of reliable predictive in vitro models indeed increased the attrition rates in the development of HTAs. However, despite with these challenges, development of HTAs can be highly rewarding because HTAs can potentially address the unmet needs in the treatment of viral infections."
