            "The characteristics of human parainfluenza virus type 4 (hPIV4) infection are not thoroughly understood. We therefore clarified the characteristics of hPIV4 in Korea. Method: From January 2013 to December 2017, children admitted with respiratory tract infection at the Department of Pediatrics in Chung-Ang University Hospital were enrolled in the study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were obtained from patients and tested for hPIV types by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We retrospectively reviewed subject medical records, focusing on epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Results: Of the 12 423 NPA specimens, 8,406 were positive by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine respiratory viruses, and 1,018 were positive for one of the four types of hPIV: 1,018 specimens led to the detection of 1,029 hPIVs; 3ss (31.3%) were positive for hPIV1, 120 (11.7%) were positive for hPIV2, 356 (34.6%) were positive for hPIV3, and 231 (22.4%) were positive for hPIV4. Of the hPIV-positive patients, the mean age was 2.3 years (range, 0.1\u201312.7 years), 225 (97.4%) had no underlying disease, and 178 (77.1%) had a fever with a duration of 4.1 \u00c6 2.3 days and a peak temperature of 39.0 \u00c6 0.7 \u00b0C. The most common diagnosis in hPIV4 infection was pneumonia (44.2%), followed by bronchiolitis (26.0%) and upper respiratory tract infection (24.3%). Only 2.2% of patients were diagnosed with croup. Although the most prevalent overall type of hPIV was hPIV3, hPIV4 generally caused acute respiratory tract infection in summer and early fall in an irregular annual pattern. Conclusions: Human parainfluenza virus type 4 is an important common pathogen of respiratory tract infections in pediatric patients in Korea."

Furthermore, our center is a tertiary medical hospital, where many patients were referred with illness from a primary or secondary health care center. There might be a sampling bias that resulted in missing mild illness, such as URTI. Our pediatric department was visited by few children with immunodeficiencies, such as hemato-oncological diseases or immunodeficient diseases, so we could not explore the manifestation of hPIV4 in immunocompromised patients. Second, this study was performed retrospectively, and all data were collected from medical charts, limiting the data available for analysis. Although there are two subtypes of hPIV4 (4a and 4b), we could not distinguish between them. To overcome the limitations of the current study, further prospective nationwide multicenter studies are needed for a long period."

The authors could not determine the prevalence of hPIV4 in that study because they used the mRT-PCR panel without hPIV4.15 Studies of hPIV4 infection in Korea are thus needed to understand the clinical characteristics and epidemiology in clinical areas.",
            "During our study period, the prevalence among hPIV types was highest in hPIV3, followed by hPIV1 and hPIV4. hPIV4 was the most frequent hPIV type in 2015 and the second most common type in 2014 (Table 2). In many countries, hPIV2 is less frequently detected than hPIV1 or hPIV3.16,17 One study showed that hPIV4 was more frequently detected than hPIV2, suggesting that hPIV4 might be underestimated as a pathogen of ARTI.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] In this study, the 5-year period prevalence of hPIV2 was lower than that of hPIV4 (1.9%, 231/12 423) and was observed to be 1.0% (120/12 423), which was the lowest detection rate among hPIV types. hPIV4 infection accounted for 22.4% (231/1,029) of total hPIV infections in the current study. This value shows that hPIV4 is more common than is believed.",
            "Depending on the age group, the prevalence of hPIV types showed significant differences. As patients aged, hPIV2",
            "* indicates statistically significant values (P < 0.05). \u2020Single infection group (S). \u2021Coinfection group, (C). \u00a7P value (P). \u00b6Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).",
            "became increasingly prevalent but the prevalence of hPIV3 decreased. We thought that tendency of each age group in hPIV2 and hPIV3 was influenced by the proportion of diagnosis (P = 0.000). hPIV2 was more prevalent in URTI, and hPIV3 was more prevalent in LRTI.",
            "We found some characteristics of hPIV4 infection. Few children infected with hPIV4 developed croup in our study, as shown in previous studies.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] In the single-infection group with hPIV4, more children had wheezing and were diagnosed with bronchiolitis. Most hPIV4 infections manifested as LRTIs. The coinfection rate was also highest in hPIV4, as shown in a previous study.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]",
            "In the present study, the most frequently coinfecting virus was rhinovirus, followed by enterovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus. Rhinoviruses occur year round except in winter.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] Rhinovirus is also frequently co-detected by mRT-PCR,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] as is bocavirus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] Furthermore, enterovirus occurs from summer to early fall, and adenovirus occurs from late summer to fall; these seasons overlap with hPIV4, according to the KINRESS project. We therefore believe that this overlap is the reason that these viruses were frequently co-detected with hPIV4 in this study.",
            "There are few studies on the epidemiology and characteristics of hPIV4 worldwide. As hPIV4 is considered a marginal respiratory pathogen, it is excluded from many commercial respiratory mRT-PCR panel kits, so many clinicians do not understand its features and have overlooked its clinical importance. Thus, a strength of our study was that it included only Korean data, which was from a 5-year period with a large group of enrolled children.",
            "However, this study also had some limitations. First, this study was performed in a single center for 5 years and thus does not reflect the general data from Korea. Furthermore, our center is a tertiary medical hospital, where many patients were referred with illness from a primary or secondary health care center. There might be a sampling bias that resulted in missing mild illness, such as URTI. Our pediatric department was visited by few children with immunodeficiencies, such as hemato-oncological diseases or immunodeficient diseases, so we could not explore the manifestation of hPIV4 in immunocompromised patients. Second, this study was performed retrospectively, and all data were collected from medical charts, limiting the data available for analysis. Although there are two subtypes of hPIV4 (4a and 4b), we could not distinguish between them. To overcome the limitations of the current study, further prospective nationwide multicenter studies are needed for a long period.",
            "In conclusion, hPIV4 is an important pathogen of respiratory tract infections in children. hPIV4 was found to be more common than previously thought and manifested with severe illnesses such as LRTIs, especially bronchiolitis, in summer and early fall in an irregular annual pattern. We should therefore realize the impact of hPIV4 and the need to detect it in children with respiratory tract symptoms.",
