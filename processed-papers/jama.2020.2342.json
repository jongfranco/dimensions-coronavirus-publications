In a large outbreak, additional limitations to providing ECMO may include a lack of ECMO consoles or disposable equipment, suitably trained staff, or isolation rooms with the requisite infrastructure.

            "A number of different models of ECMO service provision exist worldwide, ranging from a relative lack of regulation and centralization\u2014with many hospitals having ECMO capability but often with very low case volumes (eg, in the US or Japan)\u2014through to regional or national coordination of ECMO referral centers with dedicated interhospital retrieval teams (eg, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Qatar, the United Kingdom, or Sweden). In response to influenza A(H1N1) in 2009, some countries such as Italy adopted the latter model and it is possible that COVID-19 could be addressed similarly. The advantages of such an approach include standardization of indications, management, data collection, and containment.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] The disadvantage is the potential for hospitals that provide ECMO to be overwhelmed with critically ill patients unless interhospital transfers are centrally coordinated.",
            "With the WHO recommendation for ECMO in place and the tropism of the COVID-19 virus for severe respiratory illness, the number of cases in which ECMO is used may increase over the course of this outbreak. However, there may come a tipping point. Should the case volume in any given region increase beyond the ability to provide routine care, any earlier increase in ECMO use may give way, with utilization later decreasing in proportion to the overwhelming demands on the system as a whole.",
            "Support with ECMO is for the most critically ill patients in regions with the extensive resources required to provide this therapy. ECMO is not a therapy to be rushed to the frontline when all resources are stretched in a pandemic. In less well-resourced countries, many more lives will be saved by ensuring oxygen and pulse oximetry are widely available. Mitigation efforts to slow the outbreak are critical so that health care systems are not overwhelmed and all patients receive the correct management, whether simply confirmation of the diagnosis and appropriate quarantine, oxygen therapy alone, mechanical ventilation or, for those most likely to benefit, ECMO."

            "To tients with refractory hypoxemia to expert centers postulate about the potential benefit of ECMO in this capable of providing extracorporeal membrane oxygen- infection, more data on the mechanism of death and ation (ECMO).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] disease are required."
        ],
        "Results": [
            "ECMO is a resource-intensive, highly ber of cases outside of China remains small, will likely specialized, and expensive form of life support with the occur via many dispersed epicenters where local transmission has become established.",
            "The role of ECMO in the management of COVID-19 of this virus and the relatively high numbers of is unclear at this point.",
            "It has been used in some pa- patients who require intensive care, this may prove tients with COVID-19 in China but detailed information very resource-consumptive.",

            "If the mechanism of death in COVID-19 ultifluenza A(H1N1) in 2009, when it was initially unclear mately includes a substantial number of patients with what the role of ECMO should be.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] the de- septic shock or refractory multiorgan failure, the gree of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 is much shift away from ECMO is likely to occur earlier because jama.com (Reprinted) JAMA Published online February 19, 2020",
            "The advantages of such an approach include standardization of indications, management, data collection, and containment.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] The disadvantage is the potential for hospitals that provide ECMO to be overwhelmed with critically ill patients unless interhospital transfers are centrally coordinated.",
            "With the WHO recommendation for ECMO in place and the tropism of the COVID-19 virus for severe respiratory illness, the number of cases in which ECMO is used may increase over the course of this outbreak.",
            "Should the case volume in any given region increase beyond the ability to provide routine care, any earlier increase in ECMO use may give way, with utilization later decreasing in proportion to the overwhelming demands on the system as a whole."
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Support with ECMO is for the most critically ill patients in regions with the extensive resources required to provide this therapy.",
            "Mitigation efforts to slow the outbreak are critical so that health care systems are not overwhelmed and all patients receive the correct management, whether confirmation of the diagnosis and appropriate quarantine, oxygen therapy alone, mechanical ventilation or, for those most likely to benefit, ECMO."
