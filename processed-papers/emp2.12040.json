        "abstract": "On December 31, 2019, the Chinese government announced an outbreak of a novel coronavirus, recently named COVID-19. During the following weeks the international medical community has witnessed with unprecedented coverage the public health response both domestically by the Chinese government, and on an international scale as cases have spread to dozens of countries. While much regarding the virus and the Chinese public health response is still unknown, national and public health institutions globally are preparing for a pandemic. As cases and spread of the virus grow, emergency and other front-line providers may become more anxious about the possibility of encountering a potential case. This review describes the tenets of a public health response to an infectious outbreak by using recent historical examples and also by characterizing what is known about the ongoing response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The intent of the review is to empower the practitioner to monitor and evaluate the local, national and global public health response to an emerging infectious disease.",

The situation is dynamic with cases identified nearly hourly. The stakes are high, as the CFR and morbidity of the virus appears to be higher than influenza. The extent of media coverage regarding this outbreak means that the management of any cases identified outside of China will be heavily scrutinized both regarding disease-related outcomes and the adherence to public health guidelines for protection of the larger population. It is imperative that providers are familiar with the public health considerations of encountering a person under investigation or confirmed case. To this end, providers should take care to consume accurate and timely information to inform their respective institution\u2019s triage and treatment practices.

While progression to a pandemic may not be inevitable, emergency and other front-line medical providers have an obligation to stand in readiness."

            "the initial local and national reactions to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus outbreak. The apparent index case starting the SARS epidemic was reported in Guangdong Province, a coastal province in South China, in November 2002. After a local government official became ill, then succumbed to the infection, several other cases were reported in surrounding cities.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]",
            "In mid-December 2002, local health authorities took notice, followed by rapid notification of the provincial government and the national Ministry of Health by January 2003. Initial investigative reports of the outbreak were marked \u201ctop secret\u201d and could only be opened by high-ranking officials. No public notifications had been made at this point and no mention was made of the outbreak in the news media until at least February 2003. This \u201cfatal period of hesitation\u201d led to wide-spread speculation and fear among the local population and rumors of a \u201cdeadly flu\u201d began to spread, undermining public trust in the government\u2019s response. Even following initial news conferences describing the outbreak, government officials continued to minimize the risks of the outbreak. Not until April 2003 did the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issue a nationwide bulletin on preventing spread of the illness, by which time outbreaks had already occurred in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Toronto, Canada, among others.",
            "Once mobilized, the Chinese public health machine was able to quickly control and ultimately eliminate the outbreak within a year.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] It remains unclear how much damage could have been avoided had the Chinese government been able and willing to communicate accurate outbreak data in a transparent and timely manner. One of the most striking features of the current COVID-19 outbreak are the reports of detainment of journalists, threats to whistleblowers, punishment of government officials, and deletion of social media posts in apparent efforts to control the image of the outbreak. This has contributed to a widespread distrust of the communications by the Chinese government and public health officials reminiscent of the SARS epidemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]",
            "As illustrated by the SARS epidemic, outbreaks have impacts beyond the immediate effects of case fatality. They set into motion broader and indirect health consequences, short- and long-term economic impacts, and social disturbances which are far-reaching and predictable."
        ],
        "2.2.1 The impact on health care": [
            "During the initial period of outbreak, health care resources are often diverted away from providing routine care and shifted to outbreak management. During the 2014\u20132015 Ebola crisis in West Africa, the health care systems of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea resulted in a reduction in the ability to provide routine care for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] One author estimated this reduction in services cost >10,600 additional lives, rivaling the total death toll due to Ebola of the 3 countries combined.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Although some of this increased mortality is likely due to the limitations of health care in that region, an issue not shared by China, developed nations are also at risk for indirect increases in mortality. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, USbased emergency departments saw surges in visits. Despite a lack of increased admissions, study hospitals still experienced statistically a higher number of inpatient deaths attributable to stroke and myocardial infarction.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]"
        ],
        "2.2.2 The economic impact": [
            "The SARS outbreak ultimately led to >700 deaths, affected 37 countries and resulted in an estimated cost to the world economy of US$40 billion.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] While the full extent of its impact remains to be seen, the COVID-19 will have short term financial impacts primarily derived from the cost of sentinel case identification and containment. Additional personnel hours are needed to isolate infectious cases and implement effective case tracing. Bedside care of these cases expends disposable medical dollars (medications, single-use personal protective equipment and care delivery items). Yet these direct costs pale in comparison to indirect economic expenditures. In 2015, the World Bank estimated that the 3 Ebola epicenter countries experienced a loss of >US$1.6 billion which reflected 12% of their gross domestic product (GDP). Low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have decreased ability to maintain tax revenue streams during stalled economic activity and government implemented curfews and quarantines, although it is yet unclear if this will apply to a high-income country like China.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Neighboring LMICs to an epidemic will likely experience economic stunting. Despite not having a single confirmed case of Ebola, The Gambia reported a 65% reduction in hotel bookings and a cancelation of 50% of inbound planes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] However, high income countries are not totally immune to fiscal shocks during outbreaks. Despite hospitalizing only 186 people, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus cost the Republic of Korea >US$2.6 billion in lost tourism wages.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Economic fallout will likely be tangible worldwide, as 2018 data indicates China has the world\u2019s second largest economy, with a GDP of >US$13.6 trillion, 16% of the global economy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]"

        "2.2.3 The societal impact": [
            "There is a large penumbra of social capital at risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. Public health emergencies splash constantly across news headlines and social media platforms. In a positive sense, researchers have demonstrated the ability to harness this open source information and created an entire field called \u201cdigital epidemiology.\u201d Twitter data has been used to track surveillance for outbreaks and responses to interventions.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Alternatively, misinformation, perceived versus actual risk and fear-based communication strategies can become normative. The recent Zika emergency revealed that repetitive exposures to media messages can demonstrably augment fear.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] This fear may lead to palpable changes in behavior patterns. Retrospective analysis",
            "of prior outbreaks shows both over- and under-reaction to health information. In response to alarm-based messaging the populace has both mass-exited and not complied with quarantines, burdened and underutilized health systems, and ignored and demanded extraordinary precautionary measures. Locations and people groups that are low risk for being threats experience fallout and social ostracism.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] The COVID-19 has followed suit with accounts of uninformed acts of racism against French Asians, detainments of 6000 cruise ship passengers, airline route suspensions, and country border closures.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] On February 2nd, the WHO released a situation report stating they are in a fight against an \u201cinfodemic\u201d (overabundance of information of varying accuracy) and will utilize multiple media platforms to inform the public.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]"

            "With a large number of stakeholders and the WHO functioning as more of a network and data conduit, a certain amount of decentralization is inevitable.

Outcomes improve when countries have a pandemic plan and move quickly to establish protocols that limit the spread of an outbreak.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] These include establishing case definitions, designating persons under investigation (PUI), pursuit of diagnostic tests, continuing incidence surveillance, and characterization of morbidity and case fatality rate (CFR).

        "3.2.2 Containing an outbreak": [
            "Containment of past outbreaks such as SARS and Ebola has relied on the traditional public health strategies of evaluation of persons under investigation (those suspected but not confirmed of having the disease), exposure mapping or contact tracing, isolating and treating affected patients, and potentially quarantining those exposed but not symptomatic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>] The unusually long incubation period (median 5.2 days, IQR 4.1\u20137, with 95th percentile at 12.5 days) has led to the WHO and CDC recommendation to quarantine certain individuals exposed to asymptomatic persons with potential COVID-19 for up to 14 days after exposure.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>] The recommendations have informed the decisions by multiple NPHIs to quarantine returned travelers in government facilities and to quarantine cruise ship passengers onboard multiple vessels.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]",

Significant progress was made in the rapid development of an efficacious Ebola virus vaccine, leading to the creation of a research and development blueprint that will theoretically improve research and development of new vaccines to emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.40,42 While research is ongoing for effective antiviral medications, public health entities may also pursue compassionate use of existing antiviral medications. Examples of this include the use of remdesivir in the United States and lopinavir/ritonavir in Asia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>] See Table 3 for further discussion of public health interventions."

The COVID-19 has demonstrated the challenges and successes when applying these public health principles to an ongoing crisis."

        "4.1 Challenges in the COVID-19 public health response": [
            "Shortcomings often emerge in the first few weeks of an outbreak and have emerged in COVID-19 pandemic.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>] Incomplete or poorly communicated preliminary data may hamper the national and international response. For example, the relatively low CFR rate (\u223c2% compared to >60% in Ebola Virus cases, >30% in MERS-CoV cases, and >9%",
            "in SARS-CoV cases) raises concerns for subclinical and unreported infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>] This restricts public health officials\u2019 ability to determine whether this ongoing Chinese epidemic (widespread disease transmission within a nation) has yet made the jump to a pandemic (widespread disease transmission occurring in multiple nations). Similarly, the competence of the Chinese CDC in identifying the outbreak and implementing rapid control measures is threatened by reports of \u201cnarrative controlling\u201d preventing effective communication between frontline practitioners and the global outbreak response.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>] In an outbreak that seems to change hourly, a delay of days or weeks diminishes the responders\u2019 ability to truly assess the impact, transmissibility, extent of spread, and virulence of the disease. As such, much of the characterizations of COVID-19 should be understood as preliminary and subject to change as data becomes more readily available.",
            "These persistent knowledge gaps regarding the outbreak remain concerning. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) rapid risk assessment publication on January 22, 2020 points out that \u201cin the absence of detailed information from the ongoing outbreak investigations in China, it is not possible to quantify the extent of human-to-human transmission.\u201d A similar concern exists regarding the Chinese algorithm for testing, case definitions, means of identifying PUIs, or surveillance of contacts.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>] Without this information it remains difficult for NPHIs to determine specific risk of transmission, quantify virulence, or estimate CFR with any certainty. Some of the more extreme policies enacted by individual governments may stem from this deficit in effective communication and transparency.",
            "In addition to a lack of transparency, some experts have also called into question the specific measures employed by the Chinese government. A recent review of the efficacy of travel checkpoint temperature screening during the Ebola Virus and SARS outbreaks revealed that no cases were identified by these measures.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>] The complete lockdown of the city of Wuhan is an unprecedented intervention, and its efficacy will be of great interest to the public health community."

        "4.2 Successes in the COVID-19 public health response": [
            "There are some improvements in the Chinese response to the crisis as compared to prior public health events. In contrast to the decisions made by Chinese health authorities and government officials during the 2003 SARS outbreak, the existence of the initial patient cluster was rapidly reported to the WHO China Office in December 2019, with a novel coronavirus being identified by early January 2020. The speed of cluster identification and pathogen isolation is likely due to additional investment in public health resources and infrastructure by China\u2019s CDC.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] The Chinese government has demonstrated commitment to controlling spread of the virus, including closure of the seafood market in Wuhan, cessation of public transport, screening at travel checkpoints, travel restrictions, closure of cultural landmarks and businesses, and cancellation of the Lunar New Year celebrations.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>] Media sources and inhabitants of Wuhan have described the situation as \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d in a city of >11 million people, representing an \u201cunprecedented public health intervention.\u201d[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>]"
        ],
        "5 CONCLUSION": [
            "As hospital systems and emergency departments monitor and prepare for the COVID-19 outbreak, there are still many unanswered questions. The situation is dynamic with cases identified nearly hourly. The stakes are high, as the CFR and morbidity of the virus appears to be higher than influenza. The extent of media coverage regarding this outbreak means that the management of any cases identified outside of China will be heavily scrutinized both regarding disease-related outcomes and the adherence to public health guidelines for protection of the larger population. It is imperative that providers are familiar with the public health considerations of encountering a person under investigation or confirmed case. To this end, providers should take care to consume accurate and timely information to inform their respective institution\u2019s triage and treatment practices. For links to updated guidelines please see Appendix A. While progression to a pandemic may not be inevitable, emergency and other front-line medical providers have an obligation to stand in readiness.",
