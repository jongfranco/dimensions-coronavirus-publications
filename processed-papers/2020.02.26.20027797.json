        "abstract": "In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID\u201519, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack-McKendrick model. The first relation is 1/\u03c4grow=1/\u03c4trans\u22121/\u03c4inf, where \u03c4grow is the time constant of the exponential growth of an epidemic, \u03c4trans is the time for a pathogen to be transmitted from one patient to uninfected person, and the infectious time \u03c4inf is the time during which the pathogen keeps its power of transmission. The second relation p(\u221e) \u22481\u2212exp(\u2212(R0\u22121)/0.60) is the relation between p(\u221e), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society,and the basic reproduction number, R0, which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time. The third relation 1/\u03c4end=1/\u03c4inf\u2212(1\u2212p(\u221e))/\u03c4trans gives the decay time constant \u03c4end at the ending stage of the epidemic. Derived relations are applied to influenza in Japan in 2019 for characterizing the epidemic.",

S0 = S(t) + I(t) + R(t). When the transmission power of the disease is set as \u03b2 and the recovery rate from the infection is \u03b3, the epidemic of the disease is given by the following three differential equations.",

Figure 3 shows the influenza epidemic in Japan over the past decade (ref.[5]). We choose influenza in 2019, which is referred as JpnInf2019 in this paper. In ref.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], we fitted a Gaussian to JpnInf2019. As shown by the red solid curve in Fig. 4, the model described above reproduces",
            "JpnInf2019 better than a simple Gaussian. The parameters were \u03c4tran s= 0.52 weeks and \u03c4inf = 1 week. From the values of \u03c4trans and \u03c4inf for fitting, the reproduction number R0 = 1.92 and the final size",
            "FIG4: Reproducing JpnInf2019 by the model with \u03c4trans= 0.52 weeks and \u03c4inf = 1 week.",
            "estimated by Eq (18) is p(\u221e) = 0.77. Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of the Japanese government reported that the estimated number of patients who consulted doctors was about 12,000, 000 over the country (ref. 6). This estimated value was only 10 % of the population of Japan and far smaller than p(\u221e) = 77 %. There are three possibilities for the reason. The first is that most patients did not go to a hospital and the real number of patients was 92,400, 000. The second is that only 1/8 of the area in Japan was the reach of the pathogen. The third is a combination of the first and the second reasons. Thus, we realize the evaluation of the final size p(\u221e) is difficult.",
            "While reproduction of the epidemic by the model is fairly good near the peak of the epidemic, but at the far skirt, deviation of the data from the model is not negligible as seen in Fig.[5] which shows a log plot of Fig.[4].In the model fitting, the time constant was 1.15 weeks at the rising and the decay time constant was 1,7 weeks. Hence, \u03c4grow calculated by Eq (7) was 1.1 weeks. But in JpnInf2019, the reported number of patients increased exponentially with a time constant of 1.5 weeks and decreased exponentially at the ending stage with a time constant of 2.5 weeks. By increasing \u03c4trans to 0.61 weeks",
            "from 0.52 weeks, the time constant of the rising of the epidemic can be increased to 1.5 weeks in the model calculation, but the width of the epidemic in the model calculation was too wider than the real one as shown in Fig.[6].",
            "In all the cases of the epidemic, there should be a difference between the reported number of patients and the real number of infected people. Not all infected people will go to a hospital and not all patients are not inspected by medical institutes. In analyzing statistics, we assume the ratio of the reported number to the real number is constant during the epidemic, but often the assumption can be wrong. We expect the ratio is smaller in the beginning and at the ending of an epidemic. Then, the time constant of the \u201capparent rise\u201d and \u201capparent ending\u201d will be shorter than the real ones. However, this expectation was the opposite in Fig.[5].",
            "The slower increase and the slower decrease at the skirt of the epidemic could suggest the transmission power \u03b2 of the virus may change in time, which, we think, is not plausible. At present, we do not know the reason why the simple Kermack\u2013McKendrick cannot reproduce the whole epidemic including the skirt parts. Thus, from the analysis of JpnInf2019 by the model described above, we learn that it is important to remember that the time constant of the \u201capparent\u201d increase of the epidemic in the early stage does not re-produce the whole epidemic.",
            "The above information helps greatly to understand the to-be-planned analysis of COVID\u201519.",
