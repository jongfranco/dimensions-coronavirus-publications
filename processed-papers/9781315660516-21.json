Compared to the other OECD member countries, Korea has had a relatively healthy fiscal condition in that it has had a fiscal surplus for quite a long period of time until recently. However, it is possible that the fiscal health of Korea will deteriorate in the future. Challenges may come from multiple factors such as the aging population, sluggish economic growth, declining revenue, expenditure growth (especially social spending), and debt accumulation. All of these factors may undermine the fiscal sustainability of Korea, requiring the fiscal authorities of Korea to make preemptive efforts to overcome the possible challenges.",
