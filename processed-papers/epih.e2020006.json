            "Several clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China were reported to the Chinese health authorities starting on December 8, 2019, and most of these cases were epidemiologically linked to a local fish and animal market [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The pathogenic agent responsible for these clusters of pneumonia was identified as a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].

            "The estimated reproductive number of 0.3 was obtained from a small number of infected persons with imperfect information in the very early stages of the outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]; therefore the reproductive number of 2019-nCoV is likely to be similar to that of the 2002/2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus during the pre-intervention period (range, 2 to 3) and that of the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus in the United States (range, 1.3 to 1.7) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>].

Furthermore, it is longer than that of the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus (median incubation period, 1.4 days; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.8) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Therefore, the evidence reviewed above shows that the current control measures for 2019-nCoV, including a quarantine and observation period of 14 days for suspected cases, can be considered appropriate [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The generation time and serial interval of 2019nCoV are longer than those of the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus (median generation time, 2.7 days; 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.5; and mean serial interval: range, 2.6 to 3.2) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. However, the mean serial interval of 2019-nCoV is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus (mean, 8.4 days; standard deviation, 3.8) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. The overall case fatality rate of 2019-nCoV was estimated by international experts to range from 3% to 14% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], and it is more likely to cause infection in older age groups with commodities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>].",
