The symptoms of COVID-19 included fever, cough, shortness of breath, and occasionally watery diarrhea (2). As of February 3rd, 2020 (8:00 PM, GMT+8), 17,238 cases of COVID-19 infections and 361 deaths have been confirmed in mainland China (3).<br/><br/>In the 21st century, two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused global epidemics with more than 10,000 cumulative cases in the past two decades (4,5). Of significant concern is the pandemic potential of the virus, as well as its transmission dynamics. The basic reproduction number (R0) and best estimates of case-fatality rates (CFR) are two key parameters to understand the basic epidemiological features of the outbreak (6). Although several studies have been done to estimate the basic reproduction number in the early phase of this outbreak, there is still lack of reliable estimates of CFR for COVID-19 to date (7-9). The global epidemic of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak was reported to have an estimated CFR of 9.6% globally and a considerably lower CFR of 6.4% in mainland China, while the MERS outbreak was estimated to have a much higher CFR of 34.5% worldwide and 37.1% in Saudi Arabia (10-13). Therefore, it is of great significance for clinicians and public health practitioners to implement efficient and effective disease control interventions."

            "<strong>Discussion and Conclusions</strong><br/><br/>In the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, the detection rate of mild patients was low in Wuhan, only patients with serious conditions could be confirmed due to hospitalization. Therefore, the case fatality rate (CFR) has been increasing over time, resulting in a high overall estimate of 5.25% (95% CI: 4.98\u20135.51%). Subsequently, a large number of new cases were detected from January 27 onwards due to the improved the efficiency of detection in Wuhan. Thereafter the CFR has gradually decreased, but it is still the highest in the country, indicating that the pressure of epidemic prevention and control and clinical treatment in Wuhan are still very high.<br/><br/>The Hubei province (except Wuhan) has an estimated CFR of 1.41% (95% CI: 1.38\u20131.45%). Based on our estimate of the confidence interval, the CFR in this cluster will be less than 1.5%. We predict that the CFR level in Hubei province (except Wuhan) will be maintained in the near future if there are no major changes in detection methods, healthcare resources, clinical treatment, and other factors. The cluster of mainland China (except Hubei province) still has a decreasing trend in CFR with an estimate of 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12\u20130.18%), clearly lower than Hubei. Since the epidemic situation in Wuhan has been further aggravated, the Chinese Government has implemented metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and several nearby cities from January 23, 2020 (15). Considering the initial spread of the epidemic outside Hubei province, the state and local governments at all levels have paid enough attention and adopted strong control measures. Numerous domestic airports and train stations have adopted temperature screening measures to detect passengers with fever. Individuals from Hubei province will be quarantined and further observed. Thus, the estimated CFR in regions other than Hubei province, where efficient detection and timely treatment can be guaranteed by sufficient healthcare resources, is more likely to be closer to the true value of clinical treatment prognosis estimates of COVID-19. Our estimate of CFR for whole mainland China, which is 2.10% (95% CI: 2.05\u20132.14%), is consistent with the tentative estimate of 2% for CFR in a preliminary estimation (16)."

Second, our study is a statistical analysis of the data explaining the early epidemic of COVID-19, with only limited ability to predict what the CFR will finally be. Considering the ongoing national and global outbreaks of COVID-19, the CFR of the outbreak could change at the later stage. It is challenging but worth trying to estimate the CFR in the early phase to provide information for successful control on the COVID-19."

            "In this study, we provide a purely data-driven statistical method to estimate the CFR in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Compared to dynamic transmission models, our model is simple and does not require complex parameter assumptions. The model fitting efficiency is high and the estimation of confidence interval is accurate in the early phase of the outbreak. Similar model was previously implemented to give future population projections and we employed it for the first time to estimate CFR (17). To our knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive estimation for the CFR of the COVID-19 jointly completed by a multidisciplinary team, including respiratory physicians, statisticians, epidemiologists, and evidence-based medicine experts. Our findings could be used to inform guideline development, systematic review and knowledge translation programs (18-20).",
