        "abstract": "The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected thousands of people with a large number of deaths across 26 countries. The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development.",

            "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious health threat for the whole society, thus there is an urgent need for drugs and preventative measures. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by lung infections with symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Based on the information from CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the symptoms can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure to the virus which can transmit from human to human or from contact with infected surfaces and objects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. It is critical to rapidly identify immune epitopes. The S protein is of crucial in the fuse and entry of virus into host cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], therefore it is a primary target for neutralizing antibodies. The specificity of epitopebased vaccines can be enhanced by selecting parts of S protein exposed on the surface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Medical biotechnology is important in developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, computer-based immune-informatics can improve time and economic effectiveness, as a result, it is also an essential method in immunogenic analysis and vaccine development. In this study, we characterized the physio-chemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome for epitope candidates and adopted an immune-informatics based pipeline with highly stringent criteria to identify S protein targeted B- and T-cell epitopes that may potentially promote an immune response in the host. The antigenicity, flexibility, solvent accessibility, disulphide bonds of predicted epitopes were evaluated, yielding four potential B-cell epitope and vaccine candidate. Allergenicity and toxicity analysis confirmed the four B-cell epitopes are of non-allergen and non-toxin. Stability analysis revealed that they can not be digested by multiple enzymes. In addition, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding Tcell epitopes were predicted to interact with numerous HLA alleles and to be highly antigenic in nature. Allergenicity, toxicity, and physiochemical properties of T-cell epitopes were analyzed to increase specificity and selectivity. The stability and safety were confirmed by digestion analysis. All selected Band T- cell (MHC class-I and II) epitopes were conserved in all isolates of different locations globally without mutations observed yet. We predict the B- and T-cell epitopes identified here may assist the development of potent peptide-based vaccines to address the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. But the replication of SARS-CoV-2 must be error-prone, which is similar to SARS-CoV with reported mutation rate of 4x10-4 substitutions/site/year [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Antiviral vaccines are necessary to be developed before the predicted epitopes are potentially obsolete. In addition, our immune-informatics based pipeline also provides a framework to identify B- and T- cell epitopes having therapeutic potential with excellent scope for SARS-CoV-2, but not limited to specific virus."

The result demonstrates that all of B-cell epitopes were predicted to be non-toxin (Table 2a).

        "Discussion": [
            "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious health threat for the whole society, thus there is an urgent need for drugs and preventative measures. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by lung infections with symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Based on the information from CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the symptoms can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure to the virus which can transmit from human to human or from contact with infected surfaces and objects [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. It is critical to rapidly identify immune epitopes. The S protein is of crucial in the fuse and entry of virus into host cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], therefore it is a primary target for neutralizing antibodies. The specificity of epitopebased vaccines can be enhanced by selecting parts of S protein exposed on the surface [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Medical biotechnology is important in developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, computer-based immune-informatics can improve time and economic effectiveness, as a result, it is also an essential method in immunogenic analysis and vaccine development. In this study, we characterized the physio-chemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome for epitope candidates and adopted an immune-informatics based pipeline with highly stringent criteria to identify S protein targeted B- and T-cell epitopes that may potentially promote an immune response in the host. The antigenicity, flexibility, solvent accessibility, disulphide bonds of predicted epitopes were evaluated, yielding four potential B-cell epitope and vaccine candidate. Allergenicity and toxicity analysis confirmed the four B-cell epitopes are of non-allergen and non-toxin. Stability analysis revealed that they can not be digested by multiple enzymes. In addition, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding Tcell epitopes were predicted to interact with numerous HLA alleles and to be highly antigenic in nature. Allergenicity, toxicity, and physiochemical properties of T-cell epitopes were analyzed to increase specificity and selectivity. The stability and safety were confirmed by digestion analysis. All selected Band T- cell (MHC class-I and II) epitopes were conserved in all isolates of different locations globally without mutations observed yet. We predict the B- and T-cell epitopes identified here may assist the development of potent peptide-based vaccines to address the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. But the replication of SARS-CoV-2 must be error-prone, which is similar to SARS-CoV with reported mutation rate of 4x10-4 substitutions/site/year [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Antiviral vaccines are necessary to be developed before the predicted epitopes are potentially obsolete. In addition, our immune-informatics based pipeline also provides a framework to identify B- and T- cell epitopes having therapeutic potential with excellent scope for SARS-CoV-2, but not limited to specific virus.",
