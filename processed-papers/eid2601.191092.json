            "Syphilis produces myriad nonspecific signs and symptoms. For example, optic disk swelling might be seen in patients with syphilis as a result of cranial hypertension (papilloedema), inflammatory optic neuritis with papillitis, or optic perineuritis. We report a case involving differential diagnosis of syphilitic bilateral papillitis mimicking papilloedema.",
            "Syphilis, caused by infection with the bacterium Treponema pallidum, is a sexually transmitted infection for which incidence has been increasing since 2002, especially among adult men >55 years of age who engage in risky sex [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Syphilis has earned its nickname, the \u201cgreat masquerader,\u201d because it produces myriad nonspecific signs and symptoms that make it difficult to distinguish from certain other diseases. Eye impairment occurs in >3% of cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] and can be the first manifestation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Optic nerve involvement, either unilateral or bilateral, in the form of papilloedema, perineuritis, or optic neuritis, is the second most common type of syphilitic ocular impairment [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Each of these conditions shares findings from fundoscopy testing with unilateral or bilateral optic disk swelling (Table), but the etiology and, therefore, the diagnostic algorithm are different. Semiology and ophthalmological findings are the key to achieving a correct syndromic diagnosis.",
            "We describe the case of a 62-year-old man who was admitted to the neurology department at Hospital Universitario de la Princesa in Madrid, Spain, with a 4-day history of bilateral decreased visual acuity. He was obese, an active smoker, and dyslipidemic. He reported neither ocular pain nor dyschromatopsia suggestive of optic neuritis, nor headache or diplopia usually associated with intracranial hypertension. He had no known history of syphilis. Visual acuity was 20/32 in the right eye and 20/63 in the left. Pupils were equal and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect, which is typical of unilateral optic neuritis. Slit lamp examination results were normal, showing no inflamed cells in the anterior chambers or vitreous. Neurologic examination was normal. Opening pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on lumbar puncture was 27 cm H2O, above the reference range of 5\u201320 cm H2O. The CSF white cell count was 0, with normal glucose and protein levels. A fundus examination revealed bilateral optic disk swelling and peripapillary retinitis; visual field testing revealed bilateral central scotoma and an enlarged blind spot (Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc. gov/EID/article/26/1/19-1122-App1.pdf).",

Syphilis has earned its nickname, the \u201cgreat masquerader,\u201d because it produces myriad nonspecific signs and symptoms that make it difficult to distinguish from certain other diseases. Eye impairment occurs in >3% of cases (2,3) and can be the first manifestation (4). Optic nerve involvement, either unilateral or bilateral, in the form of papilloedema, perineuritis, or optic neuritis, is the second most common type of syphilitic ocular impairment (5). Each of these conditions shares findings from fundoscopy testing with unilateral or bilateral optic disk swelling (Table), but the etiology and, therefore, the diagnostic algorithm are different. Semiology and ophthalmological findings are the key to achieving a correct syndromic diagnosis.",
