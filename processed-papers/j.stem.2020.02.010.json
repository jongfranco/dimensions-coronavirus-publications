            "From a stem cell biology standpoint, the lung\u2019s response to epithelial injury appears to be context dependent. While there exist examples in the literature that support the notion that epithelial injury triggers de-differentiation of mature cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTata_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rTata_et+al_2013_a\">Tata et al, 2013</a>), this work from <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKathiriya_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rKathiriya_et+al_2020_a\">Kathiriya et al (2020</a>) supports the notion that lung repair is modulated by expansion of prespecified or committed progenitors. However, until we have the tools to rigorously lineage-trace, deplete, and/or genetically modify this H2-K1high cell population at specific times in the context of different levels of injury, we will not have definitive proof that they are permanently programmed to their fate or proof of whether there is natural cycling of Scgb1a1+ airway cells to adopt this H2-K1high identity and function.",
            "In the context of lung regenerative medicine, this work from <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKathiriya_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rKathiriya_et+al_2020_a\">Kathiriya et al (2020</a>) raises two very interesting points. First, the authors suggest these H2K1high cells have enhanced susceptibility to direct viral infection, perhaps explaining the abnormal alveolar epithelial repair following severe injury from influenza (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cVaughan_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rVaughan_et+al_2015_a\">Vaughan et al, 2015</a>). Depletion of this highly regenerative cellular subset with concomitant alveolar injury could potentially contribute to the development and pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with infection with viruses with significant distal lung epithelial tropism, such as influenza and potentially the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).",
            "The second interesting point is the finding that the H2-K1high cells begin to express markers of senescence following robust activation. This suggests that the H2-K1high population has limited expansion and repair capacity in the long term. This could perhaps explain why some individuals develop non-resolving ARDS and why others develop chronic abnormal alveolar remodeling (as in fibrosis). As the authors suggest, the opportunity to transplant \u2018\u2018fresh\u2019\u2019 H2-K1high cells (assuming a human correlate is identified) into patients\u2019 lungs at times of depletion could represent a novel therapeutic strategy. To move in this direction, there is a clear need to look for and study correlates of the H2-K1high population in human lung. Our field is only beginning to recognize epithelial stem cell subsets in human lung, and to date, it has been difficult to identify direct correlates of distinct murine lung stem cell subsets in human tissue.",
            "This is an exciting time in lung stem cell biology. As our understanding of epithelial stem cell populations and dynamics increases, so too will our ability to harness lung stem cells for regenerative medicine. This paper marks yet another step along this journey."
