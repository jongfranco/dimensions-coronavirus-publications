        "abstract": "Coronaviruses are the well-known cause of severe respiratory, enteric and systemic infections in a wide range of hosts including man, mammals, fish, and avian. The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). This decade\u2019s first CoV, named 2019-nCoV, emerged from Wuhan, China, and declared as \u2018Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u2019 on January 30th, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.",

            "<strong>Conclusion and future prospects</strong><br/><br/>The nCoV is the most recently emerging virus after the past episodes and panics haunted by Ebola, Zika and Nipah viruses, as well as earlier emergencies posed by Bird flu and Swine flu viruses. The emerging novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has become a global concern within a short span of time. Since its origin from Wuhan, Hubei province of China in the first week of December 2019, it has claimed 425 lives in China and infected 20630 in 24 countries including China. Additionally, new cases are emerging in different countries and three confirmed cases from India also emerged till compilation of this paper, February 4th, 2020. As of now deaths were reported only from China but now causality in Philippines reported for the first time outside China. The nCoV crisis has been declared as \u2018Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u2019 by WHO. The zoonotic route (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. Bats are considered as the natural reservoir hosts and play a crucial role in transmitting various viruses, including Ebola, Nipah, Coronavirus and others (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCui_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rCui_et+al_2019_a\">Cui et al 2019</a>). A high diversity among zoonotic Alphacoronaviruses and SARS-CoV-related Betacoronaviruses has been found in the circulating bats of Western Europe (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGouilh_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rGouilh_et+al_2018_a\">Gouilh et al 2018</a>). The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable origin of 2019-nCoV. The diversity of CoVs in the bat population needs further investigation in details, as well as the surveillance and monitoring of bats becomes critical to prevent future outbreaks in animals and the public. The recent nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses. Successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines. A report emerged from China where the scientists claimed successful isolation of the 2019nCoV virus in Vero and Huh7 cell lines from infected patients. Subsequently, in aiding the further research for designing rapid diagnostics and vaccine development for nCoV, scientists at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at Melbourne, Australia, were also successful in growing the Wuhan coronavirus in cell culture. Further research is warranted on establishing animal models for the current 2019-nCoV unrevealing viral events of replication, transmission, and pathogenesis in humans. This could provide clues for discovering effective therapeutic regimens and vaccine testing purposes"

            "During the first week of December 2019, a few cases of pneumonia appeared in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province of China. The patients exhibited a history of visiting the local nearby Huanan seafood market which deals in the sale of different live animals, where zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission suspected as the main route of disease origin (Hui et al 2020). Firstly, the affected patients presented with pneumonia-like symptoms, followed by a severe acute respiratory infection. Some cases showed rapid development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) followed by serious complications in the respiratory tract. On Jan 7th, 2020, it was confirmed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that a new coronavirus has emerged and was named 2019-nCoV.

In addition to China, 24 different countries from Europe, Northern America, Southeast Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific Asia have reported the confirmed cases of this disease making the total tally of confirmed cases to 20630 worldwide (Figure 2). Although the mortality rate due to 2019-nCoV is comparatively lesser than the earlier outbreaks of SARS and MERS-CoVs, as well as this virus presents relatively mild manifestations, the total number of cases are increasing speedily and are crossing the old census. There is a high risk of human-to-human transmission which has also been reported in family clusters and medical workers. The infected patients with nCoV exhibit high fever and dyspnea with chest radiographs showing acute invasive lesions in both lungs."

But since the efforts to design and develop any vaccine or antiviral agent to tackle the presently emerging coronavirus pathogen would take some time, therefore till then we need to rely extensively on enforcing highly effective prevention and control measures to minimize the risk of 2019-nCoV transmission and spread to the best feasible extent (Cheng et al 2020). Majority of the vaccines that are being developed for coronaviruses targets the Spike glycoprotein or S protein (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGraham_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rGraham_et+al_2013_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGraham_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rGraham_et+al_2013_a\">Graham et al 2013</a></a>). This is mainly because of the fact that S protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJiang_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rJiang_et+al_2005_a\">Jiang et al 2005</a>). Several kinds of vaccines and antiviral drugs that are based on S protein have been previously evaluated. Among them, the S protein-based vaccines include full-length S protein vaccines, viral vector-based vaccine, DNA-based vaccine, recombinant S proteinbased and recombinant RBD protein-based vaccines. Whereas S protein based antiviral therapies include RBD\u2013ACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cDu_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rDu_et+al_2009_a\">Du et al 2009</a>). Even though such therapeutic options have proven efficacy in the in vitro studies, however most of these haven\u2019t undergone randomized animal or human trials and hence are of limited use in our present 2019-nCoV scenario. Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was intended to be used for the treatment of Ebola virus disease. It also has anti-coronavirus activity due to its inhibitory action on the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSheahan_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rSheahan_et+al_2017_a\">Sheahan et al 2017</a>). At present, efforts are being made to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against 2019-nCoV. Combination therapy with 2019-nCoV specific monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir can be considered as the ideal therapeutic option for 2019-nCoV (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCohen_2020_a\" href=\"#rCohen_2020_a\">Cohen 2020</a>). Further evaluation is required before confirming the efficacy of such combination therapy. A variety of different therapeutic and vaccine designing approaches against coronaviruses are being explored and yet to be evaluated in terms of their potency, efficacy and safety, but hopefully the process of evaluation will be accelerated in the coming days (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCyranoski_2020_a\" href=\"#rCyranoski_2020_a\">Cyranoski 2020</a>; Lu 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cPillaiyar_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rPillaiyar_et+al_2020_a\">Pillaiyar et al 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZaher_et+al_2020_a\" href=\"#rZaher_et+al_2020_a\">Zaher et al 2020</a>)."

        "6. Prevention and control measures": [
            "Seeing the possible role of animals in 2019-nCoV infection, WHO in its advice for public recommended to avoid the unprotected contact with both farm and wild animals (World Health Organization 2020a). The live-animal markets such as in China could provide chances to animal CoVs to get transmitted to humans and these markets may act as critical places for the origin of novel zoonotic pathogens and pose high public health risks during an outbreak.",
            "The emergency pathogens could be counteracted by opting immediate and timely international collaborative efforts, cooperative efforts between human and animal health sectors. Other effective measures include One health approach, implementation of effective prevention and control strategies, rapid communication and networking, and exploring advances in science and technology for developing rapid and confirmatory diagnostics, enhancing disease surveillance and monitoring, implementation of strict biosecurity measures, and timely efforts toward designing appropriate and effective vaccines and therapeutics (Cheng et al 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCohen_2020_a\" href=\"#rCohen_2020_a\">Cohen 2020</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCyranoski_2020_a\" href=\"#rCyranoski_2020_a\">Cyranoski 2020</a>; Lu 2020; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMunjal_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rMunjal_et+al_2017_a\">Munjal et al 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSingh_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rSingh_et+al_2017_a\">Singh et al 2017</a>).",
            "In the present scenario of not having any direct acting anti-viral agent and vaccines, strict implementation of high vigilance for 2019-nCoV and appropriate prevention and control measures are of utmost importance to check the further spread and control of this virus (Cheng et al 2020). Researchers and Authorities (WHO, CDC Atlanta and others) across the globe are working to combat the current ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreaks, identifying the possible origin of this novel virus, and to design and develop effective vaccines and therapeutics (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCohen_2020_a\" href=\"#rCohen_2020_a\">Cohen 2020</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCyranoski_2020_a\" href=\"#rCyranoski_2020_a\">Cyranoski 2020</a>, Lu 2020, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMahase_2020_a\" href=\"#rMahase_2020_a\">Mahase 2020</a>). Studying the virus in details, its molecular biology and immunology, adaptive genetic changes, mutations and recombination events, elucidating clinical pathology and pathogenesis, identifying the route of origin, role of any mixing vessels (like birds, pigs, and mammals), jumping the species barrier, zoonotic potential, human-to-human transmission events, altogether would pave ways for designing effective prevention and control measures to counter 2019-nCoV"
        ],
        "7. Conclusion and future prospects": [
            "The nCoV is the most recently emerging virus after the past episodes and panics haunted by Ebola, Zika and Nipah viruses, as well as earlier emergencies posed by Bird flu and Swine flu viruses. The emerging novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has become a global concern within a short span of time. Since its origin from Wuhan, Hubei province of China in the first week of December 2019, it has claimed 425 lives in China and infected 20630 in 24 countries including China. Additionally, new cases are emerging in different countries and three confirmed cases from India also emerged till compilation of this paper, February 4th, 2020. As of now deaths were reported only from China but now causality in Philippines reported for the first time outside China. The nCoV crisis has been declared as \u2018Public Health Emergency of International Concern\u2019 by WHO. The zoonotic route (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. Bats are considered as the natural reservoir hosts and play a crucial role in transmitting various viruses, including Ebola, Nipah, Coronavirus and others (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCui_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rCui_et+al_2019_a\">Cui et al 2019</a>). A high diversity among zoonotic Alphacoronaviruses and SARS-CoV-related Betacoronaviruses has been found in the circulating bats of Western Europe (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGouilh_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rGouilh_et+al_2018_a\">Gouilh et al 2018</a>). The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable origin of 2019-nCoV. The diversity of CoVs in the bat population needs further investigation in details, as well as the surveillance and monitoring of bats becomes critical to prevent future outbreaks in animals and the public. The recent nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses. Successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines. A report emerged from China where the scientists claimed successful isolation of the 2019nCoV virus in Vero and Huh7 cell lines from infected patients. Subsequently, in aiding the further research for designing rapid diagnostics and vaccine development for nCoV, scientists at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at Melbourne, Australia, were also successful in growing the Wuhan coronavirus in cell culture. Further research is warranted on establishing animal models for the current 2019-nCoV unrevealing viral events of replication, transmission, and pathogenesis in humans. This could provide clues for discovering effective therapeutic regimens and vaccine testing purposes"
