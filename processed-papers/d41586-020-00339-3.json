            "June at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and their colleagues collected immune cells called T cells from three people with cancer. Using a conventional genetic-engineering method, the team gave the T cells the ability to recognize a protein produced by some cancer cells. The researchers also used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to block the T cells\u2019 production of three proteins that might inhibit the cells\u2019 ability to target tumours.",
            "Irie at Nagoya University in Japan looked for bacterial versions of calcium ion channels and identified one in a hot spring bacterium called Meiothermus ruber. Mutation of a single amino acid caused the bacterial ion channel to lose its preference for calcium and deliver other charged molecules, such as sodium, into a cell as well.",
