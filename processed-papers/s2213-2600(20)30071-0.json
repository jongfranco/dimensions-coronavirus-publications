If presenting with dyspnoea and hypoxia (oxygen saturation [SpO2] <93%), prescribe supplemental oxygen, admit to an isolation ward, and assess transfer risk. If patients are deteriorating with measure 3 interventions, the core treatment principle we recommend is antiviral plus antipneumococcus plus anti-Staphylococcus aureus (measure 4, figure). Coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae and S aureus is important as co-infection increases the likelihood of severe illness.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] High-dose nemonoxacin (750 mg once daily) and linezolid is effective against S pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]).",

High-throughput oxygen therapy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation are both effective supportive therapies and target blood SpO2 should be 88\u201390%. Invasive mechanical ventilation is used as a last resort.",
            "Special considerations are given for elderly, immunocompromised, and pregnant patients. Older patients (>65 years) and immuno\u00ad compromised patients should be treated as moderate or severe cases in the initial assessment. Infections in pregnant women might progress rapidly and timely clinical decisions are crucial to provide pregnant women with options, such as induction, anaesthesia, and surgery. Consultation with an obstetric specialist is recom\u00admended and depending on the condition of the mother, termination of the pregnancy is a consideration.",
            "Home care and isolation can relieve the burden on health-care providers of fever clinics. We used this strategy in Wuhan in response to the large volume of patients arriving at health care centres but do not recommend it for other regions where each suspected case can be appropriately isolated and monitored in a health setting. Inappropriate home care can be life threatening for patients and be a detriment to public health.[5]",
            "Many factors contributed to dev\u00ad eloping our clinical algorithm in Wuhan during the early outbreak period. During this time, the influx of patients to fever clinics substantially outweighed the number of phys\u00adicians. Inpatient care was unsafe due to potential crossinfection and supplementary resources were not ready. Applying and waiting for results of an SARS-CoV-2 test was time consuming just after the outbreak and did not aid clinical decision making. We made trade-offs between infection control and standard medical principles and adapted the protocol as more information and resources became available. We hope our experience will serve as guidance for other fever clinics and future cases.",
