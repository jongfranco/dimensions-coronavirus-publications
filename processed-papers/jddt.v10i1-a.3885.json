            "ABSTRACT Radiotracer techniques have been an important topic of discussions and development in pharmaceutical field since a decade and more. These techniques are used to enlighten us with the knowledge of processes occurring inside an organism. Radiotracer is those elements whose atoms are replaced with nucleoids imitating radioactivity, by virtue of which its movement and path can be traced within any organism. These techniques are based on the same principle of enmarking and labeling the essential and abundant elements within plants and animals to crack the steps intermediates and necessities of different pathways and cycles. Most abundant nucleoids found in in the plants or animals are carbon, nitrogen, Phosphorus, oxygen, hydrogen, magnesium, calcium, iodine. These elements are incorporated in the internal entities and environment of the organism. Isotopes must be strong so as to resist metabolic and chemical reactions taking place inside the organism. These techniques not only trace bio pathways but also play a very important role on diagnosing diseases in the plants and animals. Not only tracing the processes is sufficient but detecting all possible ways to keep an organism healthy is important as well. Tracing is performed using various devices and methods like autoradiography, Gamma counter, mass spectrophotometer, scintillation counter etc. Carbon isotopes are used in study of all essential plant mechanism, soil salinization and organic matter studies. Oxygen and hydrogen radiotracers are used in hydrology studies and water cycling studies. Root pattern of crops is studied using Phosphorus. This technique reveals functionalities of thyroid tissue and other body tissues in animals. All this includes suitability of tracer for the environment and behavior in relevant systems. Tracer sampling is performed and interpretation of tracer is done into models and graphs. This is essential for developing a chemical tracer and transporting it within a system. Radiotracer techniques have proved to be efficient in updating basic details of plant and animal metabolic and biosynthetic operations and have made it easy to understand them.

Literature review assembles and compares available data on breast cancer clinical stage, time intervals to care, and access barriers in different countries. It provides evidence that while more than 70% of breast cancer patients in most high-income countries are diagnosed in stages I and II, only 20%-50% patients in the majority of low- and middle income countries are diagnosed in these earlier stages. Recent improvement in the understanding of the molecular and genetic alterations underlying breast cancer progression and development has provided a platform to develop novel therapeutic strategies for breast cancer. According to new hypothesis, the development of novel treatment for breast cancer will result from identification of specific molecular targets that are exposed in studies designed to illuminate the gene and molecules involved in breast tumorigenesis. This review highlights the basic, pathophysiology and classification of breast cancer, challenges including multidrug resistance (by ABC transporter, P-glycoprotein, MDRassociated Protein (MRP1), Breast cancer resistance Protein (BCRP), drug resistance in breast cancer, multidrug resistance in breast cancer cells in vitro), microtubules alteration, altered enzyme, p-53 tumor suppressor gene and cell cycle, alteration in DNA repair processes, cell death response, difficulty to treat metastatic stage, unable to reach the target site.

While the concept of AI may still seem futuristic to some, the era of machine learning is already here. Uptake in pharmacy has been relatively slow compared to in other industries. However, this is gradually changing. AI is developing at a rapid rate and pharma will need to adapt if they want to stay relevant. Broadly, AI is defined as computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. It comprises three distinct types: human-created algorithms, machine-learning, and deep learning. AI serve multiple purposes in pharmacy and healthcare. These include conducting repetitive tasks, data management. analysis of healthcare systems, natural-language processing, medical consultations, digital nurses ,medication management. One of the biggest challenges is overcoming the medical culture that values physician intuition over evidence-based solutions. In order for AI to positively impact patients and healthcare professionals, pharmacy needs to become invested in the conversation by championing the advantages of AI technology. Further, governments can help by investing in the development of AI infrastructures. Once all stakeholders develop a deeper understanding of AI and partnerships are strengthened, patient care and outcomes will ultimately improve.

            "ABSTRACT The oral route is a popular and convenient means of drug delivery. However, despite its advantages, it also has challenges. Many drugs are not suitable for oral delivery due to: first pass metabolism; less than ideal properties; and side-effects of treatment. Additionally, oral delivery relies heavily on patient compliance. Implantable drug delivery devices are an alternative system that can achieve effective delivery with lower drug concentrations, and as a result, minimize side-effects whilst increasing patient compliance. Advancement in technologies, many forms of drug administration and therapies were introduced but providing sustainable release of therapeutic drug concentration and steady release at specific site was major challenge. Implantable drug-delivery systems are being developed to release drugs to the bloodstream continuously as well as free patients from being hospitalized to receive intravenous infusions or frequent injections. One technique is implantation of a pellet in the subcutaneous tissue so the pellet may be released by erosion. Disadvantages to the subcutaneous delivery of drugs include: 1) release of the drug in subcutaneous tissue rather than in the bloodstream directly; 2) entry into the circulatory system is controlled by surrounding blood supplies which vary with fat; 3) diffusion may be difficult due to dense layers of fibrous tissue; and 4) drug amounts cannot be readily regulated.

This differs from traditional radiology and radiotherapy techniques, where radiation is normally applied from an external source. Nuclear medicine has become quite widespread since its inception in the 1950s, and nuclear medicine departments can be found in most medium and large hospitals. In nuclear medicine therapy, the radiation treatment dose is administered internally (e.g. intravenous or oral routes) rather than from an external radiation source. The radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine therapy emit ionizing radiation that travels only a short distance, thereby minimizing unwanted side effects and damage to noninvolved organs or nearby structures. Radiotracers are considered a special group of drugs and thus their preparation and use are regulated by a set of policies that have been adopted by individual member countries. The Radiotracers used in diagnostic examinations are administered in very small doses.

            "ABSTRACT Forced degradation studies include the degradation of new drug substance and drug product at conditions more severe than accelerated conditions. These studies illustrate the chemical stability of the molecule which further facilitates the development of stable formulation with suitable storage conditions. Stress testing a drug substance can help identify the likely degradation products, which can in turn help establish the degradation pathways and the intrinsic stability of the molecule and validate the stability-indicating power of the analytical procedures used. The nature of the stress testing will depend on the individual drug substance and the type of drug product. Photo stability testing should consist of two parts: forceddegradation testing and confirmatory testing. The purpose of forced-degradation testing is to evaluate the overall photosensitivity of the material for method-development purposes and/or degradation pathway elucidation. ICH guidelines demonstrate certain degradation conditions like light, oxidation, dry heat, acidic, basic, hydrolysis etc. ICH Q1A, QIB and Q2B exemplify the forced degradation studies. This review overviews the strategic approaches and trends in forced degradation studies. Various chromatographic techniques are utilized for the forced degradation studies of drug substances and products. Various analytical techniques used for the assay and forced degradation of drug substances includes UV, RP-HPLC, HPTLC etc or even hyphenated techniques like LC- MS, GC- MS etc may be used for the further structural elucidation of the compounds. The LC- MS technique can help in the characterization of various degradation products formed. This will ultimately help in developing more stable formulations of the selected drug.

            "ABSTRACT TB is an infectious disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It spreads from person to person primarily through the air, and it most often affects the lungs. If this disease not treated at proper time, it can be incurable. It typically affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can affect other sites as well (extra pulmonary TB). Tuberculosis can be cured with combinations of first line anti-tuberculosis drugs like Isoniazid, Rifampin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol & Streptomycin and in multi-drug resistant with second line anti TB drugs like Thiacetazone, Ethionamide, Para amino salicyclic acid, Cycloserine, Kanamycin , Amikacin and also other fluroquinolons. The TB patient on treatment is taking more than one anti-TB medicine simultaneously and regimens last from many months to two years or more. This increases the likelihood of adverse drug reaction. Most patients on treatment for drug-resistant TB experience at least one side-effect and two thirds of such patients have had at least one medicine stopped temporarily or permanently as a result of adverse drug reaction. These ADRs damage public confidence and affect patient adherence. Pharmacovigilance (PV) needs to be an integral accompaniment to treatment programs. The most common adverse drug reaction found in present study is anorexia along with nausea, vomiting and gastritis in enrolled patient\u2019s occurred during the first 2\u20133 weeks of treatment.

Acyclovir is an antiviral agent preferentially used in the treatment of infections caused by herpes simplex virus and highly useful to treat herpes simplex keratitis. The significant problem in the ocular drug delivery is the achievement of optimal drug concentration at the site of action. Development of therapeutic agents which need a repeated long-term administration is a carter for the sustained release drug delivery systems, to result in less frequent dosing and less invasive techniques. Therefore, in- situ gel a novel drug delivery system has been developed to overcome the anatomical barriers and ocular bioavailability constrains. Gellan gum natural polymer was used as the gelling agent and also acted as a viscosity enhancing agent. The prepared formulations were evaluated for pH, viscosity, clarity, drug content, gelling capacity, in vitro drug release. The developed in-situ gel provided sustained drug release over a 6 hours period of time. The optimized formulation was found to be nonirritating with no ocular damage to the cornea and conjunctiva. Hence the developed formulation can be used as an in-situ gelling vehicle by virtue of its increased corneal residence time and prolonged drug release could be considered a viable alternative to achieving enhanced bioavailability and helped in the reduction in the frequency of instillation thereby resulting in better patient compliance.

            "ABSTRACT The concept of floating drug delivery system is described in the 1968. FDDS of microsphere is the novel drug delivery system. Floating drug delivery system of microsphere have a bulk density less than gastric fluids and so remain buoyant in the stomach without affecting gastric emptying rate for a prolonged period of time. Several approaches have been used to retain the dosage form in stomach as a way of enhancing the gastric residence time which includes floatation systems, high-density systems, mucoadhesive systems or swellable systems and superporous hydrogel are novel drug delivery system to maximize efficiency of drug. The attention behind floating microspheres is due to the uniformity of these multiple-unit dosage forms in the stomach, which results in more reproducible drug absorption and reduced risk of local irritation. These systems have more benefits over the single unit dosage forms. Microspheres are free flowing powders made up of proteins or synthetic polymers which are biodegradable in nature and ideally having a particle size less than 200 \u03bcm. Microspheres have high loading capacity and many polymers have been used such as albumin, gelatin, starch, polymethacrylate, polyacrylamine, and polyalkylcyanoacrylate. The gastroretentive dosage form resides in the stomach for longer period of time than predictable dosage forms. These systems provide tremendous opportunities in the design of new controlled and delayed release oral formulations, thus extending of futuristic pharmaceutical development.

While P. falciparum causes most malaria-induced mortality worldwide, P. vivax is the major cause of malaria morbidity. In this study we have compared two different brands of Arteether (EMAL and MATCH) for treating P. vivax initially. ArteetherTM is a useful drug against chloroquine-resistant P. vivax malaria, without an increased incidence of toxicity. It has a longer half-life, and has more lipophilic properties than artemetherTM, which aids its accumulation in brain tissues for the treatment of cerebral malaria. The study revealed that there was a significant difference in the effectiveness of these two formulations even though they were labeled to have similar indications. These indicate the need for prior examination of these kinds of products for their intended activity. The results of this study have provided evidence to support the better effectiveness of EMAL- brand over MATCH- brand. As EMAL has less viscosity, very good redispersibility, larger zone of inhibition. By observing all of these properties we can conclude that EMAL is a better formulation than MATCH, and can show better Antimalarial property in patient suffering from Plasmodium malaria.

The conventional role of pharmacist has transformed from custodian of prescription medicines into an active health care provider. The renewed role of pharmacist has emerged due to demand from co-healthcare workers, doctors and mainly from patients. Pharmacist is just like a messenger or mediator between doctor and patients. Pharmacy technicians actually communicate and explain clearly the prescription and dose regimen dictated by the doctors to patients. The emergence of information technology in health sciences has put forth the challenge of integrating basic health sciences with applied pharmaceutical sciences in the direction to offer optimized and best healthcare delivery to the patients. Healthcare delivery is no more a domain or responsibility of individual professionals but team work of allied healthcare providers like doctors who diagnose, pharmacists who scrutinize prescriptions and educate patients while nurses are those who render the nursing services to patients. In this modern society, the cost of the treatment and crisis on human resources for healthcare has made it difficult to deliver quality care to all the patients.

            "ABSTRACT Oral route is the most common safe and convenient route for the administration of drugs. Orally administered drugs should possess very good aqueous solubility for better absorption and bioavailability. Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) are novel drug delivery systems that were created with the objective to enhance the bioavailability of poor aqueous soluble drugs. SEDDS belong to the group of lipid-based formulations which are easily manufactured by using physically stable isotropic mixtures of oil, surfactants, co-surfactants and solubilized drug substances. In gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) this systems form fine emulsions of globule size less than 5\u03bcm in diameter and or micro-emulsions having globule size as small as 10 nm in diameter with mild agitation provided by gastric mobility. The process of self-emulsification is dependent on various diverse factors such as the nature of oil, surfactant, co-surfactant, oil/surfactant ratio, and the polarity of the emulsion. SEDDS are a promising approach for the formulation of drug compounds with poor aqueous solubility. In the gastrointestinal tract, these systems are spontaneously emulsified and they are packed in hard or soft gelatin capsules, which form the emulsions when they are dispersed in the gastric fluids. Now a days several formulations are commercially available which utilize selfemulsifying drug delivery technology. SEDDS may have future potential in increasing the rate and extent of absorption of orally administered drugs. This poster attempts to present an overview on the self-emulsifying drug delivery system along with their mechanism, evaluation and its applications.
