        "abstract": "Background As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, epidemiological data are needed to guide situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks.\nMethods In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time.",

Geographical coverage is hetero\u00ad geneous in our line list, and we have a notable deficit of cases from Hubei province, the foci of the COVID-19 outbreak. We expect that little patient-level information is shared on social media by province-level and city-level health authorities in Wuhan and Hubei province because health systems are overwhelmed. For similar reasons, provinces with a large total case count at the end of January, 2020, or with a weaker health infrastructure, were under-represented in our line list, with the exception of Beijing. Other limitations in our data include severity (only patients who had severe enough symptoms to seek care were captured) and changes in case definition. A series of epidemiological criteria were required for COVID-19 testing, including travel history to Wuhan within the past 2 weeks; residence in Wuhan within the past 2 weeks; contact with individuals from Wuhan (with fever and respiratory symptoms) within the past 2 weeks; and being part of an established disease cluster. Some of these criteria (eg, relation to Wuhan) were relaxed over time (appendix). As a result, we have an overrepresentation of travel-related cases in our database."

            "Evidence before this study An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recognised in early January, 2020, in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China. The new virus is thought to have originated from an animal-to-human spillover event linked to seafood and live-animal markets. The infection has spread locally in Wuhan and elsewhere in China, despite strict intervention measures implemented in the region where the infection originated on Jan 23, 2020. More than 500 patients infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China have been reported between Jan 1 and Feb 14, 2020. Although laboratory testing for COVID-19 quickly ramped up in China and elsewhere, information on individual patients remains scarce and official datasets have not been made publicly available. Patient-level information is important to estimate key time-to-delay events (such as the incubation period and interval between symptom onset and visit to a hospital), analyse the age profile of infected patients, reconstruct epidemic curves by onset dates, and infer transmission parameters. We searched PubMed for publications between Jan 1, 1990, and Feb 6, 2020, using combinations of the following terms: (\u201ccoronavirus\u201d OR \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d) AND (\u201cline list\u201d OR \u201ccase description\u201d OR \u201cpatient data\u201d) AND (\u201cdigital surveillance\u201d OR \u201csocial media\u201d OR \u201ccrowd-sourced data\u201d). The search retrieved one relevant study on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus that mentioned FluTrackers in their discussion, a website that aggregates epidemiological information on emerging pathogens. However, FluTrackers does not report individual-level data on COVID-19.",
            "Added value of this study To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses crowdsourced data from social media sources to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak. We searched DXY.cn, a Chinese health-care-oriented social network that broadcasts information from local and national health authorities, to reconstruct patient-level information on COVID-19 in China. We also queried international media sources and national health agency websites to collate data on international exportations of COVID-19. We describe the demographic characteristics, delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting for 507 patients infected with COVID-19 reported until Jan 31, 2020. The overall cumulative progression of the outbreak is consistent between our line list and an official report published by the Chinese national health authorities on Jan 28, 2020. The estimated incubation period in our data aligns with that of previous work. Our dataset was made available in the public domain on Jan 21, 2020.",
            "Implications of all the available evidence Crowdsourced line-list data can be reconstructed from social media data, especially when a central resource is available to curate relevant information. Public access to line lists is important so that several teams with different expertise can provide their own insights and interpretations of the data, especially in the early phase of an outbreak when little information is available. Publicly available line lists can also increase transparency. The main issue with the quality of patient-level data obtained during health emergencies is the potential lack of information from locations overwhelmed by the outbreak (in this case, Hubei province and other provinces with weaker health infrastructures). Future studies based on larger samples of patients with COVID-19 could explore in more detail the transmission dynamics of the outbreak in different locations, the effectiveness of interventions, and the demographic factors driving transmission.",

Several teams have used our dataset and datasets from others to estimate a mean incubation period for COVID-19 to be 5\u20136 days (95% CI 2\u201311).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] Our own estimate (median 4\u00b75 days [IQR 3\u00b70\u20135\u00b75]) is consistent with previous work that used other modelling approaches.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] The incubation period is a useful parameter to guide isolation and contact tracing; based on existing data, the disease status of a contact should be known with near certainty after a period of observation of 14 days.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] Availability of a public dataset enables independent estimation of important epidemiological parameters by several teams, allowing for confirmation and cross-checking at a time when information can be conflicting and noisy.",
            "An interesting finding in our data relates to the age distribution of patients. We found a heavy skew of infection towards older age groups, with substantially fewer children infected. This pattern could indicate agerelated differences in susceptibility to infection, severe outcomes, or behaviour. However, a substantial portion of the patients in our database are travellers, a population that is usually predominantly adults (although does not exclude children). Furthermore, because patient data in our dataset were captured by the health system, they are biased towards the more severe spectrum of the disease, especially for patients from mainland China. Clinical reports have shown that severity of COVID-19 is associated with the presence of chronic conditions,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] which are more frequent in older age groups. Nevertheless, we",
            "would also expect children younger than 5 years to be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the healthcare system, as is seen for other respiratory infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]",
            "Biological differences could have a role in shaping these age profiles. A detailed analysis of one of the early COVID-19 clusters by Chan and colleagues[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] revealed symptomatic infections in five adult members of the same household, while a child in the same household aged 10 years was infected but remained asymptomatic, potentially indicating biological differences in the risk of clinical disease driven by age. Previous immunity from infection with a related coronavirus has been speculated to potentially protect children from SARS,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] and so might also have a role in COVID-19. In any case, if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be confirmed and the epidemic were to progress globally, we would expect an increase in respiratory mortality concentrated among people aged 30 years and older. This mortality pattern would be substantially different from the profile of the 2009 influenza pandemic, for which excess mortality was concentrated in those younger than 65 years.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]",
            "In our dataset, we saw a rapid increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 in several provinces of China, consistent with local transmission outside of Hubei province. As of Jan 31, 2020, province-level epidemic curves are only available by date of reporting, rather than date of symptom onset, which usually inflates recent case counts if detection has increased.",
            "Furthermore, province-level data include both returning travellers from Hubei province (ie, importations) and locally acquired cases, which also usually inflate the apparent risk of local transmission. Notably, other lines of evidence suggest that local transmission is now well established outside of Hubei province, because travel increased just before the Chinese New Year on Jan 25, 2020, and before implementation of the travel ban in Wuhan.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] Accordingly, our own data include evidence of transmission clusters in non-travellers, with, for instance, a second-generation transmission event reported in Shaanxi on Jan 21, 2020.",
            "Our study had several limitations, one of which was the data we used. Although all provinces in mainland China provide aggregated information on infections and deaths, individual-level patient descriptions are only available for a subset of provinces. Geographical coverage is hetero\u00ad geneous in our line list, and we have a notable deficit of cases from Hubei province, the foci of the COVID-19 outbreak. We expect that little patient-level information is shared on social media by province-level and city-level health authorities in Wuhan and Hubei province because health systems are overwhelmed. For similar reasons, provinces with a large total case count at the end of January, 2020, or with a weaker health infrastructure, were under-represented in our line list, with the exception of Beijing. Other limitations in our data include severity (only patients who had severe enough symptoms to seek care were captured) and changes in case definition. A series of epidemiological criteria were required for COVID-19 testing, including travel history to Wuhan within the past 2 weeks; residence in Wuhan within the past 2 weeks; contact with individuals from Wuhan (with fever and respiratory symptoms) within the past 2 weeks; and being part of an established disease cluster. Some of these criteria (eg, relation to Wuhan) were relaxed over time (appendix). As a result, we have an overrepresentation of travel-related cases in our database.",
            "The reproduction number is an important quantity for outbreak control. We refrained from estimating this www.thelancet.com/digital-health Published online February 20, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30026-1",
            "parameter because reporting changes could bias estimates relying on epidemic growth rates. Furthermore, our dataset captured cases all over China and does not reflect transmission patterns in any particular location. A mean reproduction number of 2\u00b75\u20132\u00b77 has previously been estimated on the basis of the volume of importations of international cases in the pre-intervention period in Wuhan.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]",
            "We recognise that, although our data source is useful and timely, it should not replace official statistics. Manual compilation of detailed line lists from media sources is highly time consuming and is not sustainable when case counts reach several thousands. Here we provide detailed data on 507 patients when the official case count was over 9000 by Jan 31, 2020, representing a sample of approximately 5% of reported cases and a much smaller proportion of the full spectrum of COVID-19 cases, which include mild infections. A crowds\u00adourced system would not be expected to catch all cases, especially if many cases are too mild to be captured by the health-care system, digital surveillance, or social media. Notably, DXY.cn does not generate data outside of traditional surveillance systems but rather provides a channel of rapid communication between the public and health authorities. In turn, our approach has helped extract and repackage information from health authorities into an analytical format, which was not available elsewhere.",
            "At the time of writing, efforts are underway to coordinate compilation of COVID-19 data from online sources across several academic teams. Ultimately, we expect that a line list of patients will be shared by government sources with the global community; however, data cleaning and access issues might take a prohibitively long time to resolve. For the west African Ebola outbreak, a similarly coordinated effort to publish a line list took 2 years.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Given the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak, such a long delay would be counterproductive.",
            "Overall, the novelty of our approach was to rely on a unique source for social media and news reports in China, which aggregated and curated relevant information. This approach facilitated entry of robust and standard data on clinical and demographic information. Reassuringly, DXY.cn maintains a special section dedicated to debunking fake news, myths, and rumours about the COVID-19 outbreak. Looking to the future, collection of patient data in the context of emergencies could include information on whether patients are identified through contact tracing or because they seek care on their own. Furthermore, data interpretability could be improved by gathering more quantitative information on how case definitions are used in practice.",
            "In conclusion, crowdsourced epidemiological data can be useful to monitor emerging outbreaks, such as COVID-19 and, as previously, Ebola virus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] These efforts can help generate and disseminate detailed information in the early stages of an outbreak when little other data",
            "are available, enabling independent estimation of key parameters that affect interventions. Based on our small sample of patients with COVID-19, we note an intriguing age distribution, reminiscent of that of SARS, which warrants further epidemiological and serological studies. We also report early signs that the response is strengthening in China on the basis of a decrease in case detection time, and rapid management of travel-related infections that are identified internationally. This is an early report of a rapidly evolving situation and the parameters discussed here could change quickly. In the coming weeks, we will continue to monitor the epidemiology of this outbreak using data from news reports and official sources.",
