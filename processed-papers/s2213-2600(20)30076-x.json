After receiving medication, his body temperature reduced from 39\u00b70 to 36\u00b74 \u00b0C. However, his cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue did not improve. On day of illness, after initial presentation, chest x-ray showed progressive infiltrate and diffuse gridding shadow in both lungs. He refused ventilator support in the intensive care unit repeatedly because he suffered from claustro\u00ad phobia; there\u00adfore, he received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy (60% concentration, flow rate 40 L/min). On day of illness, the patient\u2019s symptoms had still not improved, but oxygen saturation remained above 95%. In the afternoon of day of illness, his hypoxaemia and shortness of breath worsened. Despite receiving HFNC oxygen therapy (100% concentration, flow rate 40 L/min), oxygen saturation values decreased to 60%, and the patient had sudden cardiac arrest. He was immediately given invasive ventilation, chest com\u00ad pression, and adrenaline injection. Unfortunately, the rescue was not successful, and he died at 18:31 (Beijing time).",
            "Biopsy samples were taken from lung, liver, and heart tissue of the patient. Histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates (figure 2A, B). The right lung showed evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline mem\u00adbrane formation, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; figure 2A). The left lung tissue displayed pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation, suggestive of early-phase ARDS (figure 2B). Inters\u00adtitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, were seen in both lungs. Multin\u00ad ucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes character\u00adised by large nuclei, amphophilic granular cyto\u00ad plasm, and prominent nucleoli were identified in the intraalveolar spaces, showing viral cytopathic-like changes. No obvious intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions were identified.",

There were a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infilt\u00adrates, but no other substantial damage in the heart tissue (figure 2D).",
            "Peripheral blood was prepared for flow cytometric analysis. We found that the counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells were substantially reduced, while their status was hyperactivated, as evidenced by the high proportions of HLA-DR (CD4 3\u00b747%) and CD38 (CD8 39\u00b74%) double-positive fractions (appendix p 3). Moreover, there was an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4 T cells (appendix p 3). Additionally, CD8 T cells were found to harbour high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, in which 31\u00b76% cells were perforin positive, 64\u00b72% cells were granulysin positive, and 30\u00b75% cells were granulysin and perforin double-positive (appendix p 3). Our results imply that overactivation of T cells, manifested by increase of Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, accounts for, in part, the severe immune injury in this patient.",
            "X-ray images showed rapid progression of pneumonia and some differences between the left and right lung. In addition, the liver tissue showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular activity, but there was no conclusive evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury as the cause. There were no obvious histological changes seen in heart tissue, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection might not directly impair the heart.",
            "Although corticosteroid treatment is not routinely recommended to be used for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] according to our pathological findings of pulmonary oedema and hyaline membrane formation, timely and appropriate use of corticosteroids together with ventilator support should be considered for the severe patients to prevent ARDS development.",
