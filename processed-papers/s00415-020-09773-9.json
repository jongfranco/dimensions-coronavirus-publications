            "The onset of oculomotor nerve palsy was associated with several disorders, including intracranial aneurysm, cerebro\u00ad vascular disease, brain tumor, demyelination disease, periph\u00ad eral neuropathy, inflammatory disease, and so on. Intrac\u00ad ranial aneurysm is the leading cause of oculomotor nerve palsy. The main clinical manifestations include headache, ptosis, and restriction in eye movements with or without changes in the pupil. The MRA of patient was negative and the clinical manifestations were inconformity for aneurysm. Cerebrovascular disease involved infarction or bleeding of brainstem, pituitary apoplexy was excluded by MRI scan. Short course of disease and MRI scan also excluded brain tumor. Owing to the age of patient and MRI scan, the demy\u00ad elination disease was not taken into account. The diabetes mellitus was well controlled with random blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C at normal range. Therefore, diabetic peripheral neuropathy was excluded. Some patients of GBS were associated with oculomotor nerve palsy. Nonetheless, the patient\u2019s tendon reflexes and sensation test were normal which were not in accord with GBS. Finally, infected disease was in accord with the patient. Patient\u2019s chest CT manifes\u00ad tation and throat swab sample were positive for the 2019nCoV. The 2019-nCoV pneumonia was likely to interpret that the chest CT manifestations and inflammatory reaction resulted in oculomotor nerve palsy.",
            "From the patient admission, the patient received moxi\u00ad floxacin (400 mg once every day), oseltamivir (75 mg once every day), methylprednisolone (40 mg once every day), ribavirin (0.5 g once every day), lopinavir (400 mg twice every day), and immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg once every day) combined treatments. During this time, oxygen therapy was persistent supportive treatment. Antipyretic therapy consist\u00ad ing of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 8 h and 600 mg of ibuprofen every 12 h. Unfortunately, his illness got worse and he was dead at admission day 12 because of respiratory failure.",
            "In December 2019, a large number of infected pneu\u00ad monia cases suddenly appeared in Wuhan. The etiology of these infections was the 2019-nCoV, possibly connected to zoonotic or environmental exposure from the Huanan sea\u00ad food market in Wuhan. Human coronavirus is one of the main pathogens of respiratory infection. The two highly pathogenic viruses, SARSC\u00ad oV and MERSC\u00ad oV, cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans and four other human corona viruses (HCoV2\u00ad 29E, HCoV\u00adOC43, HCoVH\u00ad KU1, and HCoV\u00adNL63) induce mild upper respiratory disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. The sequence of 2019\u00adnCoV is relatively different from the six other coronavirus subtypes but can be classified as betacoronavirus. The 2019-nCoV uses the receptor, ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) to infect cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. The process of infection generates high levels of angiotensin II (Ang II), which can lead to increases in vascular permeabil\u00ad ity and pulmonary oedema, even often lethal lung failure in patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Owing to 2019-nCoV infections, high amount of cytokines and corticosteroids was used frequently for treatment of patients with severe illness, for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory-induced lung injury. Some stud\u00ad ies reported that receiving corticosteroids treatment delayed viral clearance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Therefore, according to WHO interim guidance, corticosteroids should not be routinely given sys\u00ad temically [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. According to the current data, the 2019\u00adnCoV is a highly contagious virus with mortality 11\u201315% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. This report describes a case involving an adult patient first onset of acute left oculomotor nerve palsy with 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia that was identified based on chest CT findings and throat swab sample test. In this case, no clinical, laboratory, or imaging examinations showed any indication of an underlying structural cause of the oculomotor nerve injury, suggesting that the 2019-nCoV infection might have caused the acute oculomotor nerve palsy in this case. Why focal neurological deficits may arise following 2019-nCoV infections remains unclear. Pathological mechanisms, such as virus infection invasion or inflammatory factors accom\u00ad panying the effects, are commonly suggested. On the other hand, the virus infection may directly damage the myelin sheaths and surrounding axons due to complications such as GBS, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, and optic neuritis. The hypothesis suggests that oculomotor nerve palsy could be triggered by the same mechanism. The 2019-nCov-induced waterfall inflamma\u00ad tion reaction led to respiratory failure and resulted in death. Unfortunately, cerebrospinal fluid examination was not examined. Although the MRI test was negative, whether the inflammatory factors invaded brainstem was unknown. To the best of my knowledge, the case was the first reported that the 2019-nCoV infection resulted in oculomotor nerve palsy. It is possible that the same symptoms or signs may be observed with rare etiology.",
