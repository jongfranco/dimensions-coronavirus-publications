As cases continue to rise, and spread worldwide, governments and institutions are taking action to prepare for the first patients in Africa.",
            "\u201cThe risk and likelihood of getting an outbreak is very, very high\u201d, said Ambrose Talisuna, the WHO Africa team lead for emergency preparedness. As of Feb 11, Africa does not have any confirmed cases, but suspected patients have been quarantined in Ethiopia, Kenya, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Botswana.",
            "Dr Tedros announced on Feb 5 that a US$675 million prepared\u00ad ness and response plan covering February to April, 2020, had been initiated by the international community for China and globally to protect states with weaker health systems.",
            "WHO has prioritised support for 13 countries on the basis of their close transport links with China: Algeria, Angola, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.",
            "\u201cWe all know how fragile health systems [are] in the African continent, they are already overwhelmed by many outbreaks. For us, it is critical to detect coronavirus earlier [so] that we can prevent spreading within communities that can trigger a number of cases that can overwhelm the treatment capacity\u201d, said Michel",
            "Yao, WHO Africa programme manager for emergency operations.",
            "The strategy is to prepare country technical guidance, advising minis\u00ad tries of health on how to limit human-to-human transmission,",
            "\u201c\u2018This disease is a serious threat to the social dynamics, economic growth, and security of Africa\u2018...\u201c",
            "ensure countries have capacity to isolate and provide appropriate treatment to affected people, Yao said.",
            "The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) established the Africa Task Force for Novel Coronavirus on Feb 3. It is working with WHO on surveil\u00adlance, including screening at points of entry, infection prevention and control in health-care facilities, clinical management of people with severe 2019-nCoV infection, laboratory diag\u00adnosis, and risk communication and community engagement.",
            "The Director of Africa CDC, John Nkengasong, outlined the threat to Africa posed by 2019-nCoV. \u201cThis disease is a serious threat to the social dynamics, economic growth, and security of Africa\u201d, said Nkengasong. \u201cIf we do not detect and contain disease outbreaks early, we cannot achieve our developmental goals.\u201d",
            "Yao said WHO is working with various partners to ensure that there is a proper screening process at the main points of entry, that suspected cases are isolated, and that protective equipment is provided. The guidance requires that alerts be raised on suspected cases. Health workers have been taught how to behave in front of people with suspected or confirmed infection. In-country incidence management teams have also been set up.",
            "Even in countries where there is instability, such as South Sudan, coordination mechanisms have been worked out to reach health workers and patients. Thanks to Ebola, Yao said, most of the countries have isolation infrastructure. \u201cWe are pushing for the continent to be very vigilant\u201d, he added.",
            "Hilde De Clerck, emerging infec\u00ad tions adviser with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, made the point that some health systems are already well organised and have able leadership but will have to adapt to respond successfully to an outbreak.",
            "South Africa\u2019s National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Senegal\u2019s Institut Pasteur were initially the only referral laboratories on the continent, and so were responsible for testing samples from other African countries. By Feb 4, more countries\u2014Ghana, Madagascar, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria\u2014were also able to do testing themselves. As of Feb 10, WHO said that 11 countries were capable of testing for 2019-nCoV, and reagents should be delivered to other countries this week.",
            "Africa\u2019s preparedness efforts have been boosted with $25 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with some of it going towards training.",
            "15 experts from the African Union received training on laboratory diagnosis for 2019-nCoV in Dakar, Senegal, on Feb 6\u20138. WHO is also supporting training in Ethiopia and other countries on isolation and treatment and care of infected patients."
