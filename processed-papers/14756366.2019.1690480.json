        "abstract": "There were severe panics caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus. Therefore, researches targeting these viruses have been required. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been rising targets of some flavonoids. The antiviral activity of some flavonoids against CoVs is presumed directly caused by inhibiting 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Here, we applied a flavonoid library to systematically probe inhibitory compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were found to efficiently block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The interaction of the three flavonoids was confirmed using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method, too. An induced-fit docking analysis indicated that S1, S2 and S30 sites are involved in binding with flavonoids. The comparison with previous studies showed that Triton X-100 played a critical role in objecting false positive or overestimated inhibitory activity of flavonoids. With the systematic analysis, the three flavonoids are suggested to be templates to design functionally improved inhibitors.",

        "discussion": [
            "Flavonoids are an important kind of natural products. In particular, they belong to a type of plant secondary metabolites with a polyphenolic structure widely found in fruits and vegetables. They have miscellaneous reciprocal biochemical and antioxidant effects associated with various diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and atherosclerosis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. It is due to antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagens and anti-cancer-causing properties combined with the ability to control major cell enzyme functions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Intriguingly, some flavonoids also have antiviral activity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Specifically, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, amentoflavone[28], quercetin, daidzein, puerarin, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate[29] and kaempferol[30] were reported to inhibit the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Therefore, the antiviral effect is presumed to be directly linked to suppress the activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in some cases. However, the systematic analysis using various scaffolds of flavonoids was not reported. In order to find the best scaffold to inhibit the function of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, an assay with various flavonoid derivatives classified in 10 scaffolds was built and performed. Among them, the best compounds were one flavonol, herbacetin and two flavones, rhoifolin and pectolinarin. In the current assay method including 0.01% Triton X-100, the three flavonoids showed the better inhibitory activity than the previously reported flavonoids as mentioned above[28\u201330]. The aggregating tendency of flavonoids frequently leads to obtain false bioassay results and can be avoided by adding 0.01% Triton X-10024. It is worthwhile to note that amentoflavone, the most effective flavonoid inhibiting SARS-CoV 3CLpro[28], did not effectively function in the presence of 0.01% Triton X-100 (Figure 5)."

            "There were severe panics caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus. Therefore, researches targeting these viruses have been required. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been rising targets of some flavonoids. The antiviral activity of some flavonoids against CoVs is presumed directly caused by inhibiting 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Here, we applied a flavonoid library to systematically probe inhibitory compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were found to efficiently block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The interaction of the three flavonoids was confirmed using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method, too. An induced-fit docking analysis indicated that S1, S2 and S30 sites are involved in binding with flavonoids. The comparison with previous studies showed that Triton X-100 played a critical role in objecting false positive or overestimated inhibitory activity of flavonoids. With the systematic analysis, the three flavonoids are suggested to be templates to design functionally improved inhibitors.",

Since there is no vaccine and effective therapy for these viral infections, developing anti-SARS drugs against future outbreaks remains a formidable challenge.",
            "SARS- and MERS-CoVs genomes contain two open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b translated to two respective viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab by host ribosomes. ORF1a encodes two cysteine proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro). While PLpro cuts the first three cleavage sites of its polyprotein, 3CLpro is responsible for cleavage of the remaining 11 locations resulting in release of a total of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp) in both SARS- and MERS-CoVs. The homodimeric form of 3CLpro is active in the presence of substrates. The crystal structures of both 3CLpros showed that each monomer is composed of three structural domains: domains I and II form a chymotrypsin-like architecture with a catalytic cysteine and are connected to a third C-terminal domain via a long loop[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. In the proteolytic site, all 3CLpros prefer glutamine at P1 position and leucine, basic residues, small hydrophobic residues at P2, P3 and P4 positions, respectively[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. At P10 and P20 positions, small residues are required. However, P30 position shows no strong preference. Since the autocleavage process is essential for viral propagation, 3CLpro is a good drug target for anti-coronaviral infection.",
            "In this study, we employed a proteolytic method to probe SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory compounds. A synthetic peptide labelled with an Edans-Dabcyl FRET (Fluorescence resonance energy transfer) pair[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] was used to search SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory compounds against a flavonoid library. Recent studies showed that flavonoids have antiviral activity in some viruses including SARS-CoV13\u201317. However, a molecular level study has not been reported for SARS-CoV. Therefore, we performed the proteolytic assay with flavonoids followed by an induced-fit docking experiment with top hits. With the results, we tried to deduce a structural and functional relationship of flavonoids crucial to binding with SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The information can be applied to develop synthetic compounds with better affinities.",

            "The custom-synthesised fluorogenic substrate, DABCYLKTSAVLQSGFRKME-EDANS (ANYGEN, Gwangju, Korea), was used as a substrate for the proteolytic assay using the SARS-CoV 3CLpro[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. This substrate contains the nsp4/nsp[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] cleavage sequence, GVLQ#SG19, and works as a generic peptide substrate for many coronavirus including the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The peptide was dissolved in distilled water and incubated with each protease. A SpectraMax i3x Multi-mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices) was used to measure spectral-based fluorescence. The proteolytic activity was determined at 310 K by following the increase in fluorescence (kexcitation 1\u20444 340 nm, kemission 1\u20444 490 nm, bandwidths 1\u20444 9, 15 nm, respectively) of EDANS upon peptide hydrolysis as a function of time. Assays were conducted in black, 96-well plates (Nunc) in 300 ll assay buffers containing protease and substrate as follow; For the SARS-CoV 3CLpro assay, 4.05 ll of 0.074 mM protease containing 50 mM Tris pH 6.5 was incubated with 7.5 ll of 0.1 mM substrate at 310 K for 2 h before measuring Relative Fluorescence Unit (RFU). Before the assay, the emission spectra of 64 flavonoids were surveyed after illuminating at 340 nm to avoid the overlapping with the emission spectrum of EDANS. Every compound was suitable to be tested. The final concentration of the protease, peptide and chemical used at the assay was 1, 2.5 and 20 lM each. At first, the SARS-CoV 3CLpro and chemical were mixed and pre-incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the substrate and each well was incubated at 310 K for 16 h. After that, we measured the fluorescence of the mixture on the black 96-well plate using the endpoint mode of SpectraMax i3x where the excitation wavelength was fixed to 340 nm and the emission wavelength was set to 490 nm using 9, 15 nm bandwidth, respectively. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. Among the first 64 flavonoids (Supplementary Table 1), three of them were picked up to further assay at a concentration range of 2\u2013320 lM. The IC50 value which is the value causing 50% inhibition of the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 7.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).",

            "To confirm the feasibility of the assay method independently, the fluorescence spectra from the tryptophan of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with candidate inhibitors were investigated[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. The fluorescence measurements were recorded with a SpectraMax i3x Multi-mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 300\u2013500 nm, respectively. The optimal excitation and emission wavelengths were determined by SoftMax Pro. One tryptophan of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro showed a fluorescence emission with a peak at 350 nm after the excitation at the wavelength of 290 nm. In contrast, the flavonoids were almost non-fluorescent under the same experiment condition. Each 40 lM chemical was incubated with 1 lM the SARS-CoV 3CLpro for 1 h and the fluorescence intensity of the mixture was measured.",
            "All the docking and scoring calculation were performed using the Schro\u20acdinger software suite (Maestro, version 11.8.012). The compounds were extracted from the PubChem database in the SDF format and were combined in one file. The file was then imported into Maestro and prepared for docking using LigPrep. The atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (4WY3) were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank and prepared by removing all solvent and adding hydrogens and minimal minimisation in the presence of bound ligand using Protein Preparation Wizard. Ioniser was used to generate an ionised state of all compounds at the target pH 7 \u00b1 2. This prepared low-energy conformers of the ligand were taken as the input for an inducedfit docking.

As shown in Supplementary Figure 1, only a slight increase in catalyst activity was observed up to 0.1% Triton X-100. Therefore, the assay was performed at a concentration of 0.01% Triton X-100 with no significant interference detected.",
            "To independently confirm the inhibitory activity of flavonoids, a general tryptophan-based assay method was employed. Tryptophan was well known to emit its fluorescence. Therefore, if tryptophan is positioned adequately in proteins, the change of fluorescence intensity can reflect the binding state of chemicals and be used to judge interaction between proteins and chemicals. The SARS-CoV 3CLpro contains one tryptophan residue (Trp31) at the catalytic domain. Its backbone lines up at the entrance of the active site. Therefore, its fluorescence change can reflect environmental variation of the active site. The catalytic domain of SARSCoV 3CLpro used in this study displays a fluorescence peak at 340 nm after the tryptophan excitation wavelength of 290 nm. We monitored the change of the fluorescence intensities depending on the presence or absence of all flavonoids. Since each compound in the flavonoid library was almost non-fluorescent under",
            "results for herbacetin (\u20139.263), rhoifolin (\u20139.565) and pectolinarin (\u20138.054) were selected and hypothesised to be biological complexes. To find reasonable structural factors endowing the good affinity of herbacetin, the poses of kaempferol (\u20138.526) and morin (\u20138.930), two closest homologues, were also calculated and compared. The predicted complex structures and 2D schematic representations of them are illustrated in Figure 4.",
            "the experiment condition, a change of fluorescence intensity reflects interactions between the catalytic domain and chemicals. Intriguingly, the three inhibitory compounds obviously reduced the fluorescence intensity of the catalytic domain compared with others (Figure 3). The decreased emission intensity confirmed the complex formation between the catalytic domain and inhibitory compounds.",
            "In order to deduce the binding modes of the inhibitory flavonoids in the molecular level, an in-depth theoretical investigation through an induced-fit docking study was carried out. The interactions between SARS-CoV 3CLpro and three inhibitory flavonoids were analysed to predict their binding affinities.

        "Discussion": [
            "Flavonoids are an important kind of natural products. In particular, they belong to a type of plant secondary metabolites with a polyphenolic structure widely found in fruits and vegetables. They have miscellaneous reciprocal biochemical and antioxidant effects associated with various diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and atherosclerosis[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. It is due to antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagens and anti-cancer-causing properties combined with the ability to control major cell enzyme functions[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Intriguingly, some flavonoids also have antiviral activity[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Specifically, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, amentoflavone[28], quercetin, daidzein, puerarin, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate[29] and kaempferol[30] were reported to inhibit the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Therefore, the antiviral effect is presumed to be directly linked to suppress the activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in some cases. However, the systematic analysis using various scaffolds of flavonoids was not reported. In order to find the best scaffold to inhibit the function of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, an assay with various flavonoid derivatives classified in 10 scaffolds was built and performed. Among them, the best compounds were one flavonol, herbacetin and two flavones, rhoifolin and pectolinarin. In the current assay method including 0.01% Triton X-100, the three flavonoids showed the better inhibitory activity than the previously reported flavonoids as mentioned above[28\u201330]. The aggregating tendency of flavonoids frequently leads to obtain false bioassay results and can be avoided by adding 0.01% Triton X-10024. It is worthwhile to note that amentoflavone, the most effective flavonoid inhibiting SARS-CoV 3CLpro[28], did not effectively function in the presence of 0.01% Triton X-100 (Figure 5).",
            "To elucidate the relationship between binding mode and binding affinity, a docking study for herbacetin homologues, kaempferol and morin, were also performed. The glide scores of three compounds were \u20139.263, \u20138.526 and \u20138.930, respectively. The tendency of the glide scores is matched with the binding affinity of the compounds. The comparison of the predicted binding modes",
            "of three complex structures showed critical factors governing their S1 site of SARS-CoV through a hydrogen bond with Glu[166]. In binding affinity. In common, they share the kaempferol motif. As contrast, the chromen-4-one scaffold of kaempferol locates in the shown in Figure 4, the phenyl moiety of kaempferol occupies the S2 site. In herbacetin, total of four hydrogen bonds are formed",
            "Using the library, a number of flavonoids with a wide range of inhibitory activity were detected. Intriguingly, inhibitory activities of some flavonoids were turned out to be artificial when triton X100 was treated. Herbacetin, rhoifolin and pectolinarin were the best inhibitory compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro in the flavonoid library. The binding of the flavonoids was independently demonstrated by a tryptophan-based fluorescence method. In order to predict the flavonoid scaffolds needed to interact with the catalytic site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, an induced-fit docking study was performed and analysed. The presence of additional 8hydroxyl group of herbacetin was expected to be critical to acquire its high binding affinity around the S1 and S2 sites. The occupation of the S1 and S2 sites by carbohydrate groups of rhoifolin and pectolinarin was anticipated to be another way of getting high affinity to SARS-CoV 3CLpro in glycosylated flavonoids. This study suggests that the biochemical assay combined with the docking prediction may be useful to develop better inhibitory flavonoid derivatives from various flavonoid scaffolds.",
            "within a distance of 2.33 \u00c5 in the S2 site. Especially, the major binding force was driven by the presence of the additional 8hydroxyl group which plays a critical role in binding with Glu[166] and Gln[189]. These bindings are predicted to confer a good glide score of herbacetin. In contrast, the binding modes of morin and kaemperol become different due to the absence of above two hydrogen bonds due the lack of the 8-hydroxyl group (Figure 4). The absence also induces the change nullifying the hydrogen bond formed by the 5-hydroxyl group of the chromen-4-one scaffold with Asp[187] observed in herbacetin. Though there is a new hydrogen bond formed through the 3-hydroxyl group, it may not enough to overcome the loss of binding capacity induced by the 8-hydroxyl group. This survey shows the importance of the 8hydroxyl group at the strong binding affinity of herbacetin.",
            "The glide scores of rhoifolin and pectolinarin were \u20139.565 and \u20138.054, respectively. They belong to the flavone family. Interestingly, their binding modes are different from those of the above three flavonols. Rhoifolin and pectolinarin possess a-L-rhamnopyranosyl b-D-glucopyranoside and L-mannopyranosyl b-D-glucopyranoside, respectively. The additional bulky carbohydrate groups are attached to 7-position of the chromen-4-one scaffold. As a result, the hydrogen bond formed between the 7-hydroxyl group and the backbone of Ile[188] was abolished. In addition, the bulky groups require a large space to reside in. Therefore, these carbohydrate groups occupy the S1 and S2 sites and the chromen-4-one moieties locate in the S2 and S30 sites, unlike the above three flavonols. The better affinity of rhoifolin may be due to orchestrated binding through S1, S2 and S3\u2019 sites.",
            "The assay and docking result indicates important conclusions. At first, flavonoids have a wide range of binding affinity to SARSCoV CLpro due to their hydrophobic aromatic rings and hydrophilic hydroxyl groups. Second, the presence of carbohydrate groups influences severely to the binding affinity and mode of the chromen-4-one moiety. Third, Triton X-100 is critical to reduce false-positives and overestimates. Based on the result, the strategy to cope with SARS targeting SARS-CoV 3CLpro can be newly designed. A further study is going on to make derivatives which lead to better inhibitory compounds based on this study."
