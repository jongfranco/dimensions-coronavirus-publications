An amino acid substitution of spike (S) protein is defined as an absolutely conserved site in the batand pangolin-origin coronaviruses but different from that of SARS-CoV-2. Structural analysis of S protein of novel coronaviruses was modelled using the Swiss-Model program with that of the S protein of SARS-CoV structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2DD8) as a template. The red and blue regions indicate the spike protein 1 and spike protein 2, respectively. The blue region indicates the receptor binding region. The correspondencing amino acids to the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the S protein were mapped using MacPymol (http://www.pymol.org/)"
