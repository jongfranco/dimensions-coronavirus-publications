        "abstract": "In the past few decades, coronaviruses have risen as a global threat to public health. Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from Wuhan caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19. However, there are agents that were used during the SARS and MERS epidemics. We could learn from SARS and MERS. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus. In this review, we discuss the literature on the efficacy of LPV in vitro and in vivo, especially in",

            "Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for any human CoV infection. Upon the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, patients were administered off-label antivirals. Most in vitro studies have shown that SARS-CoV could be inhibited by LPV and that the EC50 of LPV is acceptable. Furthermore, two retrospective matched cohort studies of SARS patients revealed that LPV/r plays an essential role in the clinical outcome, especially in the early stage. LPV/r-treatment alone or in combination with interferon had improved clinical outcomes in experiments involving common marmosets and in some MERS patient. However, we need to wait for more clinically valid evidence to confirmed the positive value of LPV for COVID-19 treatment."

            "In the past few decades, coronaviruses have risen as a global threat to public health. Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from Wuhan caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19. However, there are agents that were used during the SARS and MERS epidemics. We could learn from SARS and MERS. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus. In this review, we discuss the literature on the efficacy of LPV in vitro and in vivo, especially in patients with SARS and MERS, so that we might clarify the potential for the use of LPV in patients with COVID-19.",

            "For the MERS-CoV mouse model, prophylactic LPV/r combined with IFN\u03b2 slightly reduced the viral loads.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] However, therapeutic LPV/r and IFN\u03b2 improved pulmonary function, but failed to reduce viral replication and lung hemorrhaging. This in vivo evidence is suggestive of the potential for LPV/r to treat MERS-CoV infections. When LPV/r was combined with IFN\u03b2, the antiviral activity (EC50 = 160 IU/ml) was indistinguishable from that of IFN\u03b2 alone (EC50 = 175 IU/ml, P = 0.62). This suggests that the observed in vitro antiviral activity of the LPV/rIFN\u03b2 combination against MERS-CoV is dominated by IFN\u03b2 when LPV/r is used at clinically relevant concentrations.",

            "In a preliminary report, there were no deaths at 30 days after the onset of symptoms among 34 patients treated with LPV/r (400 mg ritonavir and 100 mg lopinavir) in combination with ribavirin initially, compared to 10% mortality in 690 patients taking only ribavirin. Twenty-one percent of 33 patients who received LPV/r as a rescue therapy died, whereas 42% of 77 patients who received ribavirin alone died.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] However, these results were given only as a presentation, and no formal paper was published. Thus, the evidence is not credible.",
            "pulsed methylprednisolone were decreased. These SARS patients were retrospectively matched with control subject. Matching was performed with respect to age, sex, the presence of comorbidities, lactate dehydrogenase level, and the use of pulsed steroid therapy. However, the mortality, oxygen desaturation and intubation rates of the subgroup of patients who received lopinavir-ritonavir as rescue therapy were not different from those in the matched cohort and patients who received an increased dose of pulsed methylprednisolone. This result suggests that the combination of lopinavir and ribavirin has a synergistic effect for the treatment of SARS; it may play an essential role in the early phase of the infection. The viral replication phase peaks around day 10.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] LPV/r use within this replication window decreases the peak viral load and the subsequent immune response.",
            "Another retrospective matched cohort study of SARS patient also revealed that the rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death was significantly lower in the LPV/r combination treatment group (1/41, 2.4%) than the historical controls (32/111, 28.8%) on day 21.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] In addition, the LPV/r group had a progressive decrease in the viral load, an early rise in the lymphocyte count, a reduction in the cumulative dose of pulsed methylprednisolone, and fewer episodes of nosocomial infections. These findings show that LPV/r, when combined with ribavirin, may be an effective agent against SARS. The summary of the effects of LPV in SARS patients is shown in Table 2.",
            "A MERS patient who received LPV/r, ribavirin and interferon had a resolution of viremia after 2 days of treatment.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] However, the patient eventually died from septic shock 2 months and 19 days after the initial diagnosis. Another 64-year-old MERS patient from Korea was also treated with LPV/r, ribavirin and interferon. After 6 days of antiviral therapy, negative PCR result in the serum sample, sputum samples and swab samples were achieved.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] The patient was discharged on day 13 of admission after achieving complete recovery. These two simple cases may show that LPV is effective against MERS. However, they do not exclude the possibility of other combination therapies being effective or spontaneous improvement occurring. The treatment effect of LPV/r against MERS is still controversial.",
            "A retrospective study enrolled healthcare workers (HCWs) with high-risk exposure to MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia and revealed that an effective postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategy including LPV/r may limit the spread of infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] PEP therapy was associated with a 40% decrease in the risk of infection with no severe adverse events during treatment. PEP therapy was a significant factor that reduced the risk of MERS-CoV infection in HCWs. This finding may indirectly reflect the antiviral effect of LPV/r. Moreover, a combination regimen of interferon + ribavirin + LPV/r was recommended officially for MERS therapy in Korea, where MERS began to spread in 2015.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Without randomized controlled trials, determining treatment is difficult due to patient and treatment variability as well as a lack of appropriately matched controls. The combination of LPV/r and interferon was considered in a randomized control trial in Saudi Arabia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] Enrollment began in November 2016 and the results are not yet available.

The efficacy of LPV/r antiviral treatment warrants further verification in future studies. Nine randomized controlled trials of LPV/r in patients with COVID-19 have been registered in China up to February 22 (Table 4). Currently, the combination of LPV/r is a recommended antiviral regimen in the latest version of the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China."

            "Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for any human CoV infection. Upon the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, patients were administered off-label antivirals. Most in vitro studies have shown that SARS-CoV could be inhibited by LPV and that the EC50 of LPV is acceptable. Furthermore, two retrospective matched cohort studies of SARS patients revealed that LPV/r plays an essential role in the clinical outcome, especially in the early stage. LPV/r-treatment alone or in combination with interferon had improved clinical outcomes in experiments involving common marmosets and in some MERS patient. However, we need to wait for more clinically valid evidence to confirmed the positive value of LPV for COVID-19 treatment.",
            "Although most of the data indicate the efficacy of LPV, adverse reactions should be kept in mind. Diarrhea, nausea and asthenia are the most frequently reported reactions in patients receiving LPV therapy.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] Elevated total bilirubin, triglyceride and hepatic enzyme levels have also been reported.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] A retrospective study of MERS showed that the most common symptoms and laboratory tests of LPV/r PEP were diarrhea (40.9%), nausea (40.9%), stomatitis (18.2%), fever (13.6%), anemia (45.0%), leukopenia (40.0%) and hyperbilirubinemia (100%).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] However, the symptoms and laboratory tests returned to normal after LPV therapy ceased.",
            "The protease inhibitor LPV could be an effective treatment based on experience accumulated from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. The treatment of CoV patients with LPV/r improved their outcomes. LPV/r may be a potential treatment option for COVID-19. Additional studies are needed to gain further insights into the origin, tropism, and pathogenesis of COVID-19.",
