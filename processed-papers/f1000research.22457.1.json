        "abstract": "We prepared the three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 (aka 2019-nCoV) 3C-like protease (3CLpro) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96% identity) ortholog from the SARS-CoV. All residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. \u00a0With the 3CLpro molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache.\u00a0 The drugs Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes.",

            "We identified five trials on ClinicalTrials.gov involving antiviral and immunomodulatory drug treatments for SARS (Table 5), all without reported results; i.e., at present, there are no safe and effective drug candidates against SARS-CoV. This is because once the epidemic is over, there are no patients to recruit for clinical trials. Only the study with streptokinase succeeded in completion of phase 3. It is disappointing that little progress in SARS drug development has been made in the past 17 years. After the 2003 outbreak, numerous inhibitors for the 3CLpro enzyme have been proposed[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], yet no new drug candidates have succeeded to enter the clinical phase 1.<br/><br/>One record which receives a lot of attention amid the current outbreak is the lopinavir/ritonavir combination[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. They are protease inhibitors originally developed against HIV. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, despite lacking a clinical trial, they were tried as an emergency measure and found to offer improved clinical outcome[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. However, some scientists did express scepticism[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. By analogy, these compounds were speculated to act on SARS-CoV 3CLpro specifically, but there is as yet no crystal structure to support that, although docking studies were carried out to propose various binding modes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. The IC50 value of lopinavir is 50 \u03bcM (Ki = 14 \u03bcM) and that for ritonavir cannot be established[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Although this is far from a cure, based on our results that the two CoV 3CLpro enzymes are identical as far as protein sequences and substrate specificities are concerned, we are of the opinion that this is still one of the recommended routes for immediate treatment at the time of writing (early February 2020)."

            "The viral genome encodes more than 20 proteins, among which are two proteases (PLpro and 3CLpro) that are vital to virus replication; they cleave the two translated polyproteins (PP1A and PP1AB) into individual functional components. The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro, aka main protease, Mpro) is considered to be a promising drug target. Tremendous effort has been spent on studying this protein in order to identify therapeutics against the SARS-CoV in particular and other pathogenic coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in general because they share similar active sites and enzymatic mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to build a molecular model of the 3CLpro of the SARS-CoV-2 and to carry out virtual screening to identify readily usable therapeutics. It was not our intention, however, to comment on other structure-based drug design research as these will not be timely for the current epidemic."

            "Virtual screening for readily available drugs When examined in molecular graphics[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], all solutions were found to fit into their respective active sites convincingly. The binding energies of chain A complexes were generally higher than those of chain B by approximately 1.4 kcal mol-1 (Table 3). This presumably demonstrates the intrinsic conformational variability between the A- and B-chain active sites in the crystal structure (the average root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) in C\u03b1 atomic positions of active-site residues is 0.83 \u00c5). In each screen, the differences in binding energies are small, suggesting that the ranking is not discriminatory, and all top scorers should be examined. We combined the two screens and found 16 candidates which give promising binding models (etoposide and its phosphate counted as one) (Table 3).",
            "Assessment of the candidate drugs We checked the actions, targets and side effects of the 16 candidates. Among these, we first noticed velpatasvir (Figure 1A, D) and ledipasvir, which are inhibitors of the NS5A protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both are marketed as approved drugs in combination with sofosbuvir, which is a prodrug nucleotide analogue inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, or NS5B). Interestingly, sofosbuvir has recently been proposed as an antiviral for the SARS-CoV-2 based on the similarity between the replication mechanisms of the HCV and the coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Our results further strengthen that these dual-component HCV drugs, Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), may be attractive candidates to repurpose because they may inhibit two coronaviral enzymes.

The approved drug venetoclax (Figure 1C) and investigational drugs MK-3207 and R428 scored well in both screens.

        "Discussion": [
            "We identified five trials on ClinicalTrials.gov involving antiviral and immunomodulatory drug treatments for SARS (Table 5), all without reported results; i.e., at present, there are no safe and effective drug candidates against SARS-CoV. This is because once the epidemic is over, there are no patients to recruit for clinical trials. Only the study with streptokinase succeeded in completion of phase 3. It is disappointing that little progress in SARS drug development has been made in the past 17 years. After the 2003 outbreak, numerous inhibitors for the 3CLpro enzyme have been proposed[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], yet no new drug candidates have succeeded to enter the clinical phase 1.",
            "One record which receives a lot of attention amid the current outbreak is the lopinavir/ritonavir combination[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. They are protease inhibitors originally developed against HIV. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, despite lacking a clinical trial, they were tried as an emergency measure and found to offer improved clinical outcome[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. However, some scientists did express scepticism[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. By analogy, these compounds were speculated to act on SARS-CoV 3CLpro specifically, but there is as yet no crystal structure to support that, although docking studies were carried out to propose various binding modes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. The IC50 value of lopinavir is 50 \u03bcM (Ki = 14 \u03bcM) and that for ritonavir cannot be established[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. Although this is far from a cure, based on our results that the two CoV 3CLpro enzymes are identical as far as protein sequences and substrate specificities are concerned, we are of the opinion that this is still one of the recommended routes for immediate treatment at the time of writing (early February 2020).",
            "If we look beyond the 3CLpro, an earlier screen produced 27 candidates that could be repurposed against both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV25. In addition, the other coronaviral proteins could be targeted for screening. Treatment of the COVID-19 with remdesivir (a repurposed drug in development targeting the RdRp) showing improved clinical outcome has just been reported and clinical trial is now underway[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].",
