            "As the world watches the rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, it is important to reflect on the lessons that can be learned from this and previous emerging zoonotic viruses (EZV) in a comparative and analytic way. Although the source of 2019-nCoV is yet to be confirmed, early findings suggest a high possibility of a bat origin.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] There have been six major EZV outbreaks in the past 25 years caused by proven or suspected bat-borne viruses (table).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] With these in mind, four major points are worth considering in the context of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.",

Clear national and international guidelines are needed on how to achieve the right balance in the leadership provided by public health and research experts facing an outbreak of an EZV.",
            "Third, a One Health approach[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] in EZV outbreak responses and control is vital. In August, 2003, after WHO declared the end of the SARS outbreak, it organised a special mission with international and Chinese scientists to investigate the origin and early transmission events of SARS-CoV. Among the eight international experts invited, seven were veterinarians or those working in animal health. By contrast, the six-member Chinese team only had one participating veterinarian or animal scientist. While recognising the tremendous effort by the China CDC team in the early response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the small number of team members trained in animal health was probably one of the reasons for the delay in identifying an intermediate animal(s), which is likely to have caused the spread of the virus in a region of the market where wildlife animals were traded and subsequently found to be heavily contaminated. Unfortunately, what animal(s) was involved in trans\u00ad mission remains unknown. There is an urgent need to know the risks associated with the presumed animal to human transmission of 2019-nCoV, and the measures that can be taken to prevent such transmission in the future. For example, should the sale of wild animals be restricted in Chinese wet markets? We recommend that a comprehensive One Health team be involved in all future EZV investigations. Indeed, this approach has international implications, with risks of exotic zoonotic diseases associated with the huge quantities of illegal bush meat from central and west Africa being imported into Europe and North America.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]",
            "Finally, naming of a new virus is important not only for virologists in the long term but also for effective communication to the general public. In all the major EZV events over the past 25 years, naming of the new virus has not been straightforward and most went through a renaming process (table). This is also true for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. There has been intensive discussion now among virologists worldwide about an alternative name for 2019-nCoV. To continue the tradition of using a syndrome, as in SARS and MERS, and to avoid the sensitivity of using a city name, we propose to name this new virus Han acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (HARS-CoV). Han is the abbreviation of Wuhan in",
            "Chinese. Such a name is, we believe, preferable to the names being used in media headlines, such as \u201cWuhan virus\u201d or \u201cChina virus\u201d, and it retains the historical fact that the outbreak started in Wuhan.",
            "Now is not a time for blame. Rather, there are lessons the global health community can and should learn and act on so that we can better respond to the next EZV event, which is almost certain to happen again. These lessons are definitely not unique to China.",
