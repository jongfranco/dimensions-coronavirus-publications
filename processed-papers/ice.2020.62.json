            "Current situation in Hangzhou Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province in China, was confronted with the pandemic of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that originated in Wuhan, Hubei province[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. According to the Health Commission of Zhejiang Province[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>], six cases was first reported on January 19, 2020, and the cumulative cases reached 169 as of February 20, 2020. The situation in Hangzhou was once rather severe as it was once the top ranking city with respect to number of confirmed cases in Zhejiang province at the beginning of the epidemic. Since Hangzhou government took rigorous measures to contain the epidemic, positive trends have been seen. The daily number of newly confirmed cases has sharply decreased within the last week and there was only one confirmed case from February 17 to 20. Similarly, another point to be emphasized was that Hangzhou reported no deaths in its administrative region. We used a regression of log-incidence over time model3,which could provide a fitted trajectory for the actual daily incidence to verify the control effect. As show in Fig.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], the optimal splitting point, which was defined as the peak in number of daily new cases simulated by the model, occurred on January 25. That date was just about a week after launching the highest level of emergency public health alert and response in Hangzhou, which indicates that the prevention and control measures may be effective. Measures to control and prevent pandemic of COVID-19 in Hangzhou",
            "First, aware of the seriousness of the situation, Zhejiang province first launched a Level-I Public Health Incident Alert, the highest level of emergency public health alerts and responses in the nation's public health management system on January 23, 2020. As the top level of China's public health alert system, this measure could maximally limit the extent of movement by people. Second, further action was taken on February 3, 2020. Most districts of Hangzhou announced in a statement that every community would be kept under closed management, and only one family member was allowed to leave his house and buy daily living supplies outdoors every two days. Furthermore, \"non-contact delivery\", a new delivery method, was adopted by many express delivery companies, which could reduce contagion risk. Fourth, in order to reduce the concentration of personnel to avoid the risk of cross-infection, online working and network teaching were encouraged for workers and students, respectively, which were supported by mobile technology companies. Fifth, to meet the need of resumption of production and curb the transmission of the virus as far as possible, Hangzhou arranged chartered transportation to help numbers of migrants return to workplaces. Lastly, in cooperation with Alipay, Hangzhou adopted the health QR code system on February 11, 2020, which were designated by green, yellow or red. People who wanted to get into Hangzhou needed to submit their travel history and health information online in advance. Residents with a green code indicated they had a low current risk of being infected, while residents with yellow or red codes were quarantined for seven or fourteen days and required to report their health condition every day to exclude infection before the codes turned green. This health surveillance system has now been applied in most cities in Zhejiang province and then will be promoted to other provinces."
