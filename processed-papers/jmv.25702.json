            "Initially, it was thought that the infection showed no or limited human\u2010to\u2010human transmission. However, soon after it became evident that transmission among humans constitutes the main mechanism of infection spread, in community, health care facilities, and at home. The diagnoses were made purely based on clinical and radiographical grounds, lack of response to antibiotic therapy, and exclusion of other common respiratory infections for the season.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>\u2010<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] With the newly identified genetic sequence information, diagnostic tests based on detection of the viral sequence by reverse\u2010 transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) or next\u2010generation sequencing platforms soon became available. This allowed for diagnosis confirmation and better estimates of infection activity, which was found to be increasing at alarming speeds. The municipal government issued a public warning and implemented a total shutdown of transportation on 23 January 2020, advising individual isolation.",
            "On 30 January 2020, a World Health Organization panel declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. As of 31 January 2020, the confirmed cases reached 9811 nationwide, and 15 238 suspected cases (Figure 2)."

        "Initially, it was thought that the infection showed no or limited human\u2010to\u2010human transmission",
        "Since 25 January tests have become increasingly available for clinically suspected patients, with a history of exposure, fever, and positive findings on chest computerized tomography",
        "With the regular 96\u2010well microplate, and automatic enzyme\u2010linked immunoassay devices, the test capacity is greatly increased compared to RNA\u2010based molecular tests and can handle a large number of febrile patients such as in the current epidemic, with a quick turnaround time (2\u20103 hours)",
        "Serologic tests can be implemented in the clinical laboratory of any hospital, with a much wider application than molecular tests. Another issue for consideration is reporting of asymptomatically infected cases, or very mild cases of infection who are a large group of patients but not tested for viral RNA, making the true rate of infection in the population unknown",
        "With the development of a specific IgG antibody test, a large\u2010scale sero\u2010epidemiological study can be conducted after the end of the current outbreak, so that we can understand the true scale of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of the novel coronavirus of 2019"
