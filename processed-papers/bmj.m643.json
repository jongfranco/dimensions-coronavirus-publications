            "Doctors, patients, and volunteer nurses make for the most captivating, if tragic, of the stories online. On the night that the whistleblower ophthalmologist Li Wenliang died, Katharina Qi, a policy adviser based in Beijing, read and shared people\u2019s stories online. Weibo users claimed to know Li\u2019s family and said that he was being rescued, hours after his heart had stopped. Some wrote that his family were also infected, including his pregnant wife in hospital. In reality, his parents had recovered, his wife was not infected, and the suppression of facts regarding his death left Qi and other internet users deeply disillusioned.",
            "WHO advice on coronaviruses (See: https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)",

            "\u2022 Taking self-medication such as antibiotics.",
            "Weibo has also tried to curtail unverified prevention advice with infographics explaining that, \u201cNo, smoking cannot prevent infection,\u201d \u201cPutting the air conditioning on high isn\u2019t going to keep you safe,\u201d and, \u201cThere is no need to overdose on garlic or sesame oil\u201d\u2014commonly known to be good for the immune system.",
            "But it can be hard to know what to believe when you can\u2019t trust the official news. And, in Chinese medical advertising, anything goes. One herbal potion, Shuang-Huang-Lian, has sold out all over the country. Shelley Ochs, a traditional Chinese medicine educator raised in the US and trained in Beijing, told The BMJ that promoting Shuang-Huang-Lian did not ring true from a medical standpoint. In fact, the nature of the illness caused by covid-19 means that this remedy may be counterproductive. \u201cThrowing cold and bitter herbs at the body could actually drive the \u2018external pathogens\u2019 deeper and make recovery both longer and more difficult,\u201d said Ochs.",
            "road from laboratory findings to animal testing to human clinical trials is a long one.\u201d",
            "The device market is also heating up. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist advising the government on its response to covid-19, was alarmed by the number of diagnostic gizmos shown to him by salespeople on his latest visit in early February. This was something he had not seen in other outbreaks, he told Beijing based foreign correspondents in a call on 9 February, from self-quarantine in the US.",
            "It\u2019s ironic that covid-19\u2019s crossover to humans in December is likely to have taken place at a market known for selling seafood and exotic animals used at the more mystical end of traditional Chinese health practices\u2014virility, longevity, immunity. For now, the sale of exotic ingredients has been banned, and, as Lipkin remarked, this outbreak will probably be the \u201cnail in the coffin for the sale of wild animals in China.\u201d Meanwhile, people are waiting impatiently for evidence based responses from both traditional and Western medicine, which could take months or years.",
