The recent reforms in the South Korean civil service have emphasized the competencies and performance of civil servants, reinforced the link between performance and reward, highlighted a result-oriented organizational culture, and promoted equity and integration for all social groups. Although the civil service reforms have brought remarkable changes, the South Korean civil service still faces a number of obstacles including bureaucratic resistance and political challenges. For sustainable improvement, civil service reform requires a long-term commitment to significant changes in institutional arrangement, organizational culture, and the attitudes of civil servants.",
