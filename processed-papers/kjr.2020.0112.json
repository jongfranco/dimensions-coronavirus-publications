In this study, we present serial CT findings in a 40-year-old female patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with the symptoms of fever, chest tightness, and fatigue. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. CT showed rapidly progressing peripheral consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs. After treatment, the lesions were shown to be almost absorbed leaving the fibrous lesions.

Chest CT showed rapidly developing multiple patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs, which were mainly distributed in the peripheral areas. In the later stage, there may be a possibility of development of fibrosis. And with high-resolution CT, it will be easier to find GGOs in the early stage.

The patient was physically healthy before and had no underlying diseases. She did not travel to Wuhan city and denied any contact with patients with COVID-19 infection.",
            "At admission, her body temperature was elevated to 38.9\u00b0C. Laboratory examinations showed normal leukocyte (4170/\u03bcL), neutrophils (59.6%), and lymphocytes (30.9%). There was an increase in hematocrit (0.456) and glucose (7.3 mmol/L) levels. The initial chest radiograph, taken 3-days after fever onset, was normal in both lungs (Fig. 1A). On the same day, unenhanced chest CT showed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in the subpleural area of the right lower lobe (Fig. 1B), and the left lung was normal. She was given antibiotics for symptomatic treatment.",
            "At first, the patient did not show any respiratory symptoms, however, on day 6 after fever onset, she began coughing. A follow-up chest CT revealed an increased density of GGOs in the right lower lobe, which then progressed into consolidations with perilobular thickening. Moreover, multifocal peripheral patchy areas of nodular consolidations and GGO lesions were newly developed in the subpleural areas of the both lower lobes (Fig. 1C-E). Laboratory",

Axial CT scan (B) shows GGOs in subpleural area of right lower lobe. Left lung is normal. C-E. Follow-up chest CT scans taken 6 days after onset of fever show increased density of GGOs in right lower lobe, which then progressed into consolidations with perilobular thickening.

After 6 days of treatment, the temperature of the patient dropped to normal and the symptoms disappeared. On day 12, a repeat rRT-PCR was negative and the patient was discharged.

Therefore, routine CT examination is recommended for the patients suspected of COVID-19 to reduce missed diagnosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. CT findings of this patient include the short-term progression of lesions, multiple patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs, especially in the peripheral lung zones of the lower lobes, which may represent alveolar injury, cellular and fibrous exudation. After treatment, the consolidations and GGOs were almost absorbed, leaving fibrous cord-like shadows that represent fibrosis.",
