        "abstract": "The etiology of Porcine respiratory disease complex is complicated by infections with multiple pathogens, and multiple infections increase the difficulty in identifying the causal pathogen. In this present study, we developed a detection system of microbes from porcine respiratory by using TaqMan real-time PCR (referred to as Dempo-PCR) to screen a broad range of pathogens associated with porcine respiratory diseases in a single run. We selected 17 porcine respiratory pathogens (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Boldetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella multocida toxin, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma hyosynovie, porcine circovirus 2, pseudorabies virus, porcine cytomegalovirus, swine influenza A virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, EU strain, porcine respiratory coronavirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) as detection targets and designed novel specific primer-probe sets for seven of them. In sensitivity test by using standard curves from synthesized DNA, all primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. However, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus is known to have a high frequency of genetic mutations, and the primer and probe sequences will need to be checked at a considerable frequency when performing Dempo-PCR from field samples. A total of 30 lung samples from swine showing respiratory symptoms on six farms were tested by the Dempo-PCR to validate the assay\u2019s clinical performance. As the results, 12 pathogens (5 virus and 7 bacteria) were detected and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Haemophilus parasuis, and porcine cytomegalovirus were detected at high frequency. These results suggest that Dempo-PCR assay can be applied as a screening system with wide detection targets.",

The LOD, based on DNA copy number, was \u2264100 copies/reaction for all primer-probe sets. The CVs were at most 2.62%; this reproducibility was observed with PRCV testing. In addition, the calibration curves of all assays covered a linear dynamic range of more than five orders of magnitude and showed R2 values of at least 0.9922. Although the PCR efficiency for PRRSV US strain and PRV was slightly low (81.6% and 88.6%, respectively), the PCR efficiency in all detection assays was more than 80%, which was enough to quantify the target copy number."

        "discussion": [
            "PRDC is one of the most important health concerns for pig producers and involves multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. PRDC is multifactorial, with both infectious and non-infectious factors contributing to respiratory disease seen in pigs between the ages of 3 and 6 months. The interaction of viral and bacterial pathogens, environmental factors, pig-specific factors and management conditions all contribute to the development and impact the severity of PRDC [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. The most commonly isolated pathogens are PRRSV, SIV, PCV2, and M. hyopneumoniae. The other pathogens associated with PRDC are S. suis, A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida, P. multocida toxin, B. bronchiseptica, H. parasuis, M. hyorhinis, M. hyosynovie, PRV, PRCV, PCMV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. However, no single-reaction diagnostic test currently exists for the simultaneous detection of major pathogens commonly associated with PRDC. Routine diagnostic methods for detection of viruses implicated in PRDC include virus isolation in cell culture, antigen detection by direct fluorescent antibody staining, and enzyme immunoassay [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and culture-based methods for bacteria [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. These methods are time-consuming and require independent tests for each pathogen. Furthermore, the detection of bacterial pathogens typically depends on culture-based methods that can take several days to obtain results. Due to their high sensitivity and ease of use, PCR and real-time PCR tests have been developed for several agents implicated in the PRDC; however, these tests typically target single pathogens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. A multiplex PCR assay capable of detecting five porcine viruses including two porcine respiratory viruses was developed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. However, to date, there are no diagnostic tests capable of simultaneous detection of multiple major viral and bacterial porcine respiratory pathogens in a single reaction."

            "The etiology of Porcine respiratory disease complex is complicated by infections with multiple pathogens, and multiple infections increase the difficulty in identifying the causal pathogen. In this present study, we developed a detection system of microbes from porcine respiratory by using TaqMan real-time PCR (referred to as Dempo-PCR) to screen a broad range of pathogens associated with porcine respiratory diseases in a single run. We selected 17 porcine respiratory pathogens (Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Boldetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella multocida toxin, Streptococcus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Mycoplasma hyosynovie, porcine circovirus 2, pseudorabies virus, porcine cytomegalovirus, swine influenza A virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, EU strain, porcine respiratory coronavirus and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) as detection targets and designed novel specific primer-probe sets for seven of them. In sensitivity test by using standard curves from synthesized DNA, all primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. However, porcine reproductive and respiratory virus is known to have a high frequency of genetic mutations, and the primer and probe sequences will need to be checked at a considerable frequency when performing Dempo-PCR from field samples. A total of 30 lung samples from swine showing respiratory symptoms on six farms were tested by the Dempo-PCR to validate the assay\u2019s clinical performance. As the results, 12 pathogens (5 virus and 7 bacteria) were detected and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus US strain, Mycoplasma hyorhinis, Haemophilus parasuis, and porcine cytomegalovirus were detected at high frequency. These results suggest that Dempo-PCR assay can be applied as a screening system with wide detection targets.",

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "PRDC is one of the most important health concerns for pig producers and involves multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. PRDC is multifactorial, with both infectious and non-infectious factors contributing to respiratory disease seen in pigs between the ages of 3 and 6 months. The interaction of viral and bacterial pathogens, environmental factors, pig-specific factors and management conditions all contribute to the development and impact the severity of PRDC [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. The most commonly isolated pathogens are PRRSV, SIV, PCV2, and M. hyopneumoniae. The other pathogens associated with PRDC are S. suis, A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida, P. multocida toxin, B. bronchiseptica, H. parasuis, M. hyorhinis, M. hyosynovie, PRV, PRCV, PCMV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. However, no single-reaction diagnostic test currently exists for the simultaneous detection of major pathogens commonly associated with PRDC. Routine diagnostic methods for detection of viruses implicated in PRDC include virus isolation in cell culture, antigen detection by direct fluorescent antibody staining, and enzyme immunoassay [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] and culture-based methods for bacteria [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. These methods are time-consuming and require independent tests for each pathogen. Furthermore, the detection of bacterial pathogens typically depends on culture-based methods that can take several days to obtain results. Due to their high sensitivity and ease of use, PCR and real-time PCR tests have been developed for several agents implicated in the PRDC; however, these tests typically target single pathogens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. A multiplex PCR assay capable of detecting five porcine viruses including two porcine respiratory viruses was developed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. However, to date, there are no diagnostic tests capable of simultaneous detection of multiple major viral and bacterial porcine respiratory pathogens in a single reaction.",
            "Recently Lung et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]reported a novel prototype automated microarray that integrates and automates all steps of post-PCR microarray processing for the simultaneous detection and typing of four bacteria (M. hyopneumoniae, P. multocida, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. suis) and four viruses (PRRSV, SIV, PCV2, PRCV) differentiation of the two PRRSV genotypes and pathogenic versus non-pathogenic P. multocida strains. This electronic microarray assay can be completed in less than 4 hr with little user handling plus approximately 1.5 hr for the RT-PCR. These methods are highly specific and sensitive, and easy to operate, but these are expensive to run and requires expensive equipment. On the other hand, Dempo-PCR assay can be completed in less than 3 hr, and easy operate.",
            "In this study, Dempo-PCR has been developed, following the methods of diagnosis of bovine diarrhea developed by Tsuchiaka et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Since all primer-probe sets were optimized in the same temperature conditions, Dempo-PCR can detect a total of 17 pathogens, including 8 viruses, 8 bacteria, and 1 toxin, in a single run of TaqMan real-time PCR. In sensitivity test by using standard curves from synthesized DNA, all primer-probe sets showed high sensitivity. Furthermore, the results of detection of target pathogens from clinical samples using this method showed similar results to the respective conventional PCR method. However, PRRS virus is known to have a high frequency of genetic mutations, and the primer and probe sequences will need to be checked at a considerable frequency when performing Dempo-PCR from field samples. The type of pathogens involved in PRDC is specific to the regions and countries where production occurs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Therefore, it may be necessary to change the inspect pathogens according to the regions. However, Dempo-PCR is possible to detect many types of pathogens simultaneously.",
            "By Dempo-PCR assay, multiple PRDC pathogens can be detected comprehensively and simultaneously. This assay can quickly elucidate existence of pathogens in a sample. In this study, Multiple viral and bacterial porcine respiratory pathogens were detected doi: 10.1292/jvms.19-0063",
            "from pigs of all farms examined. Especially, five bacteria pathogens (A. pleuropneumoniae, B. bronchiseptica, P. multocida, M. hyopneumoniae, M. hyorhinis) and four viruses (PCV2, PCMV, PRRS US strain, PRCV) were detected on pigs of farm F. In this study, PCMV was detected in high proportion from pigs of all farms, and mixed infection with multiple pathogens was observed. PCMV has been documented worldwide, and shows high infection rates on pig farms in Japan, Europe, North America, and China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. Hansen et al, reported that a significant association between PCMV and PCV2 was only found in the cases of PRDC, and the role of PCMV in PRDC needs to be elucidated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. It is necessary to elucidate the combination of multiple pathogens for the elucidation of the etiology of PRDC, and Dempo -PCR will be a useful tool for that. PHEV is a subclinical infection, but its role as a respiratory pathogen was suggested since it was isolated from the acute respiratory disease in pigs in Michigan in 2015 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. The swine serological survey of PHEV also showed that it is widely and highly distributed in Japan [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. Therefore, PHEV was added to the target pathogens of Dempo-PCR, but it was not detected from these samples.",
            "In conclusion, Dempo-PCR can identify a wider range of existing pathogens quickly and easily compared to one assayone pathogen test. Considering multiple etiology of PRDC, screening by Dempo-PCR would help us determine treatment and prevention measures. This detection system may provide an alternative testing method that is simpler, faster, and more comprehensive than existing assays.",
