        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nTER94 is a multifunctional AAA+ ATPase crucial for diverse cellular processes, especially protein quality control and chromatin dynamics in eukaryotic organisms. Many viruses, including coronavirus, herpesvirus, and retrovirus, coopt host cellular TER94 for optimal viral invasion and replication. Previous proteomics analysis identified the association of TER94 with the budded virions (BVs) of baculovirus, an enveloped insect large DNA virus. Here, the role of TER94 in the prototypic baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) life cycle was investigated. In virus-infected cells, TER94 accumulated in virogenic stroma (VS) at the early stage of infection and subsequently partially rearranged in the ring zone region. In the virions, TER94 was associated with the nucleocapsids of both BV and occlusion-derived virus (ODV). Inhibition of TER94 ATPase activity significantly reduced viral DNA replication and BV production. Electron/immunoelectron microscopy revealed that inhibition of TER94 resulted in the trapping of nucleocapsids within cytoplasmic vacuoles at the nuclear periphery for BV formation and blockage of ODV envelopment at a premature stage within infected nuclei, which appeared highly consistent with its pivotal function in membrane biogenesis. Further analyses showed that TER94 was recruited to the VS or subnuclear structures through interaction with viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase, whereas inhibition of TER94 activity blocked the proper localization of replication-related viral proteins and morphogenesis of VS, providing an explanation for its role in viral DNA replication. Taken together, these data indicated the crucial functions of TER94 at multiple steps of the baculovirus life cycle, including genome replication, BV formation, and ODV morphogenesis.\nIMPORTANCE TER94 constitutes an important AAA+ ATPase that associates with diverse cellular processes, including protein quality control, membrane fusion of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum network, nuclear envelope reformation, and DNA replication. To date, little is known regarding the role(s) of TER94 in the baculovirus life cycle. In this study, TER94 was found to play a crucial role in multiple steps of baculovirus infection, including viral DNA replication and BV and ODV formation. Further evidence showed that the membrane fission/fusion function of TER94 is likely to be exploited by baculovirus for virion morphogenesis. Moreover, TER94 could interact with the viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase to transport and further recruit viral replication-related proteins to establish viral replication factories. This study highlights the critical roles of TER94 as an energy-supplying chaperon in the baculovirus life cycle and enriches our knowledge regarding the biological function of this important host factor.",

            "In recent years, accumulating studies have revealed that transient endoplasmic reticulum 94 (TER94, also termed CDC48 in yeast and plants or VCP/P97 in metazoan) plays crucial roles in diverse cellular processes. As a member of the<br/><br/>ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) ATPase family, TER94 utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to remodel substrate proteins [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] and functions mitochondria-associated degradation, autophagy, DNA damage response, membrane fusion, NF-\u03baB activation, and DNA replication [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. TER94 is an approximately 97<br/><br/>kDa protein in Xenopus laevis oocytes that contains two ATPase domains and forms hexamers (~612 kDa) to implement its versatile cellular functions by cooperating with its cofactors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].

Most baculoviruses have a unique bi-phasic life cycle characterized by the production of two distinct types of progeny virion phenotypes, budded virions (BVs) and occlusion-derived virions (ODVs). ODVs infect exclusively epithelium cells of the insect midgut to initiate primary infection, whereas BVs are subsequently produced and infect other cell types within larval bodies to spread systemic infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].

The subcellular localization of TER94 in infected cells under DBeQ treatment was also detected by IEM, with the results showing similar distribution to that in untreated cells (data not shown).

The six viral proteins fused with EGFP were expressed by transfection of recombinant plasmids into Sf9 cells separately and their colocalization with TER94 was detected in AcMNPV infected cells.

        "DISCUSSION": [

            "In the present study, insect cellular TER94 was detected as being exclusively associated with the nucleocapsid fractions of both AcMNPV BV and ODV (Fig. 1).",

            "A critical role of TER94 is to mediate membrane biogenesis, especially during nuclear envelope reassembly [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>]. During BV formation, the nuclear envelope evaginates and blebs to facilitate the egress of nucleocapsids from the nucleus. Then, the nude nucleocapsids escape from the nuclear envelope-derived vacuoles (egress vacuoles) and bud at the plasma membrane to form BVs. In our study, inhibition of",
            "TER94 resulted in the retention of nucleocapsids in the egress vacuoles and dramatically reduced the subsequent BV production (Fig. 4 and 5).

In addition, the last step of ODV morphogenesis requires splicing of the large and immature ODVs to small and mature ones [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c66\" href=\"#r66\">66</a>].

In a study of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus, four viral elements including IE1, LEF3, helicase, and hr could induce the subnuclear structure [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>].

The interaction of",
            "LEF3 with TER94 in the BiFC assay formed smaller fluorescent structures in chromatin-free regions (Fig. 7B), which also implied a role of TER94 in the subnuclear structure and VS formation. Subsequent inhibition of TER94 by DBeQ revealed that although small foci of IE1 and DBP could be observed, the further expansion of these foci was blocked, indicating the deficiency of VS formation. In addition, LEF3 accumulation in the subnuclear domain and nuclear transport of helicase were severely impaired (Fig. 8). Thus, we proposed that TER94 was recruited by LEF3 and helicase to the DNA replication foci to assist with the construction of",

In addition, TER94 is recruited by the LEF3-helicase complex to the foci and in turn facilitates other viral proteins to aggregate and form subnuclear compartments. The viral DNA synthesis in the subnuclear compartments promotes their development into VS. It is possible that TER94 may be packaged into the capsids together with some replication-related viral proteins, such as LEF3 and helicase. Moreover, TER94 was identified to interact with certain viral nucleocapsidor tegument proteins (data not shown), therefore it might specifically attach to nucleocapsids via interacting with these viral proteins to function during BV formation and ODV morphogenesis.
