After the outbreak of this disease, the overwhelming majority of cities have launched the \"first level response\" and the regular diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients are greatly affected. The digestive systemic cancer is the most common malignancy. Most patients are diagnosed in the advanced stage with poor prognosis. The epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia poses new challenges to diagnosis and treatment of the patients with digestive system malignancies. Based on the fully understanding of the characteristics of digestive system tumors, we should change the treatment strategy and adopt more reasonable treatment strategy timely during the epidemic period to minimize the adverse effects of the epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia on the treatment."
