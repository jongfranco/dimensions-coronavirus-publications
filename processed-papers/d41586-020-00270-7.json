            "The quest to develop a vaccine against HIV has been dealt a setback. Researchers running a trial of a once-promising vaccine in South Africa have stopped administering immunizations after an analysis showed that the vaccine was not effective. The study\u2019s sponsor, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, announced the trial\u2019s cancellation on 3 February.",
            "The trial, called HVTN 702, enrolled 5,407 people who did not have HIV, and they received either the vaccine or a placebo injection. The vaccine that participants received was similar to one that, in a previous trial in Thailand, had reduced infections by about 30% compared with the trial\u2019s placebo group. That marked the first-ever success for an HIV vaccine in a large trial, albeit a modest one.",
            "But an independent board that was monitoring interim data from the South Africa trial determined that, after most of the volunteers had been in the study for 18 months or more, the vaccine was not protecting participants from HIV infection. Among the 2,694 people who received the immunization, 129 contracted HIV; 123 of the 2,689 participants who received the placebo tested positive for HIV. Researchers will continue to follow the volunteers and try to determine why the vaccine failed."
