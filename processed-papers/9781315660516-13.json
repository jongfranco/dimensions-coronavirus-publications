            "In Chapter 13, Yongho Kim pays attention to the management of North Korea with specific focus on its nuclear problem. Kim argues that North Korea\u2019s motivations behind its nuclear program should be interpreted in accordance with Kim Jong Un\u2019s policy priorities. Specifically, his perception of whether economic packages contribute to promoting his personal political survival determines whether he will accept them. North Korea\u2019s 25-year path toward nuclearization demonstrates that possession of nuclear weapons is the only viable option to ensure the political survival of the Kim family. Both engagement and military pressure have failed to stop North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs. Engagement requires a considerable amount of time to build trust with and elicit cooperation from North Korea. Military pressure without a clear and present threat to Kim\u2019s personal political survival would only worsen the situation. The success of current nuclear negotiations with North Korea will depend on how Kim\u2019s political survival is guaranteed."
