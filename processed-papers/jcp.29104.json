        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of Poly (C)\u2010binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and the related signaling pathway in glioma progression. Quantitative real\u2010 time polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2010PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to measure PCBP2 messenger RNA and protein expression in glioma tissues or cells. Cell transfection was completed using Lipofectamine 2000. 3\u2010(4, 5\u2010Dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry assay were used to explore the effects of PCBP2 expression on biological behaviors of glioma cells. Western blot assay was used for the detection of pathway related proteins. Expression of PCBP2 in glioma tissues and cells were higher than that in paracancerous tissues and normal cells (both p < .01). Moreover, the elevated expression of PCBP2 was significantly correlated with tumor size (p = .001) and WHO stage (p = .010). Knockdown of PCBP2 could suppress proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells and promote apoptosis. Besides, the expression of transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2) pathway related proteins TGF\u2010\u03b21, p\u2010Smad2 and p\u2010Smad7 were decreased following the downregulation of PCBP2. PCBP2 also inhibited FHL3 expression by binding to FHL3\u20103\u2032UTR. The inhibition of FHL3 could reverse the antitumor action caused by PCBP2 silencing. In vivo assay, PCBP2 was also found to inhibit the tumor growth of glioma. PCBP2 activates TGF\u2010\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway by inhibiting FHL3 expression, thus promoting the development and progression of glioma.",

            "Glioma is a deadly malignancy, accounting for about 80% primary brain cancer (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOmuro_2013_a\" href=\"#rOmuro_2013_a\">Omuro & DeAngelis, 2013</a>). To improve the outcome of glioma, it is crucial to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor progression of glioma. In the current study, we found that PCBP2 silencing could inhibit glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promote cell apoptosis in vitro. PCBP2 might participate in glioma progression through regulating FHL3/TGF\u2010\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway.<br/><br/>PCBP2 is a RNA\u2010binding protein that can regulate RNA processing (Collier et al, 1998; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWan_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rWan_et+al_2016_a\">Wan et al, 2016</a>). Abnormal expression of PCBP2 may lead to genetic alterations, thus leading to human diseases, like cancer. In our study, we found that the expression of PCBP2 was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues and cells, compared with noncancerous tissues and normal cells. Furthermore, the elevated expression of PCBP2 showed the positive association with tumor size and WHO stages of glioma. The conclusion was consistent with the previous studies. Luo et al reported that the high expression of PCBP2 was closely correlated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis of GBM patients and it might be a potential prognostic biomarker for GBM patients (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLuo_2017_a\" href=\"#rLuo_2017_a\">Luo & Zhuang, 2017</a>).

        "4 | DISCUSSION": [
            "Glioma is a deadly malignancy, accounting for about 80% primary brain cancer (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cOmuro_2013_a\" href=\"#rOmuro_2013_a\">Omuro & DeAngelis, 2013</a>). To improve the outcome of glioma, it is crucial to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor progression of glioma. In the current study, we found that PCBP2 silencing could inhibit glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promote cell apoptosis in vitro. PCBP2 might participate in glioma progression through regulating FHL3/TGF\u2010\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway.",
            "PCBP2 is a RNA\u2010binding protein that can regulate RNA processing (Collier et al, 1998; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cWan_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rWan_et+al_2016_a\">Wan et al, 2016</a>). Abnormal expression of PCBP2 may lead to genetic alterations, thus leading to human diseases, like cancer. In our study, we found that the expression of PCBP2 was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues and cells, compared with noncancerous tissues and normal cells. Furthermore, the elevated expression of PCBP2 showed the positive association with tumor size and WHO stages of glioma. The conclusion was consistent with the previous studies. Luo et al reported that the high expression of PCBP2 was closely correlated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis of GBM patients and it might be a potential prognostic biomarker for GBM patients (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLuo_2017_a\" href=\"#rLuo_2017_a\">Luo & Zhuang, 2017</a>). Increased expression of PCBP2 may be a risk hallmark for glioma patients, predicting aggressive cancer progression.",
            "Given their function in RNA processing process, PCBP2 is involved in several cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as apoptosis. In the present study, in vitro experiments were performed to investigate the effects of PCBP2 on biological behaviors of glioma cells. The results demonstrated that cell growth and motility (migration and invasion) were significantly inhibited, and cell apoptosis was enhanced in transfected glioma cells when PCBP2 expression was decreased. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cTang_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rTang_et+al_2015_a\">Tang et al (2015</a>) indicated that the upregulation of PCBP2 could remarkably promote the cell proliferation and growth of glioma in vitro. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLin_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rLin_et+al_2016_a\">Lin et al (2016</a>) suggested that PCBP2 could facilitate the migration and invasion of glioma cells. These previous studies all supported the conclusions obtained in our study. PCBP2 may be an oncogene and therapeutic target in glioma.",
            "In addition, we also investigated the molecular mechanisms of PCBP2 in glioma progression. We found that the knockdown of PCBP2 might lead to high expression of FHL3 and low activity of TGF\u2010 \u03b2/Smad signaling pathway in glioma cells. Besides, the expression of FHL3 did not obviously influence the expression of PCBP2. Therefore, FHL3 might be a downstream target gene of PCBP2 in glioma. Moreover, the vivo mice experiment also verified the results in our study. A gene chip assay performed by Han et al also indicated the link between PCBP2 and FHL3 in glioma progression (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHan_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rHan_et+al_2013_a\">Han et al, 2013</a>). PCBP2 may bind to 3\u2032UTR of FHL3 gene (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHan_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rHan_et+al_2014_a\">Han, Xia, Yin, & Peng, 2014</a>). It has been reported to bind several target genes in diseases. PCBP2 could regulate CDK2 via direct 3\u2032UTR binding in gastric cancer patients, which might be used as a potential biomarker for the therapy of gastric cancer (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cChen_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rChen_et+al_2018_a\">Chen et al, 2018</a>). Xin et al also reported that PCBP2 could promote the antiviral activity of IFN\u2010\u03b1 against HCV by stabilizing the mRNA of STAT1 and STAT2 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cXin_et+al_2011_a\" href=\"#rXin_et+al_2011_a\">Xin et al, 2011</a>). In addition, we found that the inhibition of FHL3 expression might enhance TGF\u2010\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway activity in glioma cells which were transfected by si\u2010PCBP2. FHL3 protein belongs to LIM\u2010only proteins family and can enhance phosphorylation and unclear accumulation of Smad proteins, thereby leading to the activation of",
            "Certainly, several limitations in the current study should be stated. First, the sample size was relatively small that might reduce the statistical power of the current study. Second, the interaction between PCBP2 and other genes, as well as relative signaling pathways which might play potential roles in cancer development were not investigated in our study. The progression",
            "In conclusion, the upregulated expression of PCBP2 can promote glioma progression including enhancing cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibiting cell apoptosis.
