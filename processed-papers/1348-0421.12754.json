The S protein of SARS\u2010CoV contains a large amino\u2010terminal ectodomain and a short carboxy\u2010terminal endodomain bridged with a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (Figure 1a). The ectodomain of the S protein is extensively glycosylated with N\u2010linked glycosylation and has been reported to be important for interactions with receptors on the surface of host cells.14, 47 In addition, to avoid insoluble protein expression caused by numerous hydrophobic amino acids, the transmembrane domain including the carboxy\u2010terminal endodomain was removed from the recombinant spike protein (Figure 1a).

        "discussion": [
            "In the development of vaccine candidates against coronavirus infection, subunit vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and DNA vaccines targeting the viral S protein have been shown to be very effective in vivo.11, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 49-55 Subunit vaccines are considered highly safe products because they use antigenic components without the need to introduce viral particles.56 Furthermore, it is possible to induce cellular and humoral immune responses and high\u2010titer neutralizing antibodies when antigens are combined with appropriate adjuvants.26, 56 Researchers have previously produced recombinant baculovirus\u2010expressed SARS\u2010CoV S protein and showed that it could be used to induce a high production of neutralizing antibodies in mice.22, 26 However, lung eosinophilic immunopathology was not evaluated in these studies.<br/><br/>Honda\u2010Okubo et al reported that immunization with a commercial recombinant S protein, NR\u2010722 (Protein Science Corp., Meriden, CT), which is produced in insect cells, with or without alum adjuvant, resulted in lung eosinophilic immunopathology after SARS\u2010CoV infection (intramuscularly, twice with 1.0 \u00b5g S protein).28 They succeeded in avoiding the immunopathology induced by the vaccine by combining it with a delta insulin\u2010based polysaccharide adjuvant. The adjuvant induced IFN\u2010\u03b3 responses, suggesting that an inadequate vaccine\u2010induced Th1 response caused the lung eosinophilic immunopathology.28 This was also observed previously by Agrawal et al, who reported that inactivated MERS\u2010CoV vaccination leads to a lung eosinophilic immunopathology and IL\u20105 and IL\u201013 production upon live virus challenge in transgenic mice bearing the human CD26/DPP4 receptor.57 Severe pneumonia related coronaviruses such as SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV could induce the same pathology."

Currently, no vaccines or therapeutics are licensed for use against these coronaviruses. The spike (S) protein of coronaviruses binds to cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion for cell entry.10-12 Antibodies against S protein can block virus binding and fusion, and neutralize virus infection.13-18 Thus, the S protein is a candidate vaccine target for blocking coronavirus infection.11, 18-26 However, some animal studies have suggested that insufficient protective immunity against SARS\u2010CoV may induce an eosinophilic immunopathology in the lungs after the infection.27-29",
            "Enhanced lung eosinophilic immunopathology became a problem in the 1960s, when a formalin\u2010inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (FI\u2010RSV) vaccine combined with alum adjuvant was injected intramuscularly into children to immunize them against RSV.30-32 This outcome resulted in increased mortality due to enhanced respiratory disease upon subsequent RSV infection in immunized children. This increased mortality is thought to be due to a skewing of the immune response toward a Th2 response with enhanced eosinophil infiltration. In addition, the production of nonprotective antibodies in response to the FI\u2010RSV vaccine may have been due to poor Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) stimulation.33 In a previous study, we showed that a UV\u2010inactivated SARS\u2010CoV vaccine induced a strong Th2\u2010skewed immune response and that TLR agonists could limit the development of a lung eosinophilic immunopathology.34",
            "In this study, we produced a recombinant tagged protein containing the ectodomain of the SARS\u2010CoV S protein via a baculovirus expression system. We then evaluated the efficacy of the vaccine and its potential to induce a lung eosinophilic immunopathology in our murine SARS model.35 The recombinant S protein\u2010induced antibodies protected against SARS\u2010CoV infection; however, a lung eosinophilic immunopathology was observed in the lungs of immunized mice after SARS infection. Thus, even with the S protein vaccine, an adjuvant is required to prevent lung eosinophilic immunopathology following SARS\u2010CoV infection.",
            "Nanoparticle\u2010based vaccines have been expected to improve vaccine efficacy, immunization strategies, and targeted delivery to promote immune responses.36-38 Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have become the choice for immunotherapy applications because their physicochemical properties prevent antibody production against the platform material.36, 39 Furthermore, some in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that various immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, are stimulated by AuNPs leading to the production of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1) and Th1 cytokines (IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102).40 Thus, in this study, we evaluated two kinds of vaccine adjuvants, including AuNPs, which are expected to function as both an antigen carrier and an adjuvant in immunization; and TLR agonists, which have previously been shown to function as an adjuvant to increase the efficacy of an ultraviolet (UV)\u2010inactivated SARS\u2010CoV vaccine.34"

            "A recombinant tagged protein that included the ectodomain of the SARS\u2010CoV S protein was generated using a baculovirus expression system. The S protein of SARS\u2010CoV contains a large amino\u2010terminal ectodomain and a short carboxy\u2010terminal endodomain bridged with a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (Figure 1a). The ectodomain of the S protein is extensively glycosylated with N\u2010linked glycosylation and has been reported to be important for interactions with receptors on the surface of host cells.14, 47 In addition, to avoid insoluble protein expression caused by numerous hydrophobic amino acids, the transmembrane domain including the carboxy\u2010terminal endodomain was removed from the recombinant spike protein (Figure 1a). Higher expression was obtained from a construct encoding a recombinant SARS\u2010CoV S protein containing a Strep\u20108x his\u2010tag at the carboxyl terminus compared with that obtained from an 8x his\u2010tagged construct. After purification of the recombinant tagged protein from culture supernatant via gel filtration chromatography, the identity of the recombinant protein, with an expected molecular weight of 135 kDa, was confirmed via SDS\u2010PAGE and western blotting (Figure 1b).",
            "To confirm the immunogenicity of the recombinant SARS\u2010CoV S protein, purified protein was used for immunization into BALB/c mice. Groups of 6\u20137 mice were immunized with different amounts of recombinant S protein (1.0, 0.5, 0.1, or 0.05 \u00b5g per immunization) and then challenged with mouse\u2010adapted SARS\u2010CoV. Two weeks after the second immunization with the SARS\u2010CoV S protein, the dose\u2010dependency of the antigen\u2010specific IgG production was assessed in all the immunized mice (Figure 2a). Approximately 6 weeks after the second immunization, all the mice (12 weeks old at the time of the challenge) were intranasally inoculated with mouse\u2010adapted SARS\u2010CoV. Nonimmunized animals showed body weight reductions of approximately 17% compared with the initial body weight, and four of six mice were moribund and were euthanized within 5 days postinoculation (dpi) (Figure 2b). Two animals were fully recovered by 6 dpi. On the other hand, all of the immunized animals showed body weight loss within 2 dpi, and the animals in the 1.0 and 0.5 \u00b5g immunized groups had recovered by 4 dpi; however, three of seven mice in the 0.1 \u00b5g immunized group and three of six in the 0.05 \u00b5g immunized group did not recover and were moribund. Animals that survived had recovered fully by 5 or 6 dpi.

The recombinant S protein was used at 0.1 \u00b5g/mouse for immunization.",
            "Conjugation of S protein to AuNPs was confirmed by detecting changes in the diameter of the AuNPs after BSPP coating and S protein binding by DLS (Table 1). Then, the optimal AuNP concentration was determined by measuring the virus\u2010specific Ig G response (UV\u2010inactivated SARS\u2010CoV was used as the ELISA antigen) after the second immunization. Stable results were obtained when 0.1 \u00b5g S protein + 2 fmol AuNPs were used to immunize BALB/c mice (Figure 4a,b). We also evaluated the influence of the diameter of the AuNPs on animal immunization. The effects of the size and shape of the AuNPs on the immunological response was previously evaluated in a study of West Nile virus envelope protein (WNV\u2010E protein).39 The WNV\u2010E protein\u2010coated 40 nm spherical AuNPs induced sufficient levels of WNV\u2010E\u2010specific antibodies. The WNV particle is around 40 nm in diameter. We evaluated 100 nm spherical AuNPs with a modified SARS\u2010CoV particle, ranging from 50 to 200 nm in diameter.48 Animal experiments revealed that there were no differences in the IgG response when spherical AuNPs with diameters between 40 and 100 nm were used for the immunization (Figure 4c). We used 0.1 \u00b5g S protein with 2 fmol of 40 nm AuNPs in the following experiments.",

Images were captured using an LAS 4000 Luminoimage analyzer (Fujifilm) and then analyzed using the ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). The percentage of protein bound to the AuNPs was 28.3 + 5.9% (five experiments). In addition, the structure of the S+AuNPs was examined by transmission electron microscopy (Figure 4e), which confirmed S protein binding to the AuNPs and the presence of free S protein in solution.",

        "4 DISCUSSION": [
            "In the development of vaccine candidates against coronavirus infection, subunit vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and DNA vaccines targeting the viral S protein have been shown to be very effective in vivo.11, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 49-55 Subunit vaccines are considered highly safe products because they use antigenic components without the need to introduce viral particles.56 Furthermore, it is possible to induce cellular and humoral immune responses and high\u2010titer neutralizing antibodies when antigens are combined with appropriate adjuvants.26, 56 Researchers have previously produced recombinant baculovirus\u2010expressed SARS\u2010CoV S protein and showed that it could be used to induce a high production of neutralizing antibodies in mice.22, 26 However, lung eosinophilic immunopathology was not evaluated in these studies.",
            "Honda\u2010Okubo et al reported that immunization with a commercial recombinant S protein, NR\u2010722 (Protein Science Corp., Meriden, CT), which is produced in insect cells, with or without alum adjuvant, resulted in lung eosinophilic immunopathology after SARS\u2010CoV infection (intramuscularly, twice with 1.0 \u00b5g S protein).28 They succeeded in avoiding the immunopathology induced by the vaccine by combining it with a delta insulin\u2010based polysaccharide adjuvant. The adjuvant induced IFN\u2010\u03b3 responses, suggesting that an inadequate vaccine\u2010induced Th1 response caused the lung eosinophilic immunopathology.28 This was also observed previously by Agrawal et al, who reported that inactivated MERS\u2010CoV vaccination leads to a lung eosinophilic immunopathology and IL\u20105 and IL\u201013 production upon live virus challenge in transgenic mice bearing the human CD26/DPP4 receptor.57 Severe pneumonia related coronaviruses such as SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV could induce the same pathology.",
            "In this study, we explored the potential of AuNPs for use as an adjuvant to promote immune responses with balanced effects on Th1 and Th2 T\u2010cell immunity.36, 39, 40 AuNPs stimulate macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes after induction of proinflammatory cytokine (i.e., IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1) and Th1 cytokine (i.e., IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102) expression.40 Niikura et al demonstrated that AuNP\u2010adjuvanted West Nile virus E protein (10 \u00b5g) showed high antigenicity in mice and induced inflammatory cytokine production, including TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106, IL\u201012, and GM\u2010CSF, by antigen\u2010presenting cells in vitro.39 Indeed, AuNP\u2010adjuvanted S protein induced strong IgG responses to S protein itself in this study; however, it failed to induce protective immune responses and to limit eosinophilic infiltrations after virus challenge. One explanation for the failure to induce protective immune responses could be that structural changes in S protein upon binding to the AuNP adjuvant resulted in S\u2010binding IgGs that were unable to neutralize the virus.58 AuNPs and S protein bind together via electrostatic interactions and S\u2010protein forms a \u201cprotein corona\u201d around AuNPs.59, 60 Indeed, both the DLS and TEM structure analysis indicated that the conjugated S protein on AuNPs formed a protein corona, which is considered to result in structural changes in adsorbed proteins59 for adaptation to the nanoparticle surface and surrounding environment.61 The protein secondary structure is strongly affected by the surface charge of AuNPs.62 The particle surface of a protein corona defines the biological identity of the particle when it is attached to the cell surface in vivo.58, 59 Thus, even a small modification in S protein structure could impact both negatively and positively on its immunogenicity. More work will be required to study the mechanisms and to test whether the AuNP\u2010adjuvanted vaccine is effective against coronavirus infection (i.e., effect of antigen binding methods, antigen against the receptor binding site).",
            "Cytokine and chemokine analysis revealed that each group of mice had different lung immune responses early after SARS\u2010CoV infection. While similar virus titers were observed in the lungs of non\u2010, S protein\u2010, and S+AuNP\u2010immunized mice, Type 1 IFN and proinflammatory responses were moderate in both the S protein\u2010 and S+AuNP\u2010immunized mice. After infection, Type 1 IFNs are secreted by infected cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells to counteract viral infection.63, 64 Type 1 IFNs up\u2010regulate pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL\u201012.63 The macrophage\u2010related chemokine responses were similar among the non\u2010, S protein\u2010, and S+AuNP\u2010immunized mice; however, the Th1 and Th2 responses were higher in the S protein\u2010 and S+AuNP\u2010immunized mice. The cells may also moderate proinflammatory reactions in the animals in these groups. Interestingly, although S protein\u2010immunized mice showed significant protection against SARS\u2010CoV infection, the virus titers remained higher than those in non\u2010immunized mice. In adult mouse models of SARS\u2010CoV infection, the excessive host innate immune responses contributing to SARS\u2010CoV lung pathology are complex and involve changes in activated macrophages and neutrophils.65-67 We previously reported that IFN\u2010\u03b3 treatment 3 hr after inoculation protected mice from severe SARS\u2010CoV\u2010induced pulmonary edema that otherwise results in the death of uninoculated adult mice.35 However, the virus titer in the lungs did not differ between the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010treated and PBS\u2010treated adult mice. In this study, S protein\u2010immunized mice showed an IFN\u2010\u03b3 response on day 1 pi. Thus, we speculated that IFN\u2010\u03b3 induction may contribute to protection against SARS in the S protein immunized mice.",
            "The PBS pretreated challenge control mice showed very slight changes in the bronchi area of the lungs after SARS\u2010CoV infection (Figures 3a and 6b). The pathological changes in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected lungs, including diffuse alveolar damage, were mainly seen in the alveolar area.35 However, eosinophil infiltrations occurred around middle size blood vessels in the bronchi area. Thus, we demonstrated the bronchi area from animals in these figures, whereas small changes (i.e., a few inflammatory cell infiltrations around the blood vessels with edema) were observed in the bronchi area of the control mouse. The histopathological findings of eosinophil infiltration around the bronchiole on day 10 pi were correlated with a high production of allergic inflammation cytokines, that is, IL\u201013, IL\u20104, IL\u20105, and eotaxin, in both the S protein\u2010 and S+AuNP\u2010immunized mice. These findings suggest that the amount of antibody generated against SARS\u2010CoV was not sufficient to orchestrate immune responses, including innate immunity and Th2\u2010skewed responses, during the infection.",
            "In this study, AuNPs did not show dose dependency in eliciting immune responses. When low\u2010molecular weight poly(I:C)s were conjugated with gold nanorods as adjuvants for intranasal hemagglutinin (HA) influenza vaccination, low doses of AuNPs (i.e., 1 fmol) were more effective in reducing virus replication in a nasal wash than 10\u2010fold higher doses of gold nanorods (i.e., 10 fmol).68 On the other hand, Mottram et al showed that the nanoparticle size of carboxyl\u2010modified polystyrene beads carrying whole ovalbumin influenced the Th1 and Th2 immune reactions. When 40\u201350 nm beads were used to vaccinate mice, high IFN\u2010\u03b3 induction was observed, whereas 93\u2013123 nm beads induced IL\u20104 production.69 Although we did not evaluate in detail the influence of the amount and size of AuNPs, the amount and size of AuNPs should be carefully considered if nanoparticle vaccine platforms are used for the development of coronavirus vaccines.",
            "In this study, we expressed S protein via a recombinant baculovirus system. Purification of recombinant SARS\u2010CoV S protein was more effective when expression was from a construct containing a Strep\u20108x his\u2010tag at the S protein carboxyl terminus than when a 8x his\u2010tagged construct was used. The purification was conducted only via His trap purification using affinity chromatography to minimize protein loss. After the second immunization with the purified recombinant S protein, high IgG levels against immunogen\u2010specific IgG were detected in the murine sera, and they were protective against SARS\u2010CoV infection in vivo (subcutaneously, twice with 1.0 or 0.5 \u00b5g of S protein). The purified protein showed high immunogenicity in BALB/c mice but did not prevent eosinophilic infiltrations.",
            "Mice of different ages were used in this study. Young adult mice (6 or 7\u2010week\u2010old female) were used to confirm the immunogenicity of recombinant S protein and S+AuNP and adult mice (13 weeks old; challenged at 17 weeks old) were used for the challenge experiment. There were significant differences in the levels of the virus\u2010specific IgG titer in mice immunized with 0.1 \u00b5g of S+AuNP between Figures 4a and 5b. We speculate that the difference could be due to differences in the ages of the mice employed in these experiments. In general, young adult (around 6 weeks old) mice show more robust immune responses than old mice, and the robustness of the immune response decreases with age.70 In addition, the intervals between the first immunization and the time\u2010points of sera collection were different. We conducted a minimum dose immunization of adult BALB/c mice with the S protein (subcutaneously, twice with 0.1 \u00b5g S protein). A total of 0.1 \u00b5g of TLR agonist\u2010adjuvanted S protein induced a sufficiently high expression of neutralizing antibodies and prevented the eosinophilic infiltrations. After SARS\u2010CoV infection, induction of GM\u2010CSF, RANTES, IL\u201010, IL\u20102, MIG, and IL\u201017, but not Type 1 IFN expression was detected in the lungs of S+TLR\u2010immunized mice that had sufficient antiviral antibodies. Interestingly, only the S+TLR\u2010immunized mice showed high levels of IL\u201017 within 5 dpi, suggesting that a Th17 response occurred in the lungs during SARS\u2010CoV infection in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, a Th1/Th17 bias in cytokine induction was also observed in a study of SARS\u2010CoV S protein when delta inulin was used as an adjuvant.28 The activation of specific T\u2010cell subsets by adjuvants may be critical to ensure vaccine efficacy and eosinophilic immunopathology upon SARS\u2010CoV infection.",
            "Overall, AuNP\u2010adjuvanted S protein induced an antigen\u2010specific IgG response but failed to induce a protective antibody and limit eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs. On the other hand, the TLR agonists successfully minimized the amount of recombinant S protein required for the vaccination to 0.1 \u00b5g, and increased vaccine immunogenicity and reduced eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs after the SARS\u2010CoV challenge infection in our mouse model. To prevent insufficient immunization against SARS\u2010CoV, even with an S protein\u2010based vaccine, appropriate adjuvant development is needed. The findings of this study will support the development of vaccines not only against SARS\u2010CoV infection but also against other severe pneumonia\u2010related coronaviruses, likely including MERS\u2010CoV.",
