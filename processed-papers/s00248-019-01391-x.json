        "abstract": "Bats are flying mammals distributed worldwide known to host several types of Coronavirus (CoV). Since they were reported as the probable source of spillover of highly pathogenic CoV into the human population, investigating the circulation of this virus in bats around the world became of great importance. We analyzed samples from 103 bats from two distinct regions in Brazil. Coronavirus from the Alphacoronavirus genus was detected in 12 animals, 11 from S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto\u2014SP region and 1 from Barreiras\u2014BA region, resulting in a prevalence of 17.18% and 2.56% respectively. The virus was detected not only in intestines but also in lungs and liver. Phylogenetic analysis based on nsP12 genomic region suggests that the sequences group according to host family and sampling location. Studies on the circulation of these viruses in bats remain important to understand the ecology and evolutionary relationship of these pathogens.",

            "16.7% reported in bats from Hong Kong [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. Although one study in the UK reported a comparably high BtCoV prevalence of 23% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>], reported prevalence rates usually range from 3% to 10% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>], similar to our current findings in the Barreiras region (2.56%). A global study with over 12,000 samples reported a BtCoV prevalence of 8.6% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. The CoV prevalence among bats from the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto region is therefore higher than estimated for Barreiras as well as compared to other studies. Several factors might influence the estimates, like the number of specimens sampled, host species diversity, number of sites of collection, geographic regions, among others [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. In this study, 54.5% (6/11) of the infected specimens from S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto region were collected in the same site. The location is a private property known to harbor about six different species of bats in the roof of the house. The fact that these animals were collected in the same location might have influenced the high CoV prevalence in this region, since they live in close contact aiding the transmission. Another factor that might have influenced is that in addition to intestines, we also analyzed lungs and liver for the presence of CoV, while most prevalence studies only test fecal or intestine samples. Although most of the infected animals tested positive in the intestines (81.8%\u20149/11), in two animals, CoV was only detected in other organs (lungs and liver), raising the chances of viral detection. Other authors have also reported the presence of CoV RNA in tissues and secretions other than intestines or fecal samples, such as kidney, heart, Fig. 3 Bayesian phylogenetic tree based on a dataset of 139 nucleotide sequences of 338 bp from the nsP12 genomic region of CoV . The analysis includes sequences of BtCoV from the \u03b1-CoV genus. Nodes display posterior probabilities higher than 0.7. Tips are colored according to the host family (see legend). Sequences generated in this study lungs, and oropharyngeal swabs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>]. However, this is the first report of BtCoV detection in the liver. Since the animals presented no clinical symptoms, the significance of the detection of virus in lungs and liver remains unclear. Experimental infection of bats with CoV from the Betacoronavirus genus has been tried by",
            "Watanabe and colleagues [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>]. Results revealed that the virus was only detected in the intestines. In our study, the infection of lungs and liver was not restricted to one host species or family since it was found in Molossus rufus (Molossidae), Eptesicus sp. (Vespertilionidae), and Glossophaga soricina (Phyllostomidae).",
            "We analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of the virus identified in this study with other BtCoV from the \u03b1-CoV genus (Fig. 3). The sequences generated in our study are distributed in three distinct monophyletic branches. Most sequences, 13 out of 16, of CoV identified in bats from S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto grouped into a monophyletic branch with strong posterior probability (0.77). In the same branch, there are also three sequences of CoV identified in bats from the cities of Ara\u00e7atuba (KC886321) and Penapolis (KT717388, KT717389), about 100 km distant from S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto. This cluster shares a most recent common ancestor, also with high branch support, with the virus we identified in a Molossus molossus bat in Barreiras",
            "Hainan_China (BtCoV_BA19I). The sequence BtCoV_SJRP44I groups apart from all other in a monophyletic branch (0.99) together with sequence KT717382. Both viruses were detected in Artibeus literatus bats. It is interesting that KT717382 was identified in Igua\u00e7u National Park\u2014PR, about 850 km from S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto\u2014SP, in 2012 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Sequences BtCoV_SJRP08I and BtCoV_SJRP22I, both from Phyllostomus discolor bats, group together in another monophyletic branch sharing a most recent common ancestor with a CoV from a P. discolor (JQ731783) bat collected in Panama [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Both clusters include all strains, included in the analysis, identified in the respective species. This indicates that the BtCoV identified in these hosts could be species-specific, being more closely related to the viruses identified in the same host, even if they are geographically distant. In fact, other sequences from our study, from hosts collected in the same sites, were infected with BtCoV that grouped apart from the P. discolor and A. literatus clusters (Fig. 3; Online Resource 2). An alternative explanation is that the occurrence of related strains in distant locations is a consequence of transmission during bat migration. Given the genetic distance between the strains sampled, this would obviously not be due to direct transmission but would presumably involve unsampled intermediate strains. Several bat species are known to migrate seasonally following resources, such as food. Migration studies report that small- and medium-sized bats can migrate long distances, with a maximum migration distance of 1905 km reported for a Vespertilionidae bat [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>]. However, there are no studies of migration patterns for P. discolor and few for A. literatus, none of which report such long distance [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>]. It is therefore more likely that the close relatedness of BtCoV from P. discolor and from A. literatus is a reflection of the virus Bhost specificity.^",
            "Overall, the BtCoV phylogenetic tree shows highly supported branches clustering primarily according to host family. Some families have two different clusters like Molossidae, Phyllostomidae, and Rhinolophidae while Miniopteridae and Hipposideridae present only one each. Since there are some exceptions and CoV from Vespertilionidae bats does not seem to group together, we statistically tested the hypothesis of a positive relationship between host family and phylogeny and it was confirmed. However, due to the exceptions, we decided to test for a possible association with location where the hosts were collected. For example, as previously described, most CoV from S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto grouped into a monophyletic and most of them belong to the Molossidae family. Still, among them there are sequences from virus identified in two animals from other families, Vespertilionidae (BtCoV_SJRP06) and Phyllostomidae (BtCoV_SJRP10). So, we statistically tested for an association between the location where the host was collected and phylogeny and there is also a positive association. Our results indicate that despite the association between BtCoV and host family seen here, the close contact between animals from different families may result in virus transmission. We conclude that both traits, host family and location, influence BtCoV phylogenetic relationship.",
            "Here, we report the detection of Alphacoronavirus in bats from Brazil, not only in intestines but also in lungs and liver. We found a higher prevalence of BtCoV in animals collected in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto\u2014SP region, when compared to Barreiras\u2014BA. The investigation of CoV in bats throughout the world remains important to characterize and understand the circulation of these viruses, identifying potential sources of spillover of pathogenic strains into the human population.",

            "Understanding the diversity and the ecological aspects of these viruses in bats is important to prevent new outbreaks.",
            "The authors investigated the presence of Coronavirus RNA in bats, living in urban and peri-urban areas, from two geographically distant regions in Brazil, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto\u2014SP and Barreiras\u2014BA.",
            "A prevalence of 17.2% was observed among bats sampled from the S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto region which is similar to the rate of"
