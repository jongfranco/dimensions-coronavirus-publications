        "abstract": "The arenaviruses represent a diverse group of ribonucleic acid viruses with the potential to cause severe disease in both humans and boid snakes. At 2017 more than 30 different arenaviruses had been described and have been sorted in the two genera Mammarenavirus and Reptarenavirus. These viruses share structural, antigenic, and genomic features, but each has a unique epidemiological and ecological repertoire. The mammarenaviruses includes mostly rodent-borne viruses that have not been associated with human or animal disease. A total of 11 of the mammarenaviruses have been linked to human disease, varying from subclinical and mild infections to fatal hemorrhagic fevers. The reptarenaviruses have been isolated from boas and pythons suffering from inclusion body disease. The complex evolutionary history of these viruses remains to be fully understood, but with the continued discovery of novel arenaviruses and at the hand of technologies such as deep sequencing, the pieces of the puzzle can be put together. The segmented genomes and remarkable genomic sequence diversity of these viruses also allows for the study of the potential drivers of the emergence of novel viruses through recombination and segment switching which also elude to the interaction of the hosts of these viruses. This chapter provides a summary of the history of the arenaviruses and describes their structure, replication, and pathobiology. In addition, an overview of arenavirus ecology and epidemiology and a discussion on developments for prophylaxis and treatment for arenaviral infections are reviewed.",
