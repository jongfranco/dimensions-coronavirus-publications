            "In conclusion, the most common patterns of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia on thin-section CT images are pure ground-glass opacity (GGO), GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening, GGO with consolidation, and consolidation, with prominent distribution in the posterior and peripheral part of the lungs. Consolidation lesions could serve as a marker of disease progression or more severe disease. Although the positive nucleic acid testing is the diagnostic reference standard, patients with fever and/or cough and with GGO-prominent lesions in the peripheral and posterior part of lungs on CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, should be highly suspected of having 2019-nCoV pneumonia."

All CT examinations were performed with a 64-section scanner (Scenaria 64 CT; Hitachi Medical, Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture, Japan) without the use of contrast material. The CT protocol was as follows: tube voltage, 120 kV; automatic tube current (180 mA\u2013400 mA); iterative reconstruction technique; detector, 64 mm; rotation time, 0.35 second; section thickness, 5 mm; collimation, 0.625 mm; pitch, 1.5; matrix, 512 3 512; and breath hold at full inspiration. Reconstruction kernel used was lung smooth with a thickness of 1 mm and an interval of 0.8 mm.

On the axial CT images, we drew a horizontal line across the axillary midline to divide anterior and posterior parts of the lungs. The outer one-third of the lung was defined as peripheral, and the rest was defined as central.",

The laboratory results of normal blood cells could also be helpful to make the diagnosis. In our study, the average age was 49 years, ranging from 16\u201376 years, and only 11 patients (22%) had coexisting medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease. This is different from influenza A (H7N9) virus pneumonia, which tends to affect older adults (aged 66 years, with a range of 48\u201381 years) with coexisting chronic diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].",
            "Most pulmonary lesions involved bilateral lungs with multiple lung lobes, with predominant distribution in posterior and peripheral part of the lungs. Studies showed that influenza pneumonia tend to affect lower lung [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Wang et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] also showed that H7N9 pneumonia had a predominant distribution in the right lower lung. Both H1N1 pneumonia and SARS distributed more peripherally [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], while there was no lobar predilection in H5N1 influenza [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. The posterior and peripheral lung predominant distribution in our study is characteristic. Such distribution is conspicuous at first glance of the images.",
            "The observation regarding the high prevalence of bilateral organizing pneumonia in these patients is potentially of importance. This suggests that corticosteroids might be an option to suppress this immune reaction within the lung parenchyma to 2019-nCoV pneumonia.",
            "Our results showed that the most common imaging findings were pure GGO, GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening, and GGO with consolidation. Complete consolidation was relatively less common (in 55% of patients in 13% of lesions), which might be explained by the early stage of the disease. In H7N9 pneumonia, most cases showed consolidation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>].

GGO, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening are also the most common thin-section CT findings of H1N1 influenza pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. The four patterns in our imaging findings\u2014pure GGO, GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening, GGO with consolidation, and consolidation\u2014were often mixed, and tended to appear simultaneously in the same patient. While the pure GGO is a common single finding in 77% of patients and in 30% of lesions in the 2019-nCoV pneumonia, the main CT features were all patterns of GGO, including pure GGO, GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening, and GGO with radiology.rsna.org  n  Radiology: Volume 00: Number 0\u2014 2020",
            "consolidation, which were observed in all patients and accounted for 87% of lesions. These CT findings combined together, with predominant distribution in posterior and peripheral part of the lungs, were uncommon in other viral pneumonia.",
            "Our study showed that consolidation indicated disease progression. There were more consolidation lesions and fewer GGO lesions in the patients with CT interval greater than or equal to 4 days than in patients with CT interval less than or equal to 4 days, which likely indicates that consolidation increases as disease course extends. In addition, there were significantly more consolidation lesions and less GGO lesions in older patients than in younger patients. Therefore, finding of consolidation lesions would serve as an alert in the treatment of patients.",
            "There were several limitations in our study. First, the sample size was very small with follow-up CT. In addition, the follow-up CT had a short time interval. It would be still inconclusive with CT follow-up findings to evaluate treatment efficacy. Second, there was lack of severe infection, to compare findings with severe infection with mild infection. Third, there was lack of pediatric population. Finally, no lung tissue biopsies were available to investigate correlation between radiologic and histopathologic findings.",
            "In conclusion, the most common patterns of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia on thin-section CT images are pure ground-glass opacity (GGO), GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening, GGO with consolidation, and consolidation, with prominent distribution in the posterior and peripheral part of the lungs. Consolidation lesions could serve as a marker of disease progression or more severe disease. Although the positive nucleic acid testing is the diagnostic reference standard, patients with fever and/or cough and with GGO-prominent lesions in the peripheral and posterior part of lungs on CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, should be highly suspected of having 2019-nCoV pneumonia.",
