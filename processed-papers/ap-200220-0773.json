        "abstract": "Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.",

            "Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.",

            "Significant efforts have been made to develop therapeutic interventions against coronavirus infection. Major research has been focused on identifying anti-viral molecules targeting the spike protein as it mediates viral entry, and their potential in inducing host immune responses and eliciting protective antibody responses in infected individuals. In this review, we highlight the therapeutic potential of neutralizing antibodies that showed promising efficacy against SARS-CoV or MERSCoV which might have the potential for the therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Therapeutic Intervention for COVID-19 Neither an effective vaccines nor anti-viral therapeutic agents have been approved to treat COVID-19 or any other human CoV infection till date. The current approach to coronavirus disease management focuses on supportive care. Rapid public health interventions with antibodies, anti-virals or novel vaccine strategies are highly essential to contain the virus and disease transmission. Passive antibody therapy can be considered as a way to limit COVID-19 epidemics. Passive immunization of antibody that can recognize epitopic regions in the foreign virus particle can reduce the virus replication and disease severity. Antibodies for passive immunotherapy can be isolated from the blood of the infected patients or it can be manufactured in the laboratory. Immunotherapy by transferring the convalescent sera to infected patients may be effective in humans in neutralizing the virus and prevent further infection. Based on the existing evidence and prior experience in treating other viral infections such as influenza, SARS, MERS and Ebola, the early administration of convalescent plasma or hyper-immune immunoglobulin from patients that contains significant antibody titers can likely reduce the viral load and disease mortality.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] However, the key challenges such as availability of sufficient donors, clinical condition, viral kinetics, and host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be elucidated before considering convalescent plasma as a therapeutic option. However, there is an urgent need to consider novel therapies for treating clinically advanced conditions in order to reduce mortality, virus spread and to mitigate the potential future outbreaks. Although researchers are in the process of developing specific preventive and therapeutic intervention strategies including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, peptides, interferon therapies and small-molecule drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2, it may require several months to test its efficacy in vitro/in vivo and also it largely depends on the results of the clinical trials. Even though this virus is newly identified, the clinical and genetic features showed similarity with SARS-CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] Their similarities would make it easier to utilize the existing knowledge and adapt the available vaccines or therapeutic models developed against other coronaviruses to target the unique aspects of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Immunotherapy is regarded as an effective method for clinical treatment of infectious diseases. The use of monoclonal antibodies is a new era in infectious disease prevention which overcomes many drawbacks associated with serum therapy and intravenous immunoglobulins preparations in terms of specificity, purity, low risk of blood-borne pathogen contamination and safety. Monoclonal antibodies are versatile class of pharmaceuticals that have been successfully used by pharmaceutical industry which can provide an efficient therapeutic intervention with a highly specific treatment against particular disease.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Many monoclonal antibodies against viruses are developed in recent years and some are in clinical pipeline.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]",
            "CoV infection starts with the interaction of receptor binding domain located in the S protein and target receptor on the host cell surface such as Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) for MERS-CoV.27 The effective treatment options against SARSCoV-2 can either based on the use of broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs or by using specific therapeutic molecules that can directly interrupt any stages of the viral lifecycle or the receptor proteins located in the host cell surface to restrain the virus binding thereby blocking the virus attachment and entry. This can be achieved by using peptidic fusion inhibitors, antiSARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, anti-ACE2 monoclonal antibodies and protease inhibitors. The spike protein present on the viral membrane plays a vital role in virus entry and is the principal antigenic component responsible for inducing host immune response.28 Hence, it has been considered as a key target to develop potential effective therapeutics against coronavirus infection. The receptor-binding motif located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 sub-unit of spike protein interacts with the cell receptor and mediates the virus attachment with the host cells.29 Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for its attachment and entry (Figure 1).30-32 Hence the therapies for SARS-CoV can be extrapolated to use for SARS-CoV-2. The specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies either against receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike protein or specific antibody that binds to ACE2 could effectively block the virus entry (Figure 2). The structure of SARSCoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike protein and monoclonal antibody interaction sites are shown in figures 3, 4, and 5. The protein structure figures were generated by PyMOL. As both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 uses same host cell surface receptor, potential blocking agents or strategies tested to prevent SARS entry could be evaluated against SARS-CoV-2. <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCoughlin_2012_a\" href=\"#rCoughlin_2012_a\">Coughlin and Prabhakar, (2012</a>) reported a series of human monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD region of S protein",
