        "abstract": "First reported from Wuhan, The People's Republic of China, on 31 December 2019, the ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV) causes great global concerns. Based on the advice of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee and the fact that to date 24 other countries also reported cases, the WHO Director\u2010General declared that the outbreak of 2019\u2010nCoV constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. Together with the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV), 2019\u2010nCov and other yet to be identified coronaviruses pose a global threat to public health. In this mini\u2010review, we provide a brief introduction to the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV and extrapolate this knowledge to the newly identified 2019\u2010nCoV.",

We infer that a combination of such treatments would be the most suitable therapeutic strategy for more severe human coronavirus infections. However, we must bear in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS, MERS, and 2019\u2010 nCoV, and therefore further research into the pathogenesis of human coronavirus infection is imperative for identifying appropriate therapeutic targets."

            "The available pathology data for SARS\u2010CoV infections were mainly obtained from autopsies. The predominant visceral macroscopic changes in fatal SARS\u2010CoV cases have been edematous lungs with increased gross weights and multiple areas of congestion, enlargement of lymph nodes in the pulmonary hila and the abdominal cavity, as well as a diminished spleen size and reduced spleen weights.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>] Morphological changes were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] The histological feature in the early phase of pulmonary SARS\u2010CoV infections is commonly associated with acute diffuse alveolar damage, while later phases of the disease demonstrate a combination of diffuse alveolar damage and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] Large numbers of SARS\u2010CoV particles and genomic sequences were detected within circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, and lymphoid tissues, as well as in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, the intestinal mucosa, the epithelium of renal distal tubules, neurons in the brain, and tissue\u2010resident macrophages residing in different organs.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Co\u2010localization of SARS\u2010CoV RNA and cellular cytokeratins within the lung was evident by immunofluorescent in situ hybridization, suggesting that pneumocytes become infected.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Accordingly, electron microscopic examinations also showed SARS\u2010CoV virions and nucleocapsid inclusions in pneumocytes.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Additionally, SARS\u2010CoV may occasionally be identified in the alveolar macrophages of the lung.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]",
            "The mechanisms underlying more severe pathogenicity of SARS\u2010CoV are so far not fully understood. Extensive lung damage in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected patients appears to be associated with high initial virus titers,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] increased monocyte, macrophage, and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] and elevated levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Therefore, the clinical deterioration of SARS\u2010CoV infection may result from a combination of direct virus\u2010induced cytopathic effects and immunopathology induced by a hyper\u2010cytokinemia or a \u201ccytokine\u2010storm.\u201d Studies of the changes in cytokine/chemokine profiles during SARS\u2010CoV infection revealed increased levels of circulating cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), CXCL\u201010, interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106), and IL\u20108, likely contributed to the poor prognosis in SARS\u2010CoV infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]",
            "High serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL\u20101, IL\u20106, IL\u201012, Interferon \u03b3 [IFN\u2010\u03b3], and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, and IL\u20108) were found in patients with SARS with severe disease compared to individuals with uncomplicated SARS.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] In addition, the early induction of CXCL10 and IL\u20102, as well as the subsequent hyperproduction of IL\u20106 with a coinciding lack of IL\u201010 production are thought to contribute to the immuno\u2010pathological processes involved in lung injury during SARS\u2010 CoV infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] Additionally, robust and persistent expression of",

            "The understanding of pathophysiological changes caused by MERS\u2010 CoV infections relies on limited numbers of autopsy and biopsy cases. Few studies indicate that the pathological features of MERS\u2010CoV infection include exudative diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes, pulmonary edema, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial pneumonia (which was predominantly lymphocytic), and multinucleate syncytial cells.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Bronchial submucosal gland necrosis was also observed.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] These bronchial lesions comprise the pathologic basis for the respiratory failure and radiologic abnormalities of MERS\u2010CoV infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] Target cells of the MERS\u2010CoV infection in the lung include pneumocytes, multinucleated epithelial cells, and bronchial submucosal gland cells.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] All of these cells express a multifunctional cell surface protein, called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26), constituting the primary entry receptor of MERS\u2010CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] Ultrastructurally, viral particles were found in the pneumocytes, pulmonary macrophages, macrophages infiltrating the skeletal muscles, and renal proximal tubular epithelial cells.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Consistent with the ultrastructural findings in the kidney, renal biopsies demonstrated acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and acute tubular sclerosis with proteinaceous cast formation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]",
            "DPP4, the entry receptor of MERS\u2010CoV, is widely expressed on epithelial cells in the kidney, alveoli, small intestine, liver, prostate, and on activated leukocytes,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>] suggesting that the range of MERS\u2010 CoV tissue tropism is broader than that of any other coronavirus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] Accordingly, MERS\u2010CoV was found to be able to infect many human immune cells, including dendritic cells,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] macrophages,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] and T cells.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] MERS\u2010CoV infections of DCs and macrophages result in robust and sustained production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106, CXCL\u201010, CCL\u20102, CCL\u20103, CCL\u20105, and IL\u20108.29,30 Proinflammatory and immune\u2010attracting capacities of these cytokines are thought to cause (or at least contribute to) immune cell infiltration into the lower respiratory tract of infected patients and the observed severe inflammation as well as tissue damage.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] MERS\u2010CoV infections of T cells results in apoptosis mediated by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] Through this mechanism, MERS\u2010CoV evades the T cell response in the",
            "|3 peripheral blood and lymphoid organs, which may contribute to virus spread and the severe immunopathology.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] Moreover, it has been reported that MERS\u2010CoV can also induce apoptosis of both kidney and lung cells through upregulation of Smad[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]",
            "Approximately 1 month after the onset of the outbreak, several virological and clinical aspects of the 2019\u2010nCoV and associated disease are still under investigation. However, the field is rapidly moving forward. Nevertheless, findings from several reports await independent confirmation and have to be regarded with precautions.",
            "The genome of 2019\u2010nCov was sequenced very early during the outbreak.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] This enabled rapid development of point\u2010of\u2010care real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction diagnostic tests specific for 2019\u2010nCoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] The genetic sequence analysis revealed that the 2019\u2010nCoV belongs to the \u03b2\u2010coronavirus genus, with a 79.0% nucleotide identity to SARS\u2010CoV and 51.8% identity to MERS\u2010 CoV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] Furthermore, it has been reported that nCoV\u20102019 is 96% identical across the entire genome to a bat coronavirus.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>] Inoculation of the 2019\u2010nCoV onto surface layers of human airway epithelial cells in vitro causes cytopathic effects and cessation of the cilium beating of the cells.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] The 2019\u2010nCoV infection was of clustering onset that is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] The major clinical symptoms resulting from 2019\u2010nCoV infection at the prodromal phase include fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue, and diarrhea.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] Many patients also developed dyspnea and lymphopenia. Complications of 2019\u2010nCoV infections included acute respiratory distress syndrome, RNAaemia, acute cardiac injury, and secondary (super\u2010)infections.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] All reported cases, including asymptomatic patients, had abnormal findings concerning the chest computed tomography (CT) as indicated by bilateral ground\u2010glass opacity.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] The prototypical findings of chest CT images of seriously ill patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] Initial plasma IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20101R\u03b1, IL\u20107, IL\u20108, IL\u20109, IL\u201010, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN\u03b3, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations were higher in 2019\u2010nCoV\u2010infected patients as compared to healthy controls. Moreover, ICU patients showed higher plasma levels of IL\u20102, IL\u20107, IL\u201010, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 than non\u2010ICU patients.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>] These results suggest that immunopathology may also play a relevant role in the development of disease severity."

        "7 | SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK": [
            "The comprehensive lessons learned from the SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010 CoV outbreaks provide, despite their inherent tragedy, valuable experiences and insights into how to fight the 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic.",
            "Drugs which inhibit viral dissemination and disrupt viral replication may reduce the coronavirus\u2010induced direct cytopathic effects, and treatments which restrain host inflammatory responses (eg, by antibodies or compounds neutralizing cytokines or their cognate receptors, such as anti\u2010IL\u20106, anti\u2010IL\u20106R, or anti\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2), ideally in the respiratory tract only, may reduce virus\u2010triggered immune\u2010 pathologies. We infer that a combination of such treatments would be the most suitable therapeutic strategy for more severe human coronavirus infections. However, we must bear in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS, MERS, and 2019\u2010 nCoV, and therefore further research into the pathogenesis of human coronavirus infection is imperative for identifying appropriate therapeutic targets."

            "These outbreaks result from zoonotic coronavirus crossing the species barrier and causing high morbidity and mortality in human populations.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] The 2019\u2010nCoV, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV show several similarities regarding the clinical presentations, which can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] the current knowledge of the biology and pathology of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV may provide clues for ongoing and future research efforts concerning the investigation of the 2019\u2010nCoV.",
            "The authors try to apply the current understanding of the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV for the characterization of 2019\u2010nCoV"
        ],
        "Conclusion": [
            "Drugs which inhibit viral dissemination and disrupt viral replication may reduce the coronavirus\u2010induced direct cytopathic effects, and treatments which restrain host inflammatory responses, ideally in the respiratory tract only, may reduce virus\u2010triggered immune\u2010 pathologies.",
            "The authors infer that a combination of such treatments would be the most suitable therapeutic strategy for more severe human coronavirus infections.",
            "The authors must bear in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS, MERS, and 2019\u2010 nCoV, and further research into the pathogenesis of human coronavirus infection is imperative for identifying appropriate therapeutic targets"
