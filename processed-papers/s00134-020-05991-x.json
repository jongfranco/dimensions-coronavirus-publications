The results obtained from this study also suggest that COVID-19 mortality might be due to virus-activated \u201ccytokine storm syndrome\u201d or fulminant myocarditis."

Patients met the discharge criteria if they had no fever for at least 3 days, significantly improved respiratory function, and had negative SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results twice in succession. Case data included demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory results, treatment options and outcomes.
