            "In Chapter 17, Chan Su Jung and Seeun Ryu review PSM (public service motivation)-related studies conducted in the South Korean context from various angles, including antecedents and consequences of PSM and modifiers between the two, modifying effects of PSM, dimensions and measurements of PSM, and static and dynamic characteristics of PSM and their practical implications. Based on the literature review, Jung and Ryu discuss the strengths and less researched areas in South Korean PSM studies as well as practical aspects including the current government\u2019s efforts relevant to PSM in South Korea."
