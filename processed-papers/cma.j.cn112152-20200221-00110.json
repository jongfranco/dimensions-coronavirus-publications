            "The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly. In order to prevent cluster outbreaks, the government strengthened the management and control of personnel mobility, which had a great impact on the examination and treatment of breast cancer patients. This paper discusses how to realize scientific health management of breast cancer patients outside the hospital based on the existing epidemic situation, characteristics of breast cancer patients and public health safety factors. The breast cancer patients should synthetically consider the epidemic prevention situation of inhabitance, the disease stage and previous therapeutic schedule to decide the next therapeutic schedule. If necessary, after professional discussion and communication between doctors and patients online or offline, the hospital visiting time should be delayed through seeking alternative treatment schemes, and psychological counseling for patients should be paid attention to at the same time."
