        "abstract": "Epidemic and pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to human populations worldwide. Iridoid glycosides are principal bioactive components from the Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis fruit that exhibit antiviral activity against several strains of IAV. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effect of Fructus Gardeniae iridoid glycoside extracts (IGEs) against IAV by cytopathogenic effect(CPE), MTT and a plaque formation assay in vitro and examined the reduction in the pulmonary index (PI), restoration of body weight, reduction in mortality and increases in survival time in vivo. As a host factor, PACT provides protection against the pathogenic influenza A virus by interacting with IAV polymerase and activating the IFN-I response. To verify the whether IGEs suppress IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner, IAV RNA replication, expression of PACT and the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in A549 cells were detected; the levels of IFN\u03b2, PACT and PKR in mouse lung tissues were determined; and the activity of IAV polymerase was evaluated in PACT-compromised cells. The results indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protecting mice from IAV-induced injury and lethal IAV infection. These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between IVA polymerase and PACT and/or prevention of a PACT-dependent overactivated IFN-I antiviral response. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the mechanisms by which IGEs fight the influenza A virus in a PACT-dependent manner.",

            "In conclusion, our research indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protected the lung tissues from IAV-induced injury in mice models of influenza-induced pneumonia and rescued mice from lethal IAV infection. These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between the IVA polymerase and the cellular double-stranded RNA-binding protein PACT, which prevents the overactivation of the PACT-dependent IFN-I antiviral response induced by IAV infection. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the mechanism of IGEs action against the influenza A virus, for which it inhibited IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner. The current study might pave the way for the development of new antiviral agents against IAV."

Especially in infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems, influenza is likely to cause serious complications; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified influenza as a major public health problem[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. Furthermore, emergence and spread of new high pathogenic influenza variants have posed a critical challenges to the global health and include swine-origin H1N1, H5N8, H9N2, and H7N95\u20138. In China, a novel H7N9 avian influenza virus caused 5 nationwide outbreaks from January 2013 to June 20179. It was estimated that the average risk of fatality associated with H7N9 infection is approximately 40%10, which is much higher than that of SARS(11%)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",
            "Although of viral neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors and M2 ion channel blockers are widely used for treatment[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], some serious side effects and low efficacy have been reported, and the emergence of drug resistant strains is increasing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) which is composed of three subunits, PA, PB1 and PB2, is a very promising alternative target for novel anti-influenza drug discovery research because it is essential for the transcription and replication of virus genes and is conserved among different types of influenza viruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. During transcription, RdRP synthesizes capped and polyadenylated mRNA using 5\u2032 capped RNA primers. During replication, RdRP generates a complementary RNA (cRNA) replication intermediate, which serves as a template for the synthesis of new copies of viral RNA (vRNA)[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]."

Five days after the mice were inoculated with influenza virus A/FM1/47, the levels of IFN\u03b2, PACT and PKR were remarkably more pronounced.

In the mouse model of IAV pneumonia, IGEs exhibited an inhibitory effect on the pulmonary index, which indicated that the IGEs protected the lung tissues from influenza-induced injury.

            "To verify the activation of PACT and eIF2\u03b1 induced by IAV infection, we measured PACT expression and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in infected A549 cells 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-infection. In the current study, PACT",
            "The level of PACT.",
            "expression in the A549 cells increased significantly 24, 36, and 48 h after IAV infection. In addition, the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in the A549 cells was dramatically increased 24, 36, and 48 h after IAV infection. The results demonstrated that IAV infection led to a PACT response and activated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, findings in",
            "general agreement with a previous report[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>]. Furthermore, IGEs treatment markedly inhibited PACT expression in a dose-dependent manner at the three measurement time points post- infection. Interestingly, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was significantly suppressed by IGEs treatment at four time points. These results indicated that the overactivation of PACT and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation induced by IAV was suppressed by IGEs treatment, which provides evidence that IGEs exert anti-IAV activity by inhibiting the overactivation of the PACT-dependent innate immune response.",
            "PACT has been identified as an antiviral host factor that interacts with IAV polymerase. The interaction between PACT and IAV polymerase plays a pivotal role in the outcome of virus infection and antiviral immune response. It has been demonstrated that PACT-dependent activation of IFN\u03b2 production was inhibited by all three subunits of IAV polymerase[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>]. In an RNP reconstitution assay, knocking down PACT in IAV-infected A549 cells enhanced vRNA production and the subsequent IFN response[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. Of interest, there might be interplay between PACT and other viral molecules, such as the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) Us11 protein, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 4a and the nucleocapsid of the Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) N proteins and influenza A virus NS160\u201363. Hence, PACT might be a common target to counteract innate immunity response induced by different viruses with the potential to be developed into a new broad-spectrum antiviral drug.",
            "To further investigate whether IGEs suppresses IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner, PACT was compromised by siRNA in HEK-293T cells that had been co-transfected with four plasmids containing NP, PA, PB1 and PB2. According to the results of the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, the HEK-293T cells transfected with only with pFlu-luc showed very low relative luciferase activity for the IAV RNA polymerase. In contrast, cells co-transfected with plasmids containing NP, PA, PB1, PB2 and Flu-luc showed relatively high RNA polymerase activity. Of note, our results indicated that knocking down PACT enhanced IAV polymerase activity, a finding that was consistent with that of a previous study. Hence, virus replication that was catalysed by IAV polymerase was enhanced by compromising the action of PACT, which was identified as an antiviral host factor. In addition, IGEs treatment at doses of 320 and 160 \u03bcg/ml showed a relatively weak suppressive effect on IAV polymerase activity in the PACT-knockdown HEK-293T cells. Collectively, the data from the current study demonstrated that IGEs treatment might inhibit IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner.",
            "In conclusion, our research indicated that IGEs sufficiently alleviated cell damage and suppressed IAV replication in vitro, protected the lung tissues from IAV-induced injury in mice models of influenza-induced pneumonia and rescued mice from lethal IAV infection. These anti-IAV effects might be related to disrupted interplay between the IVA polymerase and the cellular double-stranded RNA-binding protein PACT, which prevents the overactivation of the PACT-dependent IFN-I antiviral response induced by IAV infection. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the mechanism of IGEs action against the influenza A virus, for which it inhibited IAV replication in a PACT-dependent manner. The current study might pave the way for the development of new antiviral agents against IAV."
