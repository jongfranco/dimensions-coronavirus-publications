In particular, for almost all cases, an exposition to the Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was found and, thus, the market was considered the most probable source of the virus outbreak [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Chinese health authorities have taken prompt public health measures, including intensive surveillance, epidemiological investigations, and closure of the market on 1 January, 2020 (Figure 1).",

This virus has been detected as the causative agent for 15 of the 59 pneumonia cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].",
            "From that date, an increasing number of studies have been published and several international institutions (World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) have provided findings supporting a rapid increase in the general knowledge. However, despite these significant improved data, many questions about the new coronavirus remain, and answers could be strategic for programming and designing public health interventions."
