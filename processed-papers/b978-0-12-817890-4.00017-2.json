        "abstract": "Marine environment is a home to a very wide diversity of flora and fauna, which includes an array of genetically diverse coastline and under seawater plant species, animal species, microbial species, their habitats, ecosystems, and supporting ecological processes. The Earth is home to an estimated 10 million species, of which a large chunk belongs to marine environment. Marine plants are a store house of a variety of antimicrobial compounds like classes of marine flavonoids\u2014flavones and flavonols, terpenoids, alkaloids, peptides, carbohydrates, fatty acids, polyketides, polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, and steroids. Lot of research today is directed toward marine species, which have proved to be a potent source of structurally widely diverse and yet highly bioactive secondary metabolites. Varied species of phylum Porifera, algae including diatoms, Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta, Dinoflagellata, Chrysophyta, cyanobacteria, Rhodophyta, and Phaeophyta, bacteria, fungi, and weeds have been exploited by mankind for their inherent indigenous biological antimicrobial compounds, produced under the extreme stressful underwater conditions of temperature, atmospheric pressure, light, and nutrition. The present study aims at presenting a brief review of bioactive marine compounds possessing antimicrobial potency.",
