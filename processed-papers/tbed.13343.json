We found the attack rate was 61% (50/82) among piglets in the nomadic pig herd, and the case fatality rate was 20% (10/50) among piglets with diarrhoea. All study piglets cases had watery diarrhoea, lack of appetite or reluctance to move. A novel RVA strain with a new P[49] genotype combined with G4 was identified among all piglets with diarrhoea.
