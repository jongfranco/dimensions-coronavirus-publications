            "The health response in China has been impressive, if at times it appears severe\u2014shutting down exit and entry into cities, strict isolation, and bans on certain categories of contact. But to attack the root causes of this outbreak will require reducing risks of animal-to-human transmission. That will mean a concerted effort to close the sources of virus transmission\u2014poorly hygienic animal wet markets. To do so will demand a huge cultural shift in",
            "Chinese society, one that should not be underestimated, but one that is essential if this type of outbreak is to be prevented in the future. To safeguard their own citizens, as well as to strengthen global health security, Chinese political leaders must clearly state their commitment to eradicating these markets.",
            "There has been an understandable focus on containing the spread of 2019-nCoV. But less attention has been given to the need for sufficient clinical capacity to deliver care to infected individuals. The viral pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV can be extremely severe. In the first reports of patients with 2019-nCoV, a third required admission to intensive care, with the majority developing adult respiratory distress syndrome. Even high-income countries with technically advanced health systems would struggle to provide the necessary care to potentially large numbers of patients with severe complications of 2019-nCoV. China has a well developed hospital system, but the surge capacity for intensive care will be limited. What can Chinese authorities do, together with the international medical community, to expand acute medical services, including the supply of skilled hospital staff, to meet the needs of infected patients? This question is urgent.",
            "In 2003, when SARS struck, China\u2019s health research system was fragmented and poorly coordinated. Not so today. China\u2019s science community has reacted with speed and skill to investigate and report in real time the ongoing outbreak, providing critical public health, clinical, and virological data to guide the national and global response. Research is sometimes seen as a luxury when countries are being urged to invest in basic primary health care. But the 2019-nCoV outbreak has shown the foundational importance of research for any effective public health response. When this latest outbreak has been contained, WHO, with the support of member states, must redouble its efforts to make health research an integral part of universal health coverage. The 2019-nCoV outbreak proves that health research saves lives."
