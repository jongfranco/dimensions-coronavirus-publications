        "journal": "Poultry Science",
        "abstract": "In poultry, viral infections (e.g., Marek's disease virus, avian leukosis virus, influenza A virus, and so on) can cause devastating mortality and economic losses. Because viruses are solely dependent on host cells to propagate, they alter the host intracellular microenvironment. Thus, understanding the virus-host interaction is important for antiviral immunity and drug development in the poultry industry. MicroRNAs are crucial posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in a wide spectrum of biological processes, including viral infection. Recently, microRNAs have been identified as key players in virus-host interactions. In this review, we will discuss the intricacies involved in the virus-host cross-talk mediated by host and viral microRNAs in poultry (i.e., chicken and ducks), as well as recent trends and challenges in this field. These findings may provide some insights into the rapidly developing area of research regarding viral pathogenesis and antiviral immunity in poultry production.",
