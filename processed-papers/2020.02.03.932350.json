        "abstract": "As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (renamed to COVID-19) spread to 30 countries with 2130 deaths and more than 75500 confirmed cases. COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.",

For the clusters with more than 500 sequences, we selected 500 sequences at random. Our method can handle all of the available 14668 sequences, but using imbalanced clusters, in regard to the number of sequences, can introduce an unwanted bias.

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period.",
            "Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification."

This problem being time-sensitive requires quick sequence similarity comparison against thousands of known sequences to narrow down the candidates of possible origin. Alignment-based methods are known to be time-consuming and can be challenging in cases where homologous sequence continuity cannot be ensured. It is challenging (and sometimes impossible) for alignment-based methods to compare a large number of sequences that are too different in their composition. Alignment-free methods have been used successfully in the past to address the limitations of the alignment-based methods [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>]. The alignment-free approach is quick and can handle a large number of sequences. Moreover, even the sequences coming from different regions with different compositions can be easily compared quantitatively, with equally meaningful results as when comparing homologous/similar sequences.

There is only one realm available in the viral taxonomy, so all of the families that belong to the realm Riboviria are placed into a single cluster and a random collection of 500 sequences are selected. No realm is defined for the remaining 11 families. The objective is to train the classification models with the known viral genomes and then predict the labels of the COVID-19 virus sequences. The maximum classification accuracy score of 95% was obtained using the Quadratic SVM model. This test demonstrates that MLDSP-GUI can distinguish between different viral families. The trained models are then used to predict the labels of 29 COVID-19 sequences. As expected, all classification models correctly predict that the COVID-19 sequences belong to the Riboviria realm, see Table 2. Test-2 is composed of 12 families from the Riboviria, see Table 1, and the goal is to test if MLDSP-GUI is sensitive enough to classify the sequences at the next lower taxonomic level. It should be noted that as we move down the taxonomic levels, sequences become much more similar to one another and the classification problem becomes challenging. MLDSP-GUI is still able to distinguish between the sequences within the Riboviria realm with a maximum classification accuracy of 91.1% obtained using the Linear Discriminant classification model.

We use this method to provide evidence for the taxonomic classification of COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus, as well as quantitative evidence supporting a bat origin hypothesis. Our results are obtained through a comprehensive analysis of over 5000 unique viral sequences, through an alignment-free analysis of their two-dimensional genomic signatures, combined with a \u201cdecision tree\u201d use of supervised machine learning and confirmed by Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient analyses. This study suggests that such alignment-free approaches to comparative genomics can be used to complement alignment-based approaches when timely taxonomic classification is of the essence, such as at critical periods during novel viral outbreaks.",
