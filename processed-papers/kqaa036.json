            "Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses found in mammals, birds and humans. At present, six coronavirus species are known agents for illnesses in humans. Four viruses\u2014229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1\u2014are prevalent and can cause respiratory symptoms. The other two\u2014 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)\u2014are zoonotic in origin and can cause fatalities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>].",
            "SARS-CoV originated in Guangdong Province, China and was responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003. It rapidly spread across the globe and resulted in 8098 reported cases and 774 deaths (case-fatality rate, 9.6%) in 37 countries. MERS-CoV originated in the Middle East and caused severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012. Since 2012, there have been 2494 reported MERS-CoV cases resulting in 858 deaths (case-fatality rate, 34%) in 27 countries. There were also several rapid outbreaks reported, mainly in hospitals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and South Korea [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]."

            "aThe case no. denotes the order of cases according to the time of announcement by the Ministry of Health, Singapore. The first 18 cases were imported cases. bTwo other cases (Cases 52 and 56) were reported from the same worksite 2 days later.",
            "the 1035 crew on the liner Diamond Princess, which is currently docked in Yokohama with around 3600 people quarantined since 3 February 2020. A Hong Kong man boarded the ship on 20 January in Yokohama at the beginning of a 14-day round trip cruise. The passenger sailed from Yokohama to Hong Kong, where he disembarked on 25 January. The ship continued its journey, until news was received that the passenger tested positive on 1 February 2020. The Diamond Princess returned to Yokohama a day early, and has been quarantined since then, with guests isolated in their cabins and screened [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The quarantine period will end on 19 February 2020. Another cruise ship, the Dutch liner Westerdam, sailed out of Hong Kong on 1 February 2020. It was turned away by the Philippines, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Thailand and the US territory of Guam, because of fears arising from the COVID-19 outbreak\u2014even though there was apparently no confirmed case on board [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. The ship was finally allowed to dock in Sihanoukville, Cambodia after 13 days at sea.",
            "Besides fears of contagion from people on board cruise ships, which have been likened to \u2018floating petri dishes\u2019, fears are also widespread on land. There are increasing reports of HCWs being shunned and harassed by a fearful public because of their occupation.",
            "A Member of Parliament in Singapore highlighted what he termed as \u2018disgraceful actions\u2019 against HCWs stemming from fear and panic [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Some examples of behaviour described were: Taxi drivers reluctant to pick up staff in medical uniform.",
            "A healthcare professional\u2019s private-hire vehicle cancelled because she was going to a hospital.",
            "A nurse in a lift asked why she was not taking the stairs and that she was spreading the virus to others by taking the lift.",
            "A nurse scolded for making the Mass Rapid Transit train \u201cdirty\u201d and spreading the virus.",
            "An ambulance driver turned away by food stall workers.",
            "However, not all the reactions from the public towards HCWs have been negative. There are probably an equal number of stories of public support and encouragement. Members of the public have showed their appreciation for HCWs and have volunteered to help the more vulnerable in society [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. For example, a ride-hailing transport operator started a new service offering a dedicated 24-h service for HCWs travelling from work. Volunteers have also stepped forward to distribute hand sanitizers and masks to the elderly and vulnerable in their community, while sharing important public health messages.",
            "Such reactions are reminiscent of behaviour during the 2003 SARS outbreak, where not only the general public, but even close family members were afraid of being infected by HCWs exposed to the disease. A survey of over 10 000 HCWs in Singapore during the SARS outbreak of 2003 reported that many respondents experienced social stigmatization. Almost half (49%) thought that \u2018people avoid me because of my job\u2019 and 31% felt that \u2018people avoid my family members because of my job\u2019. For example, some parents of schoolchildren forbade their children to play or be close to children of HCWs. A large number (69%) of HCWs also felt that \u2018people close to me are worried they might get infected through me\u2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. On the other hand, there was also massive public support for HCWs, who were hailed as heroes in the fight against the disease. Most of the HCWs (77%) felt appreciated by society.",
            "COVID-19 is the first new occupational disease to be described in this decade. Our experiences in coping with the previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks have better prepared us to face this new challenge. While the explosive increase in cases in China has overwhelmed the health care system initially, we know that public health measures such as early detection, quarantine and isolation of cases can be effective in containing the outbreak. All health personnel should be alert to the risk of COVID-19 in a wide variety of occupations, and",
            "not only HCWs. These occupational groups can be protected by good infection control practices. These at-risk groups should also be given adequate social and mental health support [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], which are needed but which are sometimes overlooked."
