Quarantine is movement restriction, often with fever surveillance, of contacts when it is not evident whether they have been infected but are not yet symptomatic or have not been infected. Community containment includes measures that range from increasing social distancing to community-wide quarantine. Whether these measures will be sufficient to control 2019-nCoV depends on addressing some unanswered questions.",

            "The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 quickly spread within Hubei province and has now reached all provinces in China and was exported to >20 countries by 30 January 2020. 2019-nCoV is thought to be primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets with a similar incubation time and generation time as SARS coronavirus (SARSCoV).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] SARS was frightening at the time, maybe even more frightening compared to 2019-nCoV (now renamed COVID-19) given its much more frequent progression to severe disease and death.

            "We are yet again faced with a situation of an outbreak with a closely related virus for which we currently have no specific therapeutics or vaccines. Again, we need to rely on classical public health measures to curb the epidemic of this respiratory disease. The primary goal of such public health measures is to prevent person-to-person spread of disease by separating people to interrupt transmission. The tools we have at hand are isolation and quarantine, social distancing and community containment. All these tools are currently being employed at an unprecedented massive scale in China. Here we define these tools, explain how they are being used to control the novel coronavirus, and elaborate on the benefits and challenges."

            "To reduce intermixing of unidentified infected persons with non-infected community members.",
            "Effective for infectious diseases with high person-to-person transmission where peak transmission occurs when patients have symptoms Quarantining is most successful in settings where detection of cases is prompt, contacts can be traced within a short time frame with prompt issuance of quarantine",
            "Social distancing is particularly useful in settings where community transmission is substantial",
            "Quarantined persons will need psychological support, food and water, and household and medical supplies",
            "Ethical principles and codes are needed to guide community containment practice and policy Community containment to protect the population\u2019s health potentially conflicts with individual rights of liberty and self-determination",
            "Financial compensation for work days lost should be considered Voluntary is preferred over mandatory quarantine, but law enforcement may need to be considered if quarantine violations occur frequently Law enforcement is needed in most settings. Therefore such restrictive interventions should be limited to the actual level of risk to the community coronavirus. Given the trajectory of this outbreak, it is now a matter of whether we are able to scale up such efforts to keep pace with the rapid increase of cases and geographical spread.",
            "Whether these rigorous measures will result in the same victory as for SARS depends on the following questions that currently remain unanswered: (i) what is the proportion of subclinical disease (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) that would be missed by the case definition, hence not be identified and immediately isolated, and therefore contribute to community transmission? (ii) On what day of illness is peak viral shedding, and how much viral shedding occurs before onset of symptoms? (iii) Does viral shedding occur also beyond respiratory droplets, e.g. via fomites? (iv) What is the true case fatality rate if the denominator also takes milder cases into account?",
            "The answers to these questions will drive the response. Preliminary insights from clusters in Vietnam and Germany unveil that even mildly symptomatic persons may contribute to transmission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] If this is indeed more frequent, then old-style public health measures will not be sufficient and we need to await vaccines to halt the epidemic.",
            "The initial case fatality rate was reported to be 15%, but the initial cases were biased towards the severe end of the disease, with rapidly rising cases, it is now thought to be around 2\u20133%. Until we understand the full clinical spectrum of the disease, we will not know the case fatality rate. What we do know is that disease severity does not drive transmissibility. Although the case fatality rate may be far lower than that of SARSCoV, the greatest concern could be that this novel virus behaves epidemiologically like influenza viruses, will defy all old-style public health measures, and turn into a pandemic with many more deaths than SARS."

        "The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 quickly spread within Hubei province and has now reached all provinces in China and was exported to >20 countries by 30 January 2020. 2019-nCoV is thought to be primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets with a similar incubation time and generation time as SARS coronavirus (SARSCoV).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] SARS was frightening at the time, maybe even more frightening compared to 2019-nCoV given its much more frequent progression to severe disease and death",

        "Given the trajectory of this outbreak, it is a matter of whether we are able to scale up such efforts to keep pace with the rapid increase of cases and geographical spread. Whether these rigorous measures will result in the same victory as for SARS depends on the following questions that currently remain unanswered: (i) what is the proportion of subclinical disease that would be missed by the case definition, not be identified and immediately isolated, and contribute to community transmission? On what day of illness is peak viral shedding, and how much viral shedding occurs before onset of symptoms? Does viral shedding occur beyond respiratory droplets, e.g. via fomites? What is the true case fatality rate if the denominator takes milder cases into account?",
        "The case fatality rate may be far lower than that of SARS coronavirus, the greatest concern could be that this novel virus behaves epidemiologically like influenza viruses, will defy all old-style public health measures, and turn into a pandemic with many more deaths than SARS"
