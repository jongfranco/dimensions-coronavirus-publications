        "abstract": "The most severe sequelae after rehabilitation from SARS are femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. We performed a 15-year follow-up on the lung and bone conditions of SARS patients. We evaluated the recovery from lung damage and femoral head necrosis in an observational cohort study of SARS patients using pulmonary CT scans, hip joint MRI examinations, pulmonary function tests and hip joint function questionnaires. Eighty medical staff contracted SARS in 2003. Two patients died of SARS, and 78 were enrolled in this study from August 2003 to March 2018. Seventy-one patients completed the 15-year follow-up. The percentage of pulmonary lesions on CT scans diminished from 2003 (9.40 \u00b1 7.83)% to 2004 (3.20 \u00b1 4.78)% (P < 0.001) and remained stable thereafter until 2018 (4.60 \u00b1 6.37)%. Between 2006 and 2018, the proportion of patients with interstitial changes who had improved pulmonary function was lower than that of patients without lesions, as demonstrated by the one-second ratio (FEV1/FVC %, t = 2.21, P = 0.04) and mid-flow of maximum expiration (FEF25%\u201375%, t = 2.76, P = 0.01). The volume of femoral head necrosis decreased significantly from 2003 (38.83 \u00b1 21.01)% to 2005 (30.38 \u00b1 20.23)% (P = 0.000 2), then declined slowly from 2005 to 2013 (28.99 \u00b1 20.59)% and plateaued until 2018 (25.52 \u00b1 15.51)%. Pulmonary interstitial damage and functional decline caused by SARS mostly recovered, with a greater extent of recovery within 2 years after rehabilitation. Femoral head necrosis induced by large doses of steroid pulse therapy in SARS patients was not progressive and was partially reversible.",

We acquired CT scans by using a GE 64-slice Light Speed CT scanner and GE 256-slice Revolution scanner. A high-resolution multislice spiral CT scan from the apex to the base of the lung was obtained with the patient holding their breath at the end of maximal inspiration.

The pulmonary function test parameters were compared between the normal CT findings group (N = 22) and the abnormal CT findings group (N = 13). The results are shown in Table 2, and there were no substantial changes in pulmonary function in the abnormal CT finding group in the past few years.

            "Ruuskanen et al reported that ~200 million people worldwide develop viral pneumonia each year.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] In the past 10 years, apart from SARS coronavirus, avian influenza virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus periodically had outbreaks, and the pulmonary images of viral pneumonia usually presented with multileaf interstitial changes, ground glass opacities and consolidation; however, antibiotics were ineffective for treating these conditions.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] Conventional views dictated that viral pneumonia was self-limiting. Das et al followed up 55 patients with MERS pneumonia, analyzed imaging variations within 1 year after rehabilitation, and found that the most common type of lesion was ground-glass changes in the periphery of the lung.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Chen et al followed up 56 patients with H7N9 avian influenza to analyze pulmonary function and imaging changes within 2 years after infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] The results showed that despite interstitial changes and fibrosis on imaging, ventilation and diffusion dysfunction improved to some extent after 6 months; however, recovered patients experienced impaired pulmonary function over those 2 years. In a cohort of 48 H1N1 pneumonia cases, Liu et al found that patients who showed mild to moderate pulmonary dysfunction manifested with diffusion disorder (33.3%) and small airway dysfunction (33.3%).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] Wu et al at the Beijing Friendship Hospital found that the lesions on CT scans of 11 SARS patients both 6 months and 84 months after rehabilitation clearly diminished compared with those seen at 3 months.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] Ground-glass opacity (GGO) lesions were dominant at 6 months, while intralobular and interlobular septum thickening were prominent at 84 months.",

Ong et al evaluated the pulmonary function and health utility of 94 patients 1 year after being rehabilitated from SARS.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] The outcomes showed that 63% of the patients maintained normal lung function, with slightly reduced FEV1/FVC values in 5% of patients and moderately a reduced FVC value in one case. Of these patients, 18% and 3% had mildly and moderately impaired diffusion function, respectively.",
            "To date, no imaging data of lung injury in SARS patients have been reported internationally with a follow-up period of over 5 years. We conducted a cohort study of 80 healthcare workers who were infected with nosocomial SARS at Peking University People\u2019s Hospital in 2003. With radiology examinations, we distinguished GGO and strip-like consolidation on CT scans and calculated the percentage of areas with different lesions. Our study is the first to describe the recovery curve of lung injury in SARS patients over the past 15 years. We found that the percentage of lesions rapidly decreased from 2003 to 2004 and plateaued from 2004 to 2018. These results suggest that SARS-induced pulmonary lesions visualized with imaging recovered to a greater extent within 1 year after rehabilitation. These results indicated that there was a correlation between pulmonary CT images and functional changes. Thus far, there has been no report on the pulmonary function in SARS patients during a follow-up period of over 2 years on the global scale. Our study showed that the pulmonary function in 2018 was basically the same as that in 2006, with mildly impaired diffusion function. Although there was no substantial recovery, we should take the natural degeneration of pulmonary function over the past 15 years into consideration. In addition, the pulmonary function of patients who had normal findings on CT after recovering from SARS in 2003 was substantially better than that of patients with abnormalities. This implies that pulmonary function could be improved to a larger extent when the acute phase of infectious viral pneumonia is effectively managed. This finding has great value in judging and predicting the prognosis of viral pneumonia.",
            "Previous studies have reported that subchondral osteonecrosis occurred in 5%\u201310% of patients with SARS according to MRI scans after systemic steroid treatment and that the cumulative steroid dose was a risk factor for osteonecrosis.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] However, the longterm outcomes of osteonecrosis resulting from high-dose steroids were unavailable. Our study, as far as we know, is the first to report that the status of femoral head necrosis caused by high-dose steroid pulse therapy to treat infectious viral pneumonia could remain stable over the long term and that femoral head necrosis could even become reversible. This phenomena clearly differs from the progression of femoral head necrosis caused by longterm steroid administration for other diseases (e.g., leukemia, nephrotic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] Despite limited weight-bearing protocols and having an improved blood supply, femoral head necrosis induced by long-term steroid administration for leukemia, nephropathy and rheumatoid arthritis was always progressive and irreversible and ultimately led to worsened necrosis and subsequent collapse of the femoral head.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] Loss of joint function and arthritis were inevitable consequences. ARCO stage II femoral head necrosis progressed to stage III over a followup ranging from 2 months to 3 years (average 17 months), collapsed within 3\u201316 months (average 11 months), and progressed to stage IV with arthritis within 6 years.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] Shimuzu et al reported that it took an average of 33 months to progress from stage I lesions to stage III and 49 months from stage I to stage IV.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] Wei et al reported that steroid-induced femoral head necrosis in stage I progressed to stage IV after 24 months.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]",
            "In our study, femoral head necrosis occurred in 23 limbs from 15 SARS patients (15/71) and was presumed to be closely related to short-term high-dose steroid therapy and had little direct relation with the SARS-CoV infection. Our study is the first to describe the variation curve of femoral head necrosis of SARS patients over a period of 15 years by measuring the volume on continuous MRI images. The results showed that the volume of osteonecrosis in 15 patients substantially decreased, demonstrating an overall tendency toward improvement. Over the past 15 years, femoral head necrosis in the cohort recovered rapidly between 2003 and 2005, with a slower pace between 2005 and 2012, and reached a plateau from 2012 to 2018. The hip function questionnaire showed that 29 (72.5%) patients remained stable over 15 years, with limited hip function in seven (17.5%) patients, while four (10%) developed arthritis accompanied with poor mobility. These outcomes show that the limited hip joint function progressed slowly. Femoral head necrosis also lessened to some extent, and correspondingly, the patients\u2019 hip joint function was generally stable over the past 15 years.",

            "These results aid in understanding the natural course of pulmonary recovery after viral infection and femoral head necrosis induced by high-dose steroids. These findings have profound implications for physician understanding of clinical steroid therapy."

        "METHODS": [
            "All 78 surviving SARS patients at Peking University People\u2019s Hospital were included in our observational study from August 2003 to March 2018. The patients underwent pulmonary CT scans and hip joint MRI scans annually from 2003 to 2018 and pulmonary function tests in 2006 and 2018. Due to the uniqueness of SARS patients, the decision to undergo physical examinations and imaging entirely depended on the patients\u2019 choices.",
            "We calculated the percentage of area with GGO lesions and strip-like consolidations on chest CT scans and analyzed the variation curve of the proportions. We acquired CT scans by using a GE 64-slice Light Speed CT scanner and GE 256-slice Revolution scanner. A high-resolution multislice spiral CT scan from the apex to the base of the lung was obtained with the patient holding their breath at the end of maximal inspiration. The slice thickness was 10 mm (2003\u20132005) or 0.625 mm (after 2005). Two physicians with more than 5 years of experience in chest CT review analyzed a 80",
            "We performed pulmonary function tests via an automatic pulmonary function testing system (master screen-pft manufactured by Jaeger, Germany) in 2006 and 2018. The main parameters included TLC, residual volume (RV), FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and forced expiratory flow at 25%\u201375% of the pulmonary volume (FEF25%\u201375%). We measured the DLCO using the single-breath method. FEV1/FVC <70% was defined as obstructive ventilation dysfunction, TLC <80% of the predicted value indicated restrictive ventilation dysfunction, DLCO <80% of the predicted value indicated reduced lung diffusion capacity, and a value <65% of the predicted value defined impaired FEF25%\u201375% values.",
            "We calculated the percentage of volume with osteonecrosis in the femoral head and analyzed its variation at various time points.",
            "Consecutive coronal T1WI images were sent to a picture archiving and communication system to measure the volume of the femoral head with necrosis. On the basis of the unique feature of femoral head necrosis, we used the serpiginous low signal band as the",
            "margin, confirmed the inner side as the necrotic area, and calculated the percentage of volume with osteonecrosis as (necrotic volume/femoral head volume)\u00d7100%. We used the ARCO stage classification standard to assess the clinical femoral head necrosis stage.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>] We also performed a general condition survey and assessed hip joint function with the Harris score in March 2018 via questionnaire.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]",
            "To avoid potential judgment bias, we ensured that each person was imaged with the same CT and MRI system during follow-up. The standardized image judging, data extraction, data processing, and calculation process were performed by different research groups. Three senior radiologists, two senior orthopedic surgeons, and two senior respiratory physicians confirmed the pathological judgment standard based on imaging. Imaging data analysis was independently performed and averaged by three senior radiologists. Two professional statisticians independently performed the data processing and calculation processes.",

            "Statistical methods We used numbers and percentages to present categorical variables and mean \u00b1 SD or median (P25, P75) to present continuous variables. We used the two-sample t test or Satterthwaite t test to compare the lung function variables between patients who had abnormal CT and normal CT findings. We use the mixed-model repeated-measures analysis to compare model-adjusted least-squares means over 15 years. The model included the fixed effects of the follow-up years, and the random effect (random intercept) was the \u201cparticipant\u201d. We performed all statistical analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and all testing was two-sided with the significance level set at P < 0.05."
