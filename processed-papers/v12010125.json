        "abstract": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an acute, high-mortality-rate, severe infectious disease caused by an emerging MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that causes severe respiratory diseases. The continuous spread and great pandemic potential of MERS-CoV make it necessarily important to develop effective vaccines. We previously demonstrated that the application of Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles as a bacterial vector displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutralization antibodies. We have also used the rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector to design a recombinant vaccine by expressing the MERS-CoV S1 (spike) protein on the surface of the RV. In this study, we compared the immunological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in BALB/c mice in terms of the levels of humoral and cellular immune responses. The results show that the rabies virus vector-based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the GEM particles vector. However, the GEM particles vector-based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response, even at a very low dose of 1 \u00b5g. These results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humoral and cellular immune responses in the same animal model. This discovery not only provides more alternative vaccine development platforms for MERS-CoV vaccine development, but also provides a theoretical basis for our future selection of vaccine vector platforms for other specific pathogens.",

            "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Soon after its first report, some imported cases occurred in many other countries outside the Arabian Peninsula through infected travelers, most notably the outbreak in South Korea in 2015 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The clinical signs of MERS-CoV-infected patients are similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the outbreaks of which in China in 2003 caused acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Bats and dromedaries are considered as the natural reservoirs of MERS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Up to now, a continuous increase of human cases in the endemic areas has been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], highlighting that it is urgent to develop and make available effective therapeutic drugs and prophylactic vaccines to protect against MERS-CoV.<br/><br/>To date, many promising approaches toward MERS-CoV vaccine candidates have been developed, such as recombinant viral vectors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], protein-based platforms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], bacterial-based platform [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], and DNA vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Most of MERS-CoV vaccine candidates have focused on the major immune-dominant antigen, the S protein of the virion, which plays a significant role in mediating viral entry into target cells and in inducing neutralizing antibodies in experimental animals and infected individuals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 domain of the S protein of the MERS-CoV virus decides the host range and cellular tropism [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. As such, we developed two promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidates using two different platforms. One uses the rabies virus (RV) as a vector to express S1 domains of the MERS-CoV S gene to develop a recombinant MERS-CoV vaccine, and the other applies gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles as a vector to construct a MERS bacterium (Lactococcus lactis)-like particle (BLP) vaccine by displaying the RBD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. A previous study has utilized the RV (BNSP333) vector modified from the RV vaccine vector SPBN to successfully design a vaccine against MERS-CoV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], whereas the RV vector (SRV9 strain) used in our study is screened from the Street Alabama Dufferin (SAD) strain by plaque purification on baby Syrian hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) cells, which have been proven to be safe and have good immunogenicity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. The GEM-PA system is a novel surface display system consisting of nonliving and genetically unmodified GEM particles and a protein anchor (PA) from the Lactococcus lactis peptidoglycan hydrolase AcmA. We utilized the system to successfully display the RBD protein fragment of MERS-CoV, inducing high neutralizing antibodies with intramuscular vaccination and robust antigen-specific local and systemic immune responses by intranasal vaccination [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. The head-to-head comparison of available vaccine vectors is necessary in vaccine design [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. The difference in immune response induced by two different MERS-CoV vaccine candidates and the effect of antigen displayed in viral and bacterial vectors on the immune response are still questionable."

Neutralizing Antibody Response by Pseudovirions Neutralization Assay<br/><br/>To compare the immunological efficacy of two MERS-CoV vaccines derived from two different vectors, we studied the impact on the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV BLP with different doses and the immunogenicity of RV/MERS with only one certain dose in mice. The schematic diagram for group design, immunizations, and immunological characterization is shown in Figure 2a. A total of five groups of mice (G1\u2013G5) were administered three immunizations with a combined adjuvant through an intramuscular (i.m.) route; G1 was immunized with PBS as negative control; G2 was immunized with 8 \u03bcg inactivated and purified RV/MERS; G3\u2013G5 were immunized with 1 \u03bcg (low dose), 5 \u03bcg (medium dose), and 20 \u03bcg (high dose) MERS-CoV BLP, respectively. Sequential sera samples were collected at weeks 0, 2, 5, and 8 and detected for neutralizing activity against pseudotyped MERS-CoV and the binding activity. Splenocytes were harvested at 7 weeks after the last immunization for cytokines analysis. As shown in Figure 2b, G2 developed neutralizing antibody response at 2 weeks after the first immunization, and the neutralizing antibodies of G3, G4, and G5 were not detected at this point. However, the neutralizing antibody of G3, G4, and G5 was significantly higher than G2 at 5 and 8 weeks after immunization. There were also no significant differences in the neutralizing activity among G3, G4, and G5, indicating that 1 \u03bcg MERS-CoV BLP can efficiently induce MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in mice. Overall, these results show that the RV/MERS can rapidly induce neutralizing antibody response, and the MERS BLP can induce higher antibody response in mice."

Each of these candidate vaccines has several advantages and challenges, such as preexisting immunity, immunogenicity, and cost-effectiveness. Here, we have developed two promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidates using two different platforms. One is the recombinant RV expressing MERS-CoV S1 protein fragment, and the other uses GEM particles as a vector to display the MERS-CoV RBD protein fragment. In this study, we compared the humoral and cellular responses in a BALB/c mouse model. The results indicate that the RV/MERS vaccine induces rapidly neutralizing antibody and stronger T-cell immune responses than the MERS-CoV BLP vaccine. However, the MERS-CoV BLP vaccine can induce a higher level of neutralizing antibodies than that of the RV/MERS vaccine."

            "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Soon after its first report, some imported cases occurred in many other countries outside the Arabian Peninsula through infected travelers, most notably the outbreak in South Korea in 2015 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. The clinical signs of MERS-CoV-infected patients are similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the outbreaks of which in China in 2003 caused acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Bats and dromedaries are considered as the natural reservoirs of MERS-CoV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Up to now, a continuous increase of human cases in the endemic areas has been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>], highlighting that it is urgent to develop and make available effective therapeutic drugs and prophylactic vaccines to protect against MERS-CoV.",
            "To date, many promising approaches toward MERS-CoV vaccine candidates have been developed, such as recombinant viral vectors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], protein-based platforms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>], bacterial-based platform [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], and DNA vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. Most of MERS-CoV vaccine candidates have focused on the major immune-dominant antigen, the S protein of the virion, which plays a significant role in mediating viral entry into target cells and in inducing neutralizing antibodies in experimental animals and infected individuals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 domain of the S protein of the MERS-CoV virus decides the host range and cellular tropism [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. As such, we developed two promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidates using two different platforms. One uses the rabies virus (RV) as a vector to express S1 domains of the MERS-CoV S gene to develop a recombinant MERS-CoV vaccine, and the other applies gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles as a vector to construct a MERS bacterium (Lactococcus lactis)-like particle (BLP) vaccine by displaying the RBD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. A previous study has utilized the RV (BNSP333) vector modified from the RV vaccine vector SPBN to successfully design a vaccine against MERS-CoV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>], whereas the RV vector (SRV9 strain) used in our study is screened from the Street Alabama Dufferin (SAD) strain by plaque purification on baby Syrian hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) cells, which have been proven to be safe and have good immunogenicity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. The GEM-PA system is a novel surface display system consisting of nonliving and genetically unmodified GEM particles and a protein anchor (PA) from the Lactococcus lactis peptidoglycan hydrolase AcmA. We utilized the system to successfully display the RBD protein fragment of MERS-CoV, inducing high neutralizing antibodies with intramuscular vaccination and robust antigen-specific local and systemic immune responses by intranasal vaccination [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. The head-to-head comparison of available vaccine vectors is necessary in vaccine design [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. The difference in immune response induced by two different MERS-CoV vaccine candidates and the effect of antigen displayed in viral and bacterial vectors on the immune response are still questionable.",
            "In this study, we evaluated the immunological efficacy of MERS BLP at different doses and the inactivated recombinant MERS antigen in BABL/c mice. Specifically, we compared the ability of these two vaccines to induce MERS-CoV-specific humoral immune response and T-cell-mediated immune response, as well as neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV."

Particularly, G3\u2013G5 acquired a stronger binding to MERS-CoV RBD protein than G2, whereas G1, the control samples, were detected to have negligible binding activity (Figure 3a), indicating the specificity of the IgG antibody response induced by this RBD protein. Additionally, the endpoint titers of the IgG antibody level showed that the immunogenicity of G3\u2013G5 was much stronger than G2 in inducing MERS-CoV RBD-specific IgG antibody response in mice after three vaccinations (Figure 3b). Furthermore, no significant difference was shown for IgG titers among groups G3, G4, and G5, suggesting that 1 \u03bcg antigen protein on the bacterial vector is sufficient to induce high RBD-specific antibody level in mice.

However, the MERS-CoV BLP vaccine can induce a higher level of neutralizing antibodies than that of the RV/MERS vaccine.",
            "Two unique aspects can be highlighted in our study. The first is about the RV vector, besides the MERS-CoV, which has been proven to be successfully utilized for many other emergent infectious diseases, such as the Ebola virus (EBOV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>], Lassa virus (LASV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>], Marburg virus (MARV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>], human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>], and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. Additionally, the Ebola virus vaccine is close to clinical trials [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Notably, chemically inactivated rabies virus vaccines have been widely used for vaccination of humans, dogs, cats, and ferrets, which shows that they are safe for humans and animals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. Therefore, the inactivated rabies virus-based vaccine is also safe and can induce neutralizing antibodies against the target pathogen. Here, the results show that the inactivated rabies virus vectors have very safe and immunogenic profiles in animals and highlight their promise for vaccine development.",
            "The second unique aspect of this study is the GEM-PA system, a novel surface display system, which is a flexible, effective, cost-effective, and easy-to-handle alternative for heterologous proteins to be displayed on the GEM particles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. The GEM particles are from the Lactococcus lactis boiled in acids and mainly contain the bacterial-shaped peptidoglycan spheres, lacking other cell components [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. Additionally, Lactococcus lactis has been safely applied in foods in recent years [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. As such, the GEM-based vaccine is recognized as being safe. Furthermore, the GEM particles have been proven to enhance immune response as a carrier displaying the antigen with high density or adjuvant in vaccine development [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. GEM particles can also improve the humoral and cellular immune response by activating the maturation of the dendritic cells, enhancing the antigen-presenting capacity, and stimulating the DCs to produce cytokines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. Besides that, peptidoglycan, the main component of the GEM particles, is a toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 ligand [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. Moreover, GEM particles can efficiently bind the antigen protein at room temperature to obtain the purified proteins with only a one-step centrifugation process [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. It is convenient and economical to scale up in vaccine development. GEM particles can also bind to different antigen proteins in the same particles to develop multivalent vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. The system has successfully displayed a variety of heterologous proteins from pathogens, showing strong antigen-specific immune responses with parenteral vaccination or mucosal vaccination, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>]. In our study, the results suggest that the RBD protein of MERS-CoV displayed on the GEM particles could induce strong humoral and cellular immune response even when the dose is as low as 1 \u03bcg.",
            "The two vaccine platforms in this study have their own advantages and disadvantages. The RV-based MERS-CoV vaccine platform can rapidly induce antibody immune response and higher cellular immune response than the GEM-based vaccine platform. However, there is a risk of incomplete inactivation in the process of inactivating the RV/MERS. Additionally, RV/MERS vaccine needs to be purified through many purification steps. These factors must be considered in vaccine production. Antigen protein density and distribution on a particle are two key parameters in eliciting an efficient immune response in vaccine design; a high density and ordered antigenic array displayed on a particle makes binding events between the host B-cell surface immunoglobulins and the particle occur more easily, which is an important step in inducing sequential immune response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>]. The GEM-based vaccine platform could display antigen protein in a high density, while the RV-based vaccine platform not only displayed the antigen protein but also expressed the RV GP protein. This may be why the GEM-based vaccine of MERS-CoV induces a much stronger humoral immune response in mice than that of the RV-based vaccine. Micro-particles could promote a humoral immune response, and nano-particles are much easier to induce a cellular immune response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>]. The size of the RV/MERS virion is about 167 nm, and the diameter of the MERS BLP particles is about 2161 nm. This may be a critical factor in inducing a different cellular immune response by two different vectors of vaccine platforms. Specific molecules of microbial origin, as intrinsic innate immune triggers, are endowed with adjuvant activity, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial lipopeptides, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and other conserved molecules [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]. The receptors for these molecules are the mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Members of the TLRs have been confirmed on the cell surface membrane (TLR1/2/4/5/6/10) and on the membrane of endosomes (TLR3/7/8/9) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. Peptidoglycan, the main component of the GEM particles, is a TLR 2 ligand which is an activation of TLR-2 receptors in human peripheralblood mononuclear cells inducing a Th1-type immune response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>]. Single stranded RNA, the component of inactivated rabies virus, is a TLR 7 ligand [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. TLR7/8 agonists have shown Th1 polarizing effects on the immune response. Different receptors play an important role in delivering different signals to the host cells. The activated antigen presenting cells (APCs) precisely define the nature of the perceived danger and send this information to the secondary lymphoid organs, inducing relevant adaptive immune response. This may be another ignored factor of inducing a different immune response by the immune system thinking that the danger is from a virus infection or a bacterial infection. The immune system is triggered by a combination of events and stimuli in vaccine immunology. The compound adjuvants containing the emulsion and PolyI:C (TLR 3 ligand) may be another assignable cause. The speed of the antibodies\u2019 production and cellular immune response needs to be further improved in future study of the GEM-based vaccine platform. To solve the problems, we can try to screen optimum adjuvants for the vaccine or co-displaying protein-adjuvants on GEM particles, such as flagellin (TLR 5 ligand). Furthermore, the GEM-based vaccine platform may be more suitable to develop mucosal vaccines considering that Lactococcus lactis has been safely used as a probiotic in our foods. Understanding the modes of action of the GEM-based vaccine platform will allow us to design a much safer, cost-effective, and protective vaccine with the desired immune response.",
            "The goal of this study was to test vaccine vectors through a head-to-head comparison of immunogenicity of two MERS-CoV vaccine candidates as they might be used in real vaccines for humans or animals. This study provides an important reference for selecting a suitable vaccine platform in developing the MERS-CoV vaccine or other special pathogens in further study.",
