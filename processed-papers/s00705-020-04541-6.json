        "abstract": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel coronavirus that can cause vomiting and watery diarrhea in pigs and death in piglets. Since PDCoV was first detected in 2009 in Hong Kong, the prevalence of PDCoV has increased in recent years, resulting in serious economic losses to the swine industry. The coronavirus spike (S) protein is an antigen that has been demonstrated to contain epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies. The presence of serum and milk IgA antibodies against pathogens that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces is important for mucosal immunity. Here, an indirect anti-PDCoV IgA antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PDCoV S1 IgA ELISA) using the purified S1 portion of S protein as the coating antigen was developed to detect PDCoV IgA antibodies in serum and sow\u2019s milk. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed high specificity and sensitivity of the PDCoV-S1-IgA-ELISA based on samples confirmed by IFA. Anti-PDCoV IgA antibodies in 152 serum samples and 65 milk samples collected from six farms that had experienced diarrhea outbreaks within previous last two years were detected by this assay, and 62.5% of the serum samples and 100% of the milk samples were positive for PDCoV. The indirect ELISA method established in this study will provide a convenient tool for measurement of serum and milk IgA levels against PDCoV in pig herds, rapid detection of PDCoV infection in pigs, and evaluation of the immunogenicity of vaccines.",

However, PDCoV is an enteric pathogen, and the presence of IgA antibodies against pathogens that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces is important for mucosal immunity. IgA is an important immunoglobulin for mucosal immunity that can be detected in serum and milk of pigs after virus challenge or inoculation, and therefore serum and milk IgA antibodies to enteric pathogens can act as indicators [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Therefore, measuring IgA levels in serum and milk samples is critical for evaluating the level of protection of the mucosal response against PDCoV infection. Here, we have developed an indirect anti-PDCoV IgA antibody ELISA that uses the purified S1 portion of PDCoV S protein as a coating antigen. This assay will serve as a convenient tool for measuring of serum and milk IgA antibody levels in pig herds. Many studies have shown that serum antibodies are passed mainly to piglets through sow\u2019s milk, which results in passive immunoprotection. IgA antibodies have a variety of biological functions, such as inhibiting adhesion and immunological exclusion and neutralization of viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Thus, an indirect ELISA for detection of IgA antibodies against PDCoV can be used as a sensitive and specific quantitative method to evaluate immunity to PDCoV."

        "Discussion": [
            "PDCoV can cause vomiting and watery diarrhea in pigs, resulting in serious economic losses to the swine industry. Here, we have developed an indirect anti-PDCoV IgA ELISA that used the purified PDCoV S1 protein as a coating antigen for the measurement of serum and milk IgA levels in pigs, and used this assay to determine the prevalence of PDCoV on a few pig farms in China that had experienced diarrhea outbreaks within the previous two years.",
            "In PDCoV-infected pigs, serum IgG and IgA antibodies could be detected at 14 days post-inoculation, after which PDCoV-specific IgG and IgA antibody titers increased and remained high until the pigs had fully recovered from clinical disease [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. In our study, IgA-positive milk samples tested negative for IgG, indicating that the concentration of IgG antibodies in milk was relatively low or that the method was not sensitive enough to detect IgG antibodies. Based on what is known about IgA and IgG dynamics during PDCoV infection, we chose to detect IgA rather than IgG, which allows PDCoV infection to be monitored by detecting IgA antibodies in milk samples. PDCoV is an enteric pathogen that replicates primarily on mucosal surfaces. As with other coronaviruses, the presence of serum antibodies against generated from the ROC curve was similar to the PR cutoff value of 34.51 determined using negative sera.",
            "A total of 152 serum and 62 milk samples were collected from six provinces and tested using the PDCoV S1 IgA ELISA. The results showed that 62.5% (95/152) of the serum samples and 100% (65/65) of the milk samples were positive for anti-PDCoV IgA antibodies (Table 1).",
            "PDCoV is not always correlated with protection. On the contrary, detection of antibodies only shows that individuals have had previous contact with pathogens or have been vaccinated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>].",
            "In the present study, an indirect PDCoV IgA ELISA was developed to monitor IgA levels in serum and milk. This assay will aid in the future assessment of protection against PDCoV infection. Mucosal immunity plays an important role in immune protection, not only because it has a general pathogen-clearing effect but also because it involves both humoral and cellular immunity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. IgA is an important immunoglobulin for mucosal immunity that is secreted by the intestinal mucosa, and it provides resistance against invasive pathogens. High-affinity IgA can directly neutralize toxins and pathogens, while low-affinity IgA can prevent pathogen adhesion. IgA is also an important serum immunoglobulin that mediates a variety of protective functions through interactions with specific receptors and immune mediators [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>].",
            "PDCoV has an obvious intestinal tropism, and it is necessary to investigate the dynamics of PDCoV antibody production and antibody duration to better understand the mechanism of immunity to virus-induced diarrhea. Therefore, the indirect ELISA method established in this study provides a convenient tool for measuring serum and milk IgA levels in pigs as well as a basis for studying clinical IgA antibody responses to PDCoV infection and assessing the efficacy of future vaccines."
