        "abstract": "Background: As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus.\nMethods: In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-HostsReservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2.\nResults: The value of R0 was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58.\nConclusions: Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.",

            "In this study, we developed RP transmission model, which considering the routes from reservoir to person and from person to person of SARS-CoV-2 respectively. We used the models to fit the reported data in Wuhan City, China from published literature [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The simulation results showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.58 from person to person. There was a research showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI: 2.47\u20132.86) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Another research showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV2 was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4\u20133.9) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The different values might be due to the different methods. The methods which Li et al employed were based on the epidemic growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Our previous study showed that several methods could be used to calculate the R0 based on the epidemic growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval, and different methods might result in different values of R0 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Our results also showed that the R0 of SARSCoV-2 was 2.30 from reservoir to person which was lower than that of person to person. This means that the transmission route was mainly from person to person rather than from reservoir to person in the early stage of the transmission in Wuhan City. However, this result was based on the limited data from a published literature, and it might not show the real situation at the early stage of the transmission."

The hosts were hunted and sent to the seafood market which was defined as the reservoir of the virus. People exposed to the market got the risks of the infection (Fig. 1). The BHRP transmission network model was based on the following assumptions or facts: a) The bats were divided into four compartments: susceptible bats (SB), exposed bats (EB), infected bats (IB), and removed bats (RB). The birth rate and death rate of bats were defined as nB and mB. In this model, we set \u0245B = nB \u00d7 NB as the number of the newborn bats where NB refer to the total number of bats. The incubation period of bat infection was defined as 1/\u03c9B and the infectious period of bat infection was defined as 1/\u03b3B.

We also assumed that symptomatic infected people and asymptomatic infected people could export the virus into W with the rate of \u03bcP and \u03bc\u2019P, although this assumption might occur in a low probability.

        "Discussion": [
            "In this study, we developed RP transmission model, which considering the routes from reservoir to person and from person to person of SARS-CoV-2 respectively. We used the models to fit the reported data in Wuhan City, China from published literature [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The simulation results showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.58 from person to person. There was a research showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68 (95% CI: 2.47\u20132.86) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Another research showed that the R0 of SARS-CoV2 was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4\u20133.9) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The different values might be due to the different methods. The methods which Li et al employed were based on the epidemic growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Our previous study showed that several methods could be used to calculate the R0 based on the epidemic growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval, and different methods might result in different values of R0 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Our results also showed that the R0 of SARSCoV-2 was 2.30 from reservoir to person which was lower than that of person to person. This means that the transmission route was mainly from person to person rather than from reservoir to person in the early stage of the transmission in Wuhan City. However, this result was based on the limited data from a published literature, and it might not show the real situation at the early stage of the transmission.",
            "Researches showed that the R0 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was about 2.7\u20133.4 or 2\u20134 in Hong Kong, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Another research found that the R0 of SARS was about 2.1 in Hong Kong, China, 2.7 in Singapore, and 3.8 in Beijing, China [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Therefore, we believe that the commonly acceptable average value of the R0 of SARS might be 2.9 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. The transmissibility of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is much lower than SARS. The reported value of the R0 of",
            "MERS was about 0.8\u20131.3 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], with the inter-human transmissibility of the disease was about 0.6 or 0.9 in Middle East countries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. However, MERS had a high transmissibility in the outbreak in the Republic of Korea with the R0 of 2.5\u20137.2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. Therefore, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 might be higher than MERS in the Middle East countries, similar to SARS, but lower than MERS transmitted in the Republic of Korea.",
            "To contain the transmission of the virus, it is important to decrease R0. According to the equation of R0 deduced from the simplified RP model, R0 is related to many parameters. The mainly parameters which could be changed were bP, bW, and \u03b3. Interventions such as wearing masks and increasing social distance could decrease the bP, the intervention that close the seafood market could decrease the bW, and shorten the duration form symptoms onset to be diagnosed could decrease 1/\u03b3. All these interventions could decrease the effective reproduction number and finally be helpful to control the transmission.",
            "Since there are too many parameters in our model, several limitations exist in this study. Firstly, we did not use the detailed data of the SARS-CoV-2 to perform the estimation instead of using the data from literatures [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. We simulated the natural history of the infection that the proportion of asymptomatic infection was 50%, and the transmissibility of asymptomatic infection was half of that of symptomatic infection, which were different to those of MERS and SARS. It is known that the proportion of asymptomatic infection of MERS and SARS was lower than 10%. Secondly, the parameters of population mobility were not from an accurate dataset. Thirdly, since there was no data of the initial prevalence of the virus in the seafood market, we assumed the initial value of 1/100 000. This assumption might lead to the simulation been under- or over-estimated. In addition, since we did not consider the changing rate of the individual\u2019s activity (such as wearing masks, increasing social distance, and not to travel to Wuhan City), the estimation of importation of the virus might not be correct. All these limitations will lead to the uncertainty of our results. Therefore, the accuracy and the validity of the estimation would be better if the models fit the first-hand data on the population mobility and the data on the natural history, the epidemiological characteristics, and the transmission mechanism of the virus."
