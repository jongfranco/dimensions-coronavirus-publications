            "More shocking headlines appeared after Hong Kong\u2019s leading public health epidemiologist, Prof. Gabriel Leung, was widely quoted as saying that the coronavirus epidemic (not yet called a pandemic, note) could spread to about two-thirds of the world\u2019s population if it could not be controlled. \u201860% of the world\u2019s population is an awfully big number,\u2019 Leung said. This figure was based on the reproductive number of 2.5, meaning that each infected person would transmit to about 2.5 other people. This reproductive number is so far based on that seen in the quarantined cities in China, where people have been forbidden to leave and even though individuals are supposedly in isolation, proximity is likely to result in transmission among family members and other close contacts.",
            "this has been seen by the media and the public as a sign that this particular viral outbreak is particularly frightening. Importantly, the WHO has not recommended travel or trade bans \u2013 it seldom does when declaring a PHEIC. But of course this is how many countries have responded, ignoring public health science and responding to media hysteria and essentially closing their borders to anyone from mainland China. Travel bans to control the spread of disease have been tried since 1377 when Dubrovnik imposed a 40-day isolation period on ships suspected of carrying the black plague that tried to enter the city waters.",
