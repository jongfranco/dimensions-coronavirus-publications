Therefore, in patients with COVID-19, the incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression.",
            "The mechanism of acute myocardial injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection might be related to ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed not only in the lungs but also in the cardiovascular system and, therefore, ACE2-related signalling pathways might also have a role in heart injury. Other proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury include a cytokine storm triggered by an imbalanced response by type 1 and type 2 T helper cells[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], and respiratory dysfunction and hypoxaemia caused by COVID-19, resulting in damage to myocardial cells."

        "Chronic cardiovascular damage": [
            "A 12-year follow-up survey of 25 patients who recovered from SARS-CoV infection found that 68% had hyperlipidaemia, 44% had cardiovascular system abnormalities and 60% had glucose metabolism disorders[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Metabolomics analysis revealed that lipid metabolism was dysregulated in patients with a history of SARS-CoV infection. In these patients, the serum concentrations of free fatty acids, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were significantly increased compared with individuals without a history of SARS-CoV infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV infection leads to disorders of lipid and glucose metabolism are still uncertain. Given that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar structure to SARS-CoV, this novel virus might also cause chronic damage to the cardiovascular system, and attention should be given to cardiovascular protection during treatment for COVID-19.",
            "A meta-analysis showed that MERS-CoV infection was more likely to occur in patients with underlying CVD8. In patients with MERS-CoV infection and severe symptoms, 50% had hypertension and diabetes and up to 30% had heart disease. Similarly, according to the Pneumonitis Diagnosis and Treatment Program for New Coronavirus Infection (Trial Version 4), elderly people with comorbidities are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, especially those with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes. Furthermore, patients with CVD are more likely to develop severe symptoms if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, patients with CVD account for a large proportion of deaths from COVID-19. In one study, among the patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, 58% had hypertension, 25% had heart disease and 44% had arrhythmia[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. According to mortality data released by the NHC, 35% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a history of hypertension and 17% had a history of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, data show that patients aged >60 years who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 had more systemic symptoms and more severe pneumonia than patients aged \u226460 years[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. Therefore, in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, underlying CVD can aggravate the pneumonia and increase the severity of symptoms.",
            "Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 often have a poor prognosis. In patients with ACS, cardiac functional reserve can be reduced owing to myocardial ischaemia or necrosis. When infected with SARS-CoV-2, cardiac insufficiency is more likely to occur, leading to a sudden deterioration in the condition of these patients. Some of the patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan had previous ACS, which was associated with severe illness and high mortality. For patients with cardiac insufficiency who have underlying heart disease, SARS-CoV-2 infection might act as a precipitating factor to worsen the condition and lead to death.",
            "Drug-related heart damage during COVID-19 treatment is a concern. In particular, the use of antiviral drugs should be monitored. In a study of 138 patients with COVID-19, 89.9% were given antiviral drugs[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. However, many antiviral drugs can cause cardiac insufficiency, arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disorders. Therefore, during treatment of COVID-19, especially with the use of antivirals, the risk of cardiac toxicity must be closely monitored[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]."
