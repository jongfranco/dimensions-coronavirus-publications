            "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause china epidemics with high morbidity and mortality,the infection has been transmitted to other countries. About 3 neonates and more than 230 children cases are reported. The disease condition of mainly children was mild.There is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to the newborn. The treatment strategy for children with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is based on adult experience. Thus far, no deaths have been reported in the paediatric age group. This review describes the current understanding of COVID-19 infection in newborns and children.",
            "Since December 2019, patients with fever, dry cough, normal or decreased white blood cell counts who were initially diagnosed as \" Fever of Unknown Origin with pneumonia \" have been continuously increasing in Wuhan[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. The causative agent of this unexplained infected pneumonia was identified as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which not only has a strong human-to-human transmission,but also causes severe pneumonia to death[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. SARS-CoV-2 is so aggressive that the infection has been transmitted to other countries and is seriously imperilling human life. WHO has declared this disease to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. A total of"

            "Neonatologist must wear protective equipment (including hats,goggles, protective suits, gloves, N95 masks, etc.) to resuscitate neonates delivered by confirmed and/or suspected COVID-19 puerperant. If the puerperant is positive for SARS-CoV-2, the neonate must be isolated, then detected SARS-CoV-2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>].",
            "Early identification and early isolation are imperative for COVID-19 control. COVID-19 neonates should be placed in negative pressure rooms or in rooms in which room exhaust is filtered through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters with reference to MERS management[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. No visiting are allowed for neonates of COVID-19. Treatment mainly depends on adult patients clinical experience due to few cases in children. There is no specific drug treatment for SARS-CoV-2 just like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV[19.26], Symptomatic and supportive treatment are the mainstay of therapy for patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection including the supply of oxygen, the maintenance of water electrolyte and acid-base balance.The supplement of water and electrolyte should be appropriate, so as to avoid aggravating the pulmonary edema and reduced oxygenation[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. For newborns with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, high-dose pulmonary surfactant (PS), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and extracorporeal membrane lung (ECMO) may be useful.In the United States, A patients' conditions were improved apparently after treatment with nucleoside analogue-remdesivir, but there was just one case,the efficacy needs further verification[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. Interferon-\u03b12b nebulization were be applied in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV,so it could be considered to use in SARS-CoV-2 infection[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>,30]. In addition,three potential drug combinations (sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) are candidate repurposable drugs[31]. Moreover, convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-2-recovered patients may be useful for SARS-CoV-2 infection, because of a significant reduction in the mortality following convalescent sera from SARS-recovered patients treatment [32]."

            "COVID-19 can result in asymptomatic to severe illness, Fortunately children without underlying diseases appeared to have mild disease. The disease condition of the neonates were also slightly. Though this new virus come out without specific antiviral drugs treatment, neonatologist need to more virological,epidemiological and clinical data to treat and manage COVID-19.",
