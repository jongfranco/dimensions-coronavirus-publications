        "abstract": "Background: Bats provide important ecosystem services; however, current evidence supports that they host several zoonotic viruses, including species of the Coronaviridae family. If bats in close interaction with humans host and shed coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, spillover may occur. Therefore, strategies aiming to mitigate potential spillover and disease emergence, while supporting the conservation of bats and their important ecological roles are needed. Past research suggests that coronavirus shedding in bats varies seasonally following their reproductive cycle; however, shedding dynamics have been assessed in only a few species, which does not allow for generalization of findings across bat taxa and geographic regions.\nMethods: To assess the generalizability of coronavirus shedding seasonality, we sampled hundreds of bats belonging to several species with different life history traits across East Africa at different times of the year. We assessed, via Bayesian modeling, the hypothesis that chiropterans, across species and spatial domains, experience seasonal trends in coronavirus shedding as a function of the reproductive cycle.\nResults: We found that, beyond spatial, taxonomic, and life history differences, coronavirus shedding is more expected when pups are becoming independent from the dam and that juvenile bats are prone to shed these viruses.\nConclusions: These findings could guide policy aimed at the prevention of spillover in limited-resource settings, where longitudinal surveillance is not feasible, by identifying high-risk periods for coronavirus shedding. In these periods, contact with bats should be avoided (for example, by impeding or forbidding people access to caves). Our proposed strategy provides an alternative to culling \u2013 an ethically questionable practice that may result in higher pathogen levels \u2013 and supports the conservation of bats and the delivery of their key ecosystem services.",

The lighter colors represent the range where the 90% of the estimated detection values are concentrated (the High Posterior Density Interval). The darker colors show the 51% High Posterior Density Interval coronavirus seroprevalence study in bats. Such studies are important to understand the drivers of pathogen persistence and spillover risk, and in consequence, to ethically manage and prevent bat pathogen exposure. Nevertheless, this kind of research is difficult to conduct due to logistical challenges, our questionable ability to obtain statisticallyrepresentative samples across age groups, cross-reactivity of serological assays, and the difficulties to differentiate serodynamics derived from closed-population processes from those caused by migratory movements. Although extrapolations for antibody dynamics across viruses and species are not simple [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>], bat serodynamics for Hendra virus are congruent with the increased detection of coronaviruses after the birth pulse. Pups passively receive maternal Hendra virus antibodies which decline after the first month of age up to 6 months of age [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>]. This decline would lead to a period in which young bats tend to be more susceptible to infection, become infected, and then shed virus. Consistently, coronavirus shedding peaked weeks after the birth pulse in a German and a Chinese species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>] and immunologically na\u00efve bats shed higher coronavirus loads [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. Over time, as young bats clear Hendra virus infection, they become seropositive again [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>]. Concordantly, capture-mark-recapture studies support the clearance of coronaviruses in infected bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>], which would become seropositive. However, young bats may not reach adult seroprevalence levels until they are older than a year, as occurs with Hendra virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c91\" href=\"#r91\">91</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c92\" href=\"#r92\">92</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c94\" href=\"#r94\">94</a>]. Therefore, the population of juvenile bats would remain comparatively more susceptible to viral infection and shedding beyond the period immediately after weaning. Age-specific henipavirus seroprevalence in African E. helvum is in agreement with the serodynamics described for Hendra virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c90\" href=\"#r90\">90</a>]"

If the bats in these interfaces shed CoVs with the ability to infect humans, then opportunities for spillover through direct exposure to feces [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>] or the contamination of food are created, as these viruses can remain infectious in the environment for days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>].

If exposure through contact with bat feces is a main pathway for zoonotic CoV spillover to humans but shedding of these pathogens is not uniform over time, then mitigation strategies aiming to prevent bat CoV-shed exposure could be targeted temporally, directed especially at highrisk seasons. Such a strategy could guide policy in limitedresource settings where sampling bats for CoV testing is not feasible and it could support an ethically acceptable management to mitigate spillover risk. However, the few species and locations tested to date do not allow for identification of a potential seasonal shedding pattern to responsibly suggest temporal spillover risk management across species and geography. Therefore, assessment of the CoV dynamics in a broader range of bat species that show different life history traits, as well as in diverse geographic and ecological circumstances, could be extremely useful.",

This geographical region has been identified as a hotspot of pathogen emergence [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>], where CoV host switching events seem to be higher compared to other areas [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>], but, to our knowledge, no study on CoV dynamics in bats has been conducted. Specifically, we hypothesized that bat species exhibit seasonal trends in CoV shedding that are associated with the reproductive season. We assessed this hypothesis by fitting Bayesian statistical multivariable models to evaluate whether CoV shedding in bats is positively associated with the time period when pups are becoming independent from the dam. Beyond the inclusion of several species sampled in different countries at different times, we explicitly identified the reproductive events for each species at the time of sampling and also included other traits, such as the aggregation of individuals at the roost, that may be involved in CoV dynamics."

Obtained sequences were compared against sequences in the GenBank and Barcode of Life databases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c60\" href=\"#r60\">60</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c61\" href=\"#r61\">61</a>]. When possible or necessary, sequences from both genes were used for species identification. A threshold of 97% nucleotide identity was used to confirm the species; sequences with 95\u201397% nucleotide identity were assigned a \u201cconferre\u201d (cf.) species status, and sequences below 95% nucleotide identity were either classified to the genus level or as unidentified. Sequences with > 97% nucleotide identity to more than one species for either gene, were classified to the genus level unless they clearly clustered with sequences from other animals in the same geographic area.",
            "If barcoding results for all of the first ten bats tested per species were in agreement with the field identification, we assumed that the field identification for the remaining bats of that species in each country was correct. Otherwise, all of the remaining samples were barcoded to ensure correct speciation.",
            "Bat life history We recorded when sampled females were pregnant based on abdominal palpation, had attached pups (indicating recent parturition), and were lactating, as well as when juveniles were captured. Therefore, we were able to track pregnancy, lactation, and recent birth pulses. Moreover, we accessed the data in the PanTHERIA [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c62\" href=\"#r62\">62</a>] and Amniote [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c63\" href=\"#r63\">63</a>] databases, and we thoroughly reviewed the literature on the biology of the bats species we sampled for latitudes similar to our sampling locations. With the gathering of these information sources we established the timing of the birth pulses, lactation periods, and the weaning of pups for each species. For the details justifying the dates inferred for these three life history events for each species and the corresponding bibliographical references see Additional file 1.",
            "Once the timing of these events was confirmed or inferred, we were able to establish 2 seasons that occur at least once during the year across all observed bat species: i) when juveniles are being weaned and female-pup contact decreases (\u201cRecent weaning\u201d [RW]) and ii) the rest of the year (hereafter \u201cN-RW\u201d for \u201cNot recent weaning\u201d). We chose to evaluate risk of CoV shedding for the first period because past longitudinal studies with microchiropterans in Germany and China found higher CoV-RNA loads approximately 1 month after parturition [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>]. Similarly, peaks were found 2 months after the formation of a maternity colony of Myotis macropus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>], which would match a post weaning period for that species. Here, we defined the end of the RW period as 1 month after the last pups were weaned. We assumed that 1 month would provide a reasonable time window for the colony to \u201cclear\u201d the CoV susceptibility status of this period and acquire the susceptibility corresponding to the season(s) when weaning does not occur (N-RW period), if differences actually exist.",
            "Finally, once we determined these two seasons, we categorized each bat sample into one of them depending on the week of the year in which they were taken. Because some species had more than one litter per year, there could be more than one RW period during the year. It is worth noting that we were able to define these periods for those species in our dataset that have synchronized reproduction, whose biology was properly described, and whose taxonomy is generally accepted. When we could not assign a reproductive period to specific bats, this season was imputed (see Methods: Statistical Analysis).",

Further, we did not assess postpartum estrus, as within the study area, it is only known to occur in some Molossid bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>], of which we only sampled a small number.",

The description of the imputation model is provided in Additional file 3.",

Finally, C1...l categorical variables could be retained as well if they were marginally associated with CoV detection (the corresponding coefficient PPD did not include zero).

These reproductive seasons were imputed as explained above. This imputation process did not substantively affect the proportion of bats in each reproductive period or the crude CoV detection per age (Additional file 3: Figure S3.2). Moreover, we had partial data for Neoromicia nana and Triaenops persicus lactation period and we assigned one that is likely longer than it would be in reality based on the other species. Even under this overextended period, none of these bats (N. nana and T. persicus) could have being sampled during the RW season, so this knowledge gap did not risk a misclassification (Fig. 2).",

        "Conclusions": [
            "Data from hundreds of bats collected in East-Africa show that coronavirus shedding is expected to be more frequent when pups are becoming independent from the dam, independently of the age of the bats, their species, their location, and their life histories; however, the odds of shedding do differ by species. These results can guide temporal-based mitigation strategies to prevent bat-associated coronavirus exposure using non-lethal methods in limited-resource settings, where longitudinal surveillance is not feasible, by identifying high-risk periods for coronavirus shedding when contact with bats should be avoided."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "If coronavirus shedding by bats follows temporal patterns that are generalizable across species and locations, then mitigation strategies targeting the prevention of human exposure and potential spillover could be directed toward high-risk periods, through mechanisms that can also support bat-human coexistence and the provision of bat ecosystem services. Previous research has focused on viral identification in specific locations and in few species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>], resulting in a limited representation of viral dynamics in association with few ecological settings, biological traits, and reproductive strategies. Additionally, few studies of coronavirus shedding patterns have employed statistical models and, in consequence, the potential complex web of factors and causal relationships that may determine this process has not been fully explored. Here, we aimed to address these issues by",
            "SD Standard deviation and 80%, HPDI = 90% high posterior density interval statistically modeling coronavirus RNA detection in several bat species, captured at different times and locations in East Africa and involving different ecological contexts and life histories. Using data from several hundreds of bats, we found that, beyond spatial, taxonomic, and life history differences; i) the odds of coronavirus shedding is higher during the period when pups are being weaned (up to a month after the lactation period is over), and ii) juvenile bats have higher odds to shed these viruses. Moreover, the ratios of predicted detections per bat category (age and reproductive season) suggest that juvenile bats during the recent weaning period have relatively higher shedding compared to bats out of this period no matter their age. Caution must be taken with these ratios because we used a logit link and our data had high proportion of CoV shedding in specific groups. However, our results are consistent, and they are in agreement with previous research conducted in a restricted number of species and locations.",
            "Similar seasonality of coronavirus shedding has been observed in Germany, Australia, Thailand, China, and Ghana (West Africa). In the specific species involved in these previous studies, higher coronavirus shedding and viral loads were detected weeks after the birth pulse [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>]. Further, and consistent with our results, detection of higher levels of coronavirus in juveniles has been reported in micro- as well megabats from Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c86\" href=\"#r86\">86</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c89\" href=\"#r89\">89</a>].",
            "It has been proposed that the increased detection of coronaviruses after the birth pulse is attributable to the waning of passively-received maternal antibodies in juveniles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>]. This idea has been frequently cited; however, we are not aware of any longitudinal age-specific",
            "Additionally, coronavirus transmission may be favored by high colony density created by the birth pulse, as previously proposed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c95\" href=\"#r95\">95</a>], and then the seasonal influx of susceptible juveniles could accelerate viral spread across the entire colony, including adult bats. Indeed, adult Myotis macropus in an Australian colony showed a peak of coronavirus detection after the birth pulse [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>]. The peak of coronavirus detection for two Hipposideros species and Nycteris cf. gambiensis sampled in Ghana occurred during the months that encompassed the birth pulse and nursing after accounting for the age of the sampled individuals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]. Higher coronavirus infection has also been reported in lactating females [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c88\" href=\"#r88\">88</a>], which overlap with the period of pup weaning and decay of maternally-derived immunity; however, the opposite has also been found [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c48\" href=\"#r48\">48</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c85\" href=\"#r85\">85</a>].",
            "In practical terms, public health managers could anticipate high risk periods for coronavirus shedding to target interventions. Assuming that higher spillover risk is a function of higher viral shedding [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>] and that all coronaviruses with zoonotic potential behave ecologically similarly to coronaviruses detected in this study, managers could target the prevention of human-bat direct (consumption) or indirect (bat droppings) contact specifically during the high-risk season: around and just after weaning, the timing of observable juveniles or individuals smaller than adults. For the species and interfaces defined herein, those management periods have now been determined (Fig. 2). For others, direct observation of bats at high-risk transmission interfaces could be used to identify time periods when non-adult sized bats are present. However, observation of dependent pups is not always easy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c96\" href=\"#r96\">96</a>]. Of course, for specific species, birth pulses and lactation seasons could also be used to more precisely establish high risk periods similar to the methods we used here, including a combination of direct observation, reports from previous literature, and consultation with knowledgeable bat biologists. Our proposed risk-driven strategy i) is evidence-based, as it builds upon coronavirus shedding patterns observed across several chiropteran species present around the world; ii) does not require the advanced laboratory capacity often lacking in resource-restricted settings where intense bat-human interfaces usually occur; iii) is a good alternative to the ideal but expensive and resourceintensive longitudinal surveys; and iv) it may prevent the exposure to viruses belonging to other taxa whose observed bat shedding dynamics resemble our findings for coronaviruses (e.g. paramyxoviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c97\" href=\"#r97\">97</a>]), The lower coronavirus detections in African emballonurids (C. afra and T. mauritianus) and the higher detections in E. helvum, African hipposiderids (Hipposideros sp. and T. persicus), and R. cf. clivosus that we found are consistent with previous reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c98\" href=\"#r98\">98</a>] and should be considered by managers when providing risk-based spillover prevention strategies. Moreover, SARS-like coronaviruses in Africa have been found in hipposiderid, rhinolophid, and molossid bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c98\" href=\"#r98\">98</a>], and MERS-related coronaviruses have been found in vespertillionid bats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to prioritize the identification of birth pulses and lactation seasons, and thus determine high-risk periods of coronavirus shedding, for these bat families. Interestingly, E. helvum roost in tight clusters that can contain hundreds of individuals [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c99\" href=\"#r99\">99</a>], similar to T. persicus. On the other hand, emballonurids, showing the lowest crude detection levels across families (represented by Coleura afra and Taphozous mauritanus here) tend not to cluster while roosting [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c100\" href=\"#r100\">100</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c101\" href=\"#r101\">101</a>]. We did find an association between coronavirus shedding and whether the species typically aggregate in clusters while roosting when the variable \u201cE. helvum \u2013 T. persicus\u201d was not considered, but we chose a different model not including this term because we did not directly assess bat roosts and our categorization may oversimplify the continuum from mostly solitary roosting (e.g., Neromocia nana) to common tight aggregations of bats (e.g., Mops condylurus). Using this categorization could be misleading, as some species differentially cluster while roosting depending on temperature, colony size, colony type (e.g., maternity colony versus not a maternity colony), and season [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c72\" href=\"#r72\">72</a>]. Future studies should consider the roosting habits of bats, as this trait could further support riskbased management to prevent or reduce human exposure.",
            "The risk-driven strategy we propose provides a contactreduction alternative that is ethically favorable compared to often-employed measures, such as culling or other reactive measures, that ensue when the public becomes aware of a health threat without a suggested practical option to reduce their risk for exposure. In addition to ethical concerns and being logistically difficult and expensive, culling has failed to reduce disease in wild populations and can result in even higher pathogen levels. For example, \u201cbadger culling can make no meaningful contribution to cattle tuberculosis control in Britain\u201d [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c102\" href=\"#r102\">102</a>]. A culling program to reduce Echinococcus multilocularis prevalence in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) resulted in an increase of infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c103\" href=\"#r103\">103</a>]. This strategy has also failed to control rabies in canids around the globe [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c104\" href=\"#r104\">104</a>]. Similar results have been observed in bats. Culling failed to reduce rabies seroprevalence in Desmodus rotundus in Per\u00fa and could have increased the levels of exposure to the virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c105\" href=\"#r105\">105</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c106\" href=\"#r106\">106</a>]. In Argentina, the extermination of bats changed the direction of spread of rabies in livestock but did not prevent its advancement [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c107\" href=\"#r107\">107</a>]. In Uganda, miners exterminated a colony of Rousettus aegyptiacus bats after an outbreak of Marburg virus in 2007 that involved 4 miners in close contact with these bats. Five years later, a new outbreak occurred in miners from the same mine. The second time, Marburg virus RNA was detected in a higher proportion in the R. aegyptiacus that recolonized the mine (13.3%, n = 400; [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c108\" href=\"#r108\">108</a>]) compared to RNA detection before culling in this cave (5.1%, n = 611; [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c109\" href=\"#r109\">109</a>]) and other caves in Uganda (2.5%, n = 1622; [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c67\" href=\"#r67\">67</a>]) and Gabon (4.8%, n = 187; [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c110\" href=\"#r110\">110</a>]) where culling has never been reported.",
            "Culling can also cause demographic changes, leading to a higher proportion of juvenile individuals. This change may occur because of a disproportionate cull of older individuals; the potential increase in survival of pups at lower population densities, followed by higher recruitment of juvenile females into reproductive age [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c111\" href=\"#r111\">111</a>]; the hypothetical increase of young dispersers immigrating from neighboring colonies into culled, less dense, and better resourced colonies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c105\" href=\"#r105\">105</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c112\" href=\"#r112\">112</a>]; or by causing compensatory reproduction [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c113\" href=\"#r113\">113</a>]. This last possibility may have not been studied in bats but seems unlikely due to their high conception rates and usual litter size of one. Examples of younger populations after culling have been reported in the red deer (Cervus elaphus), racoon (Procyon lotor), American mink (Mustela vison), and Australian brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), among others [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c114\" href=\"#r114\">114</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c117\" href=\"#r117\">117</a>]. As our results and past research consistently show higher viral shedding and detection in young individuals, activities leading to a younger bat population are not advisable for viral spillover management. Similar results are expected when fruit bats are culled based on being categorized as \u201cagricultural pests\u201d; therefore, this kind of management may create higher risk of viral exposure to the human population.",
            "Virological, ecological, and epidemiological research on bats over the last 15 years has helped to identify chiropterans as hosts of zoonotic viruses and to document that human-driven environmental change, human behavior, and human-to-human transmission are the key drivers for the creation of bat-human interfaces, spillover, and epidemics of emergent viruses, respectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c118\" href=\"#r118\">118</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c120\" href=\"#r120\">120</a>]. In the context of the current biodiversity and bat conservation crisis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c121\" href=\"#r121\">121</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c122\" href=\"#r122\">122</a>], we must not omit these facts when attempting to effectively, and responsibly frame and communicate disease risks associated with bats. Realistic, data-based risk communication is of paramount importance to avoid framing bats as a threat to humans and to support bat conservation given their important ecological roles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c123\" href=\"#r123\">123</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c124\" href=\"#r124\">124</a>]. With this background, it seems a proper time for the scientific community studying \u201cbat-associated\u201d viruses to move the conversation from bat spillover risk assessments to the planning of pro-biodiversity and subsequently pro-ecosystem strategies aiming to mitigate spillover risk. Science is valued not only for the diagnosis of problems but because it finds solutions to them. Here, we have attempted to aid the progress of scientific and management dialogue by proposing, not only a management strategy to limit potential coronavirus spillover, but one that is context- and logistically-grounded and pro-conservation, promoting the delivery of the key ecosystem services provided by bats.",
