        "abstract": "Internal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is one of the most common and abundant modifications of RNA. However, the biological roles of viral RNA m6A remain elusive. Here, using human metapneumovirus (HMPV) as a model, we demonstrate that m6A serves as a molecular marker for innate immune discrimination of self from non-self RNAs. We show that HMPV RNAs are m6A methylated and that viral m6A methylation promotes HMPV replication and gene expression. Inactivating m6A addition sites with synonymous mutations or demethylase resulted in m6A-deficient recombinant HMPVs and virion RNAs that induced increased expression of type I interferon, which was dependent on the cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I, and not on melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Mechanistically, m6A-deficient virion RNA induces higher expression of RIG-I, binds more efficiently to RIG-I and facilitates the conformational change of RIG-I, leading to enhanced interferon expression. Furthermore, m6A-deficient recombinant HMPVs triggered increased interferon in vivo and were attenuated in cotton rats but retained high immunogenicity. Collectively, our results highlight that (1) viruses acquire m6A in their RNA as a means of mimicking cellular RNA to avoid detection by innate immunity and (2) viral RNA m6A can serve as a target to attenuate HMPV for vaccine purposes.",

            "Internal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is one of the most common and abundant modifications of RNA. However, the biological roles of viral RNA m6A remain elusive. Here, using human metapneumovirus (HMPV) as a model, we demonstrate that m6A serves as a molecular marker for innate immune discrimination of self from non-self RNAs. We show that HMPV RNAs are m6A methylated and that viral m6A methylation promotes HMPV replication and gene expression. Inactivating m6A addition sites with synonymous mutations or demethylase resulted in m6A-deficient recombinant HMPVs and virion RNAs that induced increased expression of type I interferon, which was dependent on the cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I, and not on melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Mechanistically, m6A-deficient virion RNA induces higher expression of RIG-I, binds more efficiently to RIG-I and facilitates the conformational change of RIG-I, leading to enhanced interferon expression. Furthermore, m6A-deficient recombinant HMPVs triggered increased interferon in vivo and were attenuated in cotton rats but retained high immunogenicity. Collectively, our results highlight that (1) viruses acquire m6A in their RNA as a means of mimicking cellular RNA to avoid detection by innate immunity and (2) viral RNA m6A can serve as a target to attenuate HMPV for vaccine purposes."

Here, using human metapneumovirus (HMPV) as a model, we demonstrate that m6A serves as a molecular marker for innate immune discrimination of self from non-self RNAs. We show that HMPV RNAs are m6A methylated and that viral m6A methylation promotes HMPV replication and gene expression. Inactivating m6A addition sites with synonymous mutations or demethylase resulted in m6A-deficient recombinant HMPVs and virion RNAs that induced increased expression of type I interferon, which was dependent on the cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I, and not on melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Mechanistically, m6A-deficient virion RNA induces higher expression of RIG-I, binds more efficiently to RIG-I and facilitates the conformational change of RIG-I, leading to enhanced interferon expression. Furthermore, m6A-deficient recombinant HMPVs triggered increased interferon in vivo and were attenuated in cotton rats but retained high immunogenicity. Collectively, our results highlight that (1) viruses acquire m6A in their RNA as a means of mimicking cellular RNA to avoid detection by innate immunity and (2) viral RNA m6A can serve as a target to attenuate HMPV for vaccine purposes."

            "Highly purified HMPV virions were disrupted by detergent, digested with RNase, and the RNase-resistant viral nucleocapsid (N-RNA complex) was pulled down by HMPV N antibody. Both genome and antigenome were detected in N-RNA complex by real-time RT-PCR (a-c). This demonstrates that both the genome and the antigenome are indeed encapsidated by N protein and packaged into HMPV virions. (a), Quantification of genome and antigenome in HMPV virions by real-time RT-PCR. Wild type HMPV was grown in T150 flasks of A549 cells and cell culture supernatant was collected at 40 hpi. HMPV was purified by 20% sucrose cushion, the virion pellet was resuspended in 100 \u00b5L NTE buffer, treated with RNase at room temperature for 30 min.The reaction system was diluted in 5 ml NTE buffer and the virion was pelleted down in SW55 Ti ultracentrifugation tube on 10% sucrose cushion and resuspended in 100 \u00b5L NTE buffer. (b), Pull down of N-RNA complex by N antibody. RNase-treated virion was disrupted by 10 \u00d7 Disruption Buffer, mixed with Protein A/G Magnetic beads (MilliPore, LSKMAGAG02) bound with mouse anti-HMPV N antibody (MiiliPore, MAB80138) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h and washed with TBS buffer for 3 times. The beads were then subjected for Western blot. (c), Quantification of genome and antigenome in N-RNA complex by real-time RT-PCR.
