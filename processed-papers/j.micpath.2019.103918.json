        "abstract": "Aeromonas veronii is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes significant economic losses in the aquaculture industry. The use of probiotics in aquaculture is a practical alternative to antibiotics to promote animal health and aid in disease prevention. In the present study, we aimed to construct a recombinant Lactobacillus casei(surface-displayed or secretory) strain containing Malt from A. veronii TH0426 and assess its potential as an oral vaccine. A 1314-bp Malt gene fragment was successfully amplified and cloned into a prokaryotic protein expression system. Protein expression in resulting recombinant strains Lc-MCS-Malt (surface-displayed) and Lc-pPG-Malt (secretory) was then verified by Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence. A single band was observed on the Western blots, with the molecular weight of the corresponding protein shown to be 48 kDa. Furthermore, a fluorescent signal for Lc-MCS-Malt was observed by fluorescence microscopy. At 0, 7, 16, 25, and 34 days post-immunization, tissue and blood samples were collected from common carp orally administered with the recombinant L. casei strains for immune-related index analyses. Treatment of common carp with the recombinant vaccine candidate stimulated high serum or skin mucus specific antibody titers and induced a higher lysozyme, ACP, SOD activity, while fish fed with Lc-pPG or PBS had no detectable immobilizing immune responses. Expression of IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 genes in the group immunized with recombinant L. casei were significantly (P L. casei could stimulate the mucosa through colonization of the intestine, resulting in increased transcription of IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3. Immunity and colonization assays also showed that after 34 days of fasting, recombinant L. casei were still present in the intestines of the immunized fish. Common carp that received Lc-MCS-Malt(53.3%) and Lc-pPG-Malt (46.7%) exhibited higher survival rates than the controls after challenge with the pathogen A. veronii. Our findings suggested that recombinant L. casei can adequately protect fish and improve immunity, providing a theoretical basis for the future development of an oral Lactobacillus vaccine for use in aquaculture.",
