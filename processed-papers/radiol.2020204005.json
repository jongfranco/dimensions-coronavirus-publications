        "abstract": "In this issue of Radiology, Dr Jeff Kanne and co-authors present their updated information for radiologists regarding COVID-19 (1), presenting a brief synopsis of the imaging literature on COVID-19 in relationship to use of chest CT. The basis for this inaugural Radiology Scientific Expert Panel statement was an extraordinary number of research manuscripts submitted over the last several weeks on novel coronavirus (nCoV) emerging from Wuhan, China, later renamed COVID-19. With the emergence of chest CT to detect COVID-19 infection, Radiology has received more than 230 manuscripts on COVID-19 alone in the past 4 weeks. To put these numbers into perspective, we receive s that number of manuscripts on all topics throughout the entire field of radiology over a typical 4 week period. The standard academic peer process of publication is slow; authors know time from submission to s publication can take 6\u201312 months. Although this journal has developed methods to shorten the time to publication for priority topics (called \u201cfast track\u201d), prior Radiology publications on Ebola or SARS infections still took up to 3 months to appear online. We determined that our existing processes for publication were insufficient to rapidly respond to a fastre progressing infectious disease. At the same time, we saw a more than 10-fold increase in reviewer and editorial staff burden for manuscripts on COVID-19. In response, our editorial board developed and put in place new processes for rapid editorial and peer review for COVID-19 manuscripts, along with daily briefings of editorial board, publication, and marketing staff. Beginning in June 2019, our Radiology editorial board retreat focused on a gap in our field pertaining to emerging areas of radiologic imaging. There is often insufficient information in the literature for wellformed medical guidelines, and niche topics\u2014of critical importance to developing fields\u2014may flounder",
