        "abstract": "Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is the major cause of severe hand-foot-and-mouth diseases (HFMD), especially encephalitis and other nervous system diseases. EV-A71 capsid protein VP1 mediates virus attachment and is the important virulence factor in the EVA71pathogenesis. In this study, we explored the roles of VP1 in the permeability of blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Sera albumin, Evans blue, and dextran leaked into brain parenchyma of the 1-week-old C57BL/6J mice intracranially injected with VP1 recombinant protein. VP1 also increased the permeability of the brain endothelial cells monolayer, an in vitro BBB model. Tight junction protein claudin-5 was reduced in the brain tissues or brain endothelial cells treated with VP1. In contrast, VP1 increased the expression of virus receptor vimentin, which could be blocked with VP1 neutralization antibody. Vimentin expression in the VP1-treated brain endothelial cells was regulated by TGF-\u03b2/Smad-3 and NF-\u03baB signal pathways. Moreover, vimentin over-expression was accompanied with compromised BBB. From these studies, we conclude that EV-A71 virus capsid protein VP1 disrupted BBB and increased virus receptor vimentin, which both may contribute to the virus entrance into brain and EV-A71 CNS infection.",

Fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013dextran (FD4) and Evans blue in the brain parenchyma may also indicate the BBB impairment (Saunders et al 2015). VP1 significantly promoted the FD4 and Evans blue leakage into brain parenchyma (Fig. 1c, d), implying that VP1 directly disrupt the integrity of BBB. Tight junction is essential in the maintenance of BBB integrity. In the brain parenchyma treated with VP1 or saline, the expression of ZO-1 was comparable. Claudin-5 expression, however, was markedly reduced in the brain tissues treated with VP1 (Fig. 1e)."

        "discussion": [
            "Due to the fatal CNS syndrome in the infants, EV-A71 was considered as an important neurotropic virus (Rasti et al 2019). Though inactivated virus vaccine eliciting safe and protective response against EV-A71 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2014_a\">Li et al 2014</a>) has been approved, the pathogenesis of EV-A71 CNS infection is still incompletely understood. In the present study, we demonstrated EV-A71 capsid protein VP1 directly damaged BBB integrity with the reduced claudin-5. Meanwhile, VP1 increased the virus receptor vimentin on brain endothelial cells through TGF-/Smad3 and NF-\u03baB signal pathways. In addition, vimentin over-expression may lead to the increased leakage of BBB.<br/><br/>BBB impairment has been documented in patients infected with HIV-1 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAnesten_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rAnesten_et+al_2016_a\">Anesten et al 2016</a>), Japanese encephalitis virus (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2015_a\">Li et al 2015a</a>), and other neurotropic viruses (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSpindler_2012_a\" href=\"#rSpindler_2012_a\">Spindler and Hsu 2012</a>). Similar with HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 compromised BBB integrity (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cKanmogne_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rKanmogne_et+al_2007_a\">Kanmogne et al 2007</a>), EV-A71 capsid protein VP1 damaged the intact BBB, which was demonstrated with elevated albumin and dextran in the brain parenchyma. Albumin (~ 65 kD), Evans blue, and fluorescence dextran (3~5 kD) were surrogate makers for the BBB impairment (Saunders et al 2015). In the EV-A71 patients (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2010_a\">Huang et al 2010</a>) or neonatal mice (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJin_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rJin_et+al_2018_a\">Jin et al 2018</a>), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was significantly increased, which may decrease claudin-5 expression on brain endothelial cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cArgaw_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rArgaw_et+al_2009_a\">Argaw et al 2009</a>). In the line with compromised BBB, tight junction protein claudin-5 in the mice treated with VP1 was decreased. As a major tight junction protein in brain endothelial cells, claudin-5 was unique in the selective regulation of small molecules (< 800 D) across BBB (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNitta_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rNitta_et+al_2003_a\">Nitta et al 2003</a>). Therefore, decreased expression of claudin-5 on brain endothelial cells may be not the sole reason for the VP1 induced leakage of albumin (~ 65 kD) and fluorescence dextran (3~5 kD) into brain parenchyma. We hypothesized that decreased claudin-5 and other factors may jointly contribute to the BBB impairment."

To explore the direct roles of VP1 in the EV-A71 pathogenesis, the recombinant VP1 protein was intracranially instilled into brain parenchyma. With the damage of BBB, albumin from blood may leak into brain tissues (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBanks_et+al_2000_a\" href=\"#rBanks_et+al_2000_a\">Banks et al 2000</a>). Expectedly, VP1 caused the elevation of albumin in the brain parenchyma (Fig. 1a, b). Fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013dextran (FD4) and Evans blue in the brain parenchyma may also indicate the BBB impairment (Saunders et al 2015). VP1 significantly promoted the FD4 and Evans blue leakage into brain parenchyma (Fig. 1c, d), implying that VP1 directly disrupt the integrity of BBB. Tight junction is essential in the maintenance of BBB integrity. In the brain parenchyma treated with VP1 or saline, the expression of ZO-1 was comparable. Claudin-5 expression, however, was markedly reduced in the brain tissues treated with VP1 (Fig. 1e).",
            "In vitro, with the brain endothelial cells growth and the formation of tight junctions, trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the integrity of endothelial cell monolayer are gradually increased. Compared with normal saline, VP1 significantly decreased TEER, suggesting that VP1 damaged the BBB integrity (Fig. 2a).",
            "Under the transmission electron microscope, VP1 damaged the tight junctions between endothelia cells (Fig. 2b). Similar with in vivo observation, VP1 directly decreased claudin-5 in the brain endothelial cells in vitro (Fig. 2c), implying that claudin-5 may be the key target in the VP1-induced BBB leakage. ZO-1 expression in the different groups was similar (Fig. 2d). In sum, VP1 caused the reduction of tight junction protein claudin-5 and disruption of BBB.",
            "The increased permeability of BBB suggested that EV-A71 may gain the entrance into brain via the transcellular pathway.",
            "Besides the transcellular route, EV-A71 may bind with virus receptors and infect the endothelial cell. In the brain tissues treated with VP1, EV-A71 receptor vimentin was significantly increased (Fig. 3a, b). In the immunohistochemistry analysis, vimentin was widely distributed in brain tissues and significantly increased upon VP1 challenge (Fig. 3c). In contrast, EV-A71 receptors SCARB2, HSP-70, and PSGL-1 on the brain tissues treated with VP1 were almost unchanged, and Annexin II was even decreased (Fig. 3d, e), suggesting that vimentin may contribute to the VP1-meidated aggravation of EV-A71 CNS infection.",

            "Due to the fatal CNS syndrome in the infants, EV-A71 was considered as an important neurotropic virus (Rasti et al 2019).

In the present study, we demonstrated EV-A71 capsid protein VP1 directly damaged BBB integrity with the reduced claudin-5. Meanwhile, VP1 increased the virus receptor vimentin on brain endothelial cells through TGF-/Smad3 and NF-\u03baB signal pathways. In addition, vimentin over-expression may lead to the increased leakage of BBB.",
            "BBB impairment has been documented in patients infected with HIV-1 (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cAnesten_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rAnesten_et+al_2016_a\">Anesten et al 2016</a>), Japanese encephalitis virus (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLi_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rLi_et+al_2015_a\">Li et al 2015a</a>), and other neurotropic viruses (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSpindler_2012_a\" href=\"#rSpindler_2012_a\">Spindler and Hsu 2012</a>).

            "demonstrated with elevated albumin and dextran in the brain parenchyma. Albumin (~ 65 kD), Evans blue, and fluorescence dextran (3~5 kD) were surrogate makers for the BBB impairment (Saunders et al 2015). In the EV-A71 patients (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHuang_et+al_2010_a\" href=\"#rHuang_et+al_2010_a\">Huang et al 2010</a>) or neonatal mice (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cJin_et+al_2018_a\" href=\"#rJin_et+al_2018_a\">Jin et al 2018</a>), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was significantly increased, which may decrease claudin-5 expression on brain endothelial cells (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cArgaw_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rArgaw_et+al_2009_a\">Argaw et al 2009</a>). In the line with compromised BBB, tight junction protein claudin-5 in the mice treated with VP1 was decreased. As a major tight junction protein in brain endothelial cells, claudin-5 was unique in the selective regulation of small molecules (< 800 D) across BBB (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNitta_et+al_2003_a\" href=\"#rNitta_et+al_2003_a\">Nitta et al 2003</a>). Therefore, decreased expression of claudin-5 on brain endothelial cells may be not the sole reason for the VP1 induced leakage of albumin (~ 65 kD) and fluorescence dextran (3~5 kD) into brain parenchyma. We hypothesized that decreased claudin-5 and other factors may jointly contribute to the BBB impairment.",
            "With the elevated leakage of BBB, EV-A71 viron may paracellularly invade the brain parenchyma through the abnormally loosened tight junctions.

In the consideration that endothelial cells, vimentin is utilized by various viruses, including at least cowpea mosaic virus (Koudelka et al 2009), dengue virus (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYang_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rYang_et+al_2016_a\">Yang et al 2016</a>), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cYu_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rYu_et+al_2016_a\">Yu et al 2016</a>), we speculated that VP1 may exploit endothelial cells and vimentin. In the accordance with the above speculation, VP1 activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad-3/NF-\u03baB pathways, leading to the increased expression of vimentin in brain endothelial cells. The exact mechanisms of VP1 upregulating vimentin on brain endothelia cells, however, warranted further elucidation. Besides the virus receptor, vimentin also functioned as intracellular chaperone for EV-A71 protein 2C and promoted virus survival (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cGladue_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rGladue_et+al_2013_a\">Gladue et al 2013</a>).

No matter how vimentin was involved with EV-A71 pathogenesis, our results provided the possibility that EV-A71 may transcellularly transmigrate across BBB via the vimentin attachment on the brain endothelial cells.",
