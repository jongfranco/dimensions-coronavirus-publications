The main objective of this paper is to create and implement a new graphical simulator to monitoring COVID-19 behavior in real time worldwide faster and effectively. This new multidimensional graphical simulator is entitled \u201cThe Mega-Disks Networks Infection Diseases Control Mapping Simulator (MDNIDC-Mapping Simulator).\u201d The MDNIDC-Mapping Simulator offers a new multidimensional graphical mathematical simulator that can help to follow the COVID-19 infected cases under a micro-level and macro-level. Finally, we provide a new graphical tool that can help in the control and calculate possible COVID-19 infected cases at China or worldwide efficiently.",
