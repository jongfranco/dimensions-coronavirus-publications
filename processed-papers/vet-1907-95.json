        "abstract": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) as a notable disease of poultry flocks results in economic losses.\nAs a consequence of the presence of various infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) serotypes, control strategies such as vaccination have been challenged to provide broad protective immunity against the disease to this time. Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles so-called bacterium like particles (BLPs), obtained from the bacterium Lactococcus lactis\n(L.lactis), have demonstrated adjuvancy effect by providing demanding mucosal and humoral immune responses as well as a protective cellular immunity whenever delivered admixed with a vaccine through intranasal (i.n) or intraocular (i.o) routes. In this study, for the first time, attempts are made to investigate the impact of an IBV vaccine supplemented by various doses of BLPs on induced levels of humoral immunity against the disease. For this purpose, the increasing doses of derived BLPs (0, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 mg dry weight per bird) were admixed with IBV live attenuated H120 serotype vaccine and were then administered by the ocular route to four equal groups of 10 specific pathogen-free (SPF)",

In this study, for the first time, attempts are made to investigate the impact of an IBV vaccine supplemented by various doses of BLPs on induced levels of humoral immunity against the disease. For this purpose, the increasing doses of derived BLPs (0, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 mg dry weight per bird) were admixed with IBV live attenuated H120 serotype vaccine and were then administered by the ocular route to four equal groups of 10 specific pathogen-free (SPF)",

            "Negligible differences in the amino acid sequence of the S1 subunit gene in addition to the recombination between IBV strains result in the emergence of multiple new variants which are not cross-protected. Apparently, the use of live attenuated vaccine types or the presence of multiple concurrent infections of different IBV serotypes also contributes to this recombination process. Thus, some countries only allow vaccination with one or a few vaccine types, which makes strategies of preventing IB even more complicated. As a consequence, controlling IB has never completely achieved to this time [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>].",
            "It has been revealed that while no association exists between circulating antibodies and IB protection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>], both local antibody response and cell-mediated immunity correlates greatly with protection, nevertheless, monitoring IgG antibodies still remains as an important method to evaluate the immune response to an IBV challenge [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
            "IB could initially be prevented by considering vaccination and biosecurity methods.",
            "Immunization by either live or inactivated vaccines of various serotypes is recognized as the main control strategy against IB. Due to the requirements of multiple immunizations, large doses of adjuvants as well as live priming, application of inactivated vaccines is costly and even less efficient compared to live types. Existence of far many IBV strains along with their antigenic alterations is a huge burden to a high protective immunization. To develop an efficient anti-IBV vaccine, factors such as age, maternally derived antibodies (MDAs) and immune-competence of the bird along with immunogenicity of the vaccine, the virulence, and type of the challenge strain, as well as the interval between vaccination and challenge, should be noticed. Correspondingly, various novel promising IB vaccines have been developed; however, their application in the field has been challenged through the existing drawbacks such as low efficiency and immunogenicity of DNA and peptide vaccines respectively as well as a safety concerns about cytotoxicity of the components of nanoparticle vaccine delivery along with difficulty in maintaining stability and displaying antigens on nanoparticles [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>].",

BLPs are derived from L. lactis, a non-pathogenic gram-positive bacterium, considered as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) organism.",
            "As BLPs are in size of a bacterium, their uptake by membranous cells (M-cells) is facilitated [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>]. Reducing secondary effects, applicability for either a monovalent or a polyvalent vaccine along with decreasing bacterial colonization and amplification in lungs, being easily administered for mass immunization, not requiring booster immunization, triggering both systemic and mucosal immune system, possessing higher binding capacity as well as less anti-carrier response compared to living LAB are all of their advantages [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Surprisingly, their capacity for being kept with no need for the cold chain for a long time is also noticeable [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. BLPs are able to reduce bacterial loads in lungs [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>]. Additionally, It has been found out that when secondary bacterial infection also exists, the mortality of young chickens caused by IBV is higher [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Thus, BLPs could probably be of great advantage against mortality from the disease, particularly in chickens of young ages.",
            "In the current experiment, firstly, the influence of BLPs admixed with an IBV vaccine delivered through ocular route on levels of anti-IBV serum IgGs of SPF chickens are investigated and secondly, attempts are made to discover the proper dose of BLPs that induces the best humoral immune response against IB.

            "An Argument exists whether antibodies are involved in preventing from IB or not. In a study by Feng et al, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], it was revealed that local and cellular immunity but not humoral immunity are involved in protection against IBV. Also, it has been shown by Bru et al, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] that anti-",
            "IBV antibodies are not always associated with protection; Nevertheless, it has been shown that locally-produced anti-IBV IgGs induced by secondary vaccination plays a role in protection against IBV, specifically in controlling chronic infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. In another study by Orr-Burks et al, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>], it was demonstrated that anti-IBV IgA titers are more correlated with protection compared to anti-IBV IgG titers; however, it was indicated that tear antibody levels are not considered as an accurate parameter of protection against IB. Furthermore, Lopes et al, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] stated that elicited mucosal IgG and IgA antibodies at respiratory tract as well as CMI responses are important factors in preventing IBV replication and protection against ciliostasis and lesions of the trachea. It is assumed that IgGs are involved in the protection of oviducts in layers and by neutralizing IBV serum antigens, result in prevention from persistency of IBV in chicken [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>]. In a recent attempt, there exists evidence that ovaries degenerated considerably less in the group that received inactivated boost after a live vaccine than the group receiving only a live vaccine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Feng et al, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] stated that monitoring IgGs is of crucial importance in evaluating the immune response to an IBV challenge. In another study, the evaluation of serum antibodies for predicting the potency of live IBV vaccination was mentioned improper since antibody titer levels induced by vaccination in young age are low; however, this method was preferred by regulatory authorities over performing in vivo protection studies [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Despite all the interpretations, because the Immune status of poultry flocks are commonly assessed by serologic assays, we, therefore, considered the measurement of serum antibodies (IgGs) in the design of this study.",
            "Some researchers believe that the presence of maternally derived antibodies (MDAs) impairs active immunization following day-old vaccination [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]; Nevertheless, some studies showed that MDAs do not impair IBV vaccination since local immunity is probably of far more importance and serum antibodies are not involved in this response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]. In a later experiment, transferring of B and T cell subpopulations to the upper respiratory tract was not observed in SPF chickens. Thus, Despite minor neutralizing vaccine antigens, MDA has no huge influence over responses induced by an IBV vaccine unless of being administered at hatch day [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. In a study by van Ginkel et al, it was purposed that early immunization could not afford expected innate and adaptive immune responses. Chickens vaccinated on days 1, 7 or of age displayed delayed serum antibody response. Furthermore, lower antibody production and IgG avidity index along with increased tracheal inflammation and subsequently lower protection were all found in the group vaccinated at day old compared to the groups vaccinated at later days. Thus, immunization after a week of birth was proposed as an alternative for the day-old vaccination. As the lack of TLR expression in day-old chickens are probably the cause of lower antibody affinity maturation and subsequently lower protection, therefore, exploiting a TLR activating adjuvant is suggested to boost antibody production and to elevate affinity maturation in day-old chickens which could consequently pave challenges of vaccination in early age [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Above all these investigations, we determined to apply day-old vaccination for the birds since it is routinely performed in poultry flocks of Iran at the moment.",

Neonatal DCs, CD4 and CD8 stimulation as well as pro-inflammatory and Th1 polarizing cytokines secretion in favour of biased Th1 type T cell response [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] along with their role in Th17 activation through TLR2 dependent manner make their activity potent even in conditions of being simply mixed with",

On the whole, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, because of their immune stimulation potency, are noted as efficient future adjuvants [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. Thus, Tolllike receptor 2 (TLR2) mediating activity of BLPs in addition to their safety properties turn them to an eligible candidate as a promising alternative adjuvant for an IBV vaccine.",
            "Other successful applications of BLPs in previous studies include, the prevention of bacterial infections in early life by Lactococcus lactis germ particles carrying vaccine antigens [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]; Germ particles acting as a potent adjuvant for intranasal influenza immunization [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]; BLP adjuvanted influenza vaccine, delivered through intranasal route, enhancing systemic and local antibody responses against influenza, leading to protective resistance against homologous or heterologous infection compared to conventional intramuscular immunization [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]; Intranasal vaccination of mice or cotton rats with BLPs resulting in potent induction of recombinant fusion (F) protein-specific immunoglobulins and a significant decrease of virus titers in lungs upon Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) challenge [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]; Nasal immunization by BLP mixed with split influenza vaccine (BLP-SV) inducing influenza A virus (IAV) - specific T cell and B cell responses both systemically and at the site of virus entry in a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) dependent manner [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]; Shigella invasion plasmid antigen B and D (IPaB / IPaD), displayed on BLP of L. lactis, inducing protective immunity in adult and infant mice [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]; Pneumococcal surface protein, bound with protein anchor of BLPs (BLPs / PspA-PA), efficiently inducing IgG and IgA levels and providing the complete protection in mouse challenged with pneumococci of different PspA families [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]; The Intranasal pertussis vaccine with BLP adjuvant enhancing immune responses and protected mice from an intranasal challenge and pathological injury [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]; and lately, the BLP based pneumococcal vaccine, displaying PspA2 and PspA4 fragments, inducing broad protective immune responses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. To the best of our knowledge, this experiment is the first attempt toward the application of BLPs as a novel adjuvant for vaccines in the poultry industry. Evidently, the results of the present study are in agreement with the previous ones that BLPs is a robust adjuvant for vaccines.",
            "This study was a novel and primary attempt to understand supplemented with a vaccine against IB. Evaluation of mucosal and cellular immunity influenced by BLPs-adjuvanted IBV vaccine was not considered in this experiment despite their substantial duty in protection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Challenges were not also performed herein, although they are essential to estimate the real potency of the applied BLPs-adjuvanted vaccine against a field strain [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. Thus, to further understand the immune system stimulating potency of the BLPs-adjuvanted vaccine, studies consisted of challenges along with evaluating levels of immunity other than humoral in addition to viral load detection as well as ciliostasis and histopathology investigations are suggested. In summary, it could be concluded that admixing low doses of BLPs such as 0.15 mg dry weight of BLPs per bird with a live H120 IBV vaccine are capable of rapidly boosting higher anti-IBV serum IgG titer levels than a non-adjuvanted live IBV vaccine even in the second week of the life of a chicken."
