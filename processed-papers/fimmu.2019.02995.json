        "abstract": "To investigate CTL epitope applications in swine, SLA-1\u22171502-restricted peptide epitopes matching porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strains were explored by crystallography, biochemistry, and the specific pathogen-free (SPF) swine experiments. First, nine predicted PRRSV peptides were tested by assembly of the peptide-SLA-1\u22171502 (pSLA-1\u22171502) complexes, and the crystal structure of the SLA-1\u22171502 complex with one peptide (NSP9-TMP9) was determined. The NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation presented by pSLA-1\u22171502 is different from that of the peptides presented by the known pSLA-1\u22170401 and pSLA-3\u2217hs0202 complexes. Two consecutive Pro residues make the turn between P3 and P4 of NSP9-TMP9 much sharper. The D pocket of pSLA-1\u22171502 is unique and is important for peptide binding. Next, the potential SLA-1\u22171502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified based on the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1\u22171502 determined by structural analysis and alanine scanning of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide. The tetrameric complex of SLA-1\u22171502 and NSP9-TMP9 was constructed and examined. Finally, taking NSP9-TMP9 as an example, the CTL immunogenicity of the identified PRRSV peptide epitope was evaluated. The SPF swine expressing the SLA-1\u22171502 alleles were divided into three groups: modified live vaccine (MLV), MLV+NSP9-TMP9, and the blank control group. NSP9-TMP9 was determined as a PRRSV CTL epitope with strong immunogenicity by flow cytometry and IFN-\u03b3 expression. Our study developed an integrated approach to identify SLA-I-restricted CTL epitopes from various important viruses and is helpful in designing and applying effective peptide-based vaccines for swine.",

            "In conclusion, we solved the crystal structure of SLA-1\u22171502 and described its PRRSV peptide-binding map according to its preliminary peptide-binding motif determined via biochemical analyses. Using the tetramer of SLA-1\u22171502, the immunogenicity of NSP9-TMP9 was identified by FACS and the expression of IFN-\u03b3. The results increase our understanding of how to acquire a viral CTL vaccine against swine PRRS disease. In addition, this study provides a complete and credible method for identifying SLA-I-restricted viral epitopes, demonstrating the feasibility of peptide vaccines in antiviral immunity of swine. Based on our experimental results, we encourage and promote the development of a safe peptide vaccine that can effectively activate CTL immune protection, solve the safety problems caused by conventional attenuated vaccines, and provide new ideas for controlling not only PRRS but also the extent of African swine fever."

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most important swine pathogens and has caused significant economic losses in the swine industry worldwide for two decades [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. PRRSV is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus with a viral genome of \u223c15 kb in length and contains 11 open reading frames (ORFs) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>].

Eight relatively small genes following ORF1 in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction encode four membrane-associated glycoproteins, three membrane proteins, and a nucleocapsid protein.

SLA1\u22171502 showed better PRRSV peptide-binding ability than the others (Table S1) according to in silico prediction (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan). Nine PRRSV peptides, all of which could be presented by SLA-1\u22171502, were synthesized to test this prediction (Table 1). All nine peptides could form complexes with SLA-1\u22171502 and swine \u03b22m (pSLA-1\u22171502) by in vitro refolding. The stable pSLA-1\u22171502 complexes were further used to screen the crystal structures.<br/><br/>SLA-1\u22171502 in complex with NSP9-TMP9 was crystallized in the P212121 space group with a high resolution of 2.20 \u00c5 (Table 2). One asymmetric unit contains only one SLA-1\u22171502 molecule. The pSLA-1\u22171502 complex displays a canonical p/MHC I structure, including the \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 domains of the HC and the light chain s\u03b22m. NSP9-TMP9 is located in the peptide-binding groove (PBG) formed by the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains (Figure 1A). The root mean square differences (RMSDs) between SLA-1\u22171502 and two other solved p/SLA I structures (SLA-1\u22170401, PDB code: 3QQ3; SLA-3\u2217hs0202, PDB code: 5H94) were found to be 0.446 and 0.592, respectively, indicating similarities among the overall structures of the p/SLA I molecules. The NSP9-TMP9 peptide is fixed by 15 hydrogen bonds with residues in the N- and Ctermini of the PBG, and no hydrogen bonds were observed in the middle portion (P3\u2013P7) (Figure 1B). Based on the surface model, the P4 and P8 residues are located outside the PBG, and their side chains are solvent accessible, especially the P8 residue, which is at the top position of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation (Figure 1C)."

There are considerable challenges and specific requirements in the development of novel vaccines to prevent PRRS, such as the CTL-epitope vaccine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",
            "The greatest challenge is that PRRSV can markedly suppress the swine immune defense system [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]. The current evaluation of the PRRSV vaccine is based on its induced antibody response. Although high antibody titers can be produced after immunization, protection is not ideal because the key neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against PRRSV appear late, typically >28 days post-infection (dpi), and usually at low levels [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. Furthermore, NAbs are usually specific for the homologous PRRSV strain and confer little cross-protection against heterologous strains [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Regarding CTL-mediated immunity, specific CTL responses have been observed in PRRSV [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. The virulent type 1 (Lena) PRRSV resulted in increased IL-1\u03b1 production and a higher percentage of CD8+ T cells and IFN\u03b3-producing cells compared with controls. Cross-reactivity against divergent PRRSV is also associated with cytotoxic CD8+IFN\u03b3 and CD8\u2013IFN\u03b3+ cells to a different extent [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. PRRSV-specific T cells could be observed as early as 2 weeks after infection, with the viral loads decreasing in persistent infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. Modified live vaccines (MLVs) could induce CTL immune responses and confer better protection against heterologous PRRSV strains than inactivated PRRS vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>]. These findings indicate that specific CD8+ CTL immunity may play an important role in controlling PRRSV infection. However, there is limited clear and direct evidence of CTLs eliminating PRRSV infection, and more basic immune reagents, such as the tetramer of swine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I with PRRSV peptide epitope, are required to address these important issues [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",
            "Swine MHC class I has been referred to as swine lymphocyte antigen (SLA-I). There are three classical SLA-I loci (SLA1, SLA-2, and SLA-3) in the swine genome, and all are dominantly expressed [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. SLA-I molecules can present viral peptide epitopes to swine CD8+ T cells and induce the CTL response to kill the infected cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Similar to human MHC (also known as human leukocyte antigen, HLA), SLAI molecules are a highly polymorphic gene superfamily whose peptide-binding specificities are significantly influenced by highly variable sites [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]. Thus, far, more than 100 SLA-I genes have been cloned (IPD; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/index.html), and two three-dimensional (3D) structures of peptide-SLA-I (p/SLA-I) molecules have been determined, revealing the peptide presentation characteristics of SLA-I molecules in swine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. Thus, the situation is favorable for the design and development of a novel viral CTL vaccine against swine PRRS based on these 3D structures of SLA-I molecules.",
            "In an attempt to identify anti-PRRSV CTL epitopes in this study, first, predicted peptide epitopes derived from PRRSV were synthesized, and a trimolecular complex, the structure of the epitope from PRRSV-NSP9 (TMPPGFELY, termed NSP9TMP9)-bound SLA-1\u22171502 (pSLA-1\u22171502), was solved. Next, the potential SLA-1\u22171502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified. Finally, the immunogenicity of the CTL epitope was identified. Our results provide a novel strategy, i.e., the use of the MHC-restricted structural mechanism, to identify and validate CTL epitopes that could be used to develop a peptide-based vaccine against swine PRRS."

All nine peptides could form complexes with SLA-1\u22171502 and swine \u03b22m (pSLA-1\u22171502) by in vitro refolding. The stable pSLA-1\u22171502 complexes were further used to screen the crystal structures.",
            "SLA-1\u22171502 in complex with NSP9-TMP9 was crystallized in the P212121 space group with a high resolution of 2.20 \u00c5 (Table 2). One asymmetric unit contains only one SLA-1\u22171502 molecule. The pSLA-1\u22171502 complex displays a canonical p/MHC I structure, including the \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 domains of the HC and the light chain s\u03b22m. NSP9-TMP9 is located in the peptide-binding groove (PBG) formed by the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains (Figure 1A). The root mean square differences (RMSDs) between SLA-1\u22171502 and two other solved p/SLA I structures (SLA-1\u22170401, PDB code: 3QQ3; SLA-3\u2217hs0202, PDB code: 5H94) were found to be 0.446 and 0.592, respectively, indicating similarities among the overall structures of the p/SLA I molecules. The NSP9-TMP9 peptide is fixed by 15 hydrogen bonds with residues in the N- and Ctermini of the PBG, and no hydrogen bonds were observed in the middle portion (P3\u2013P7) (Figure 1B). Based on the surface model, the P4 and P8 residues are located outside the PBG, and their side chains are solvent accessible, especially the P8 residue, which is at the top position of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation (Figure 1C).",
            "The compositions and polarities of the six pockets of pSLA1\u22171502 are shown in Figure 2, and the interactions between the NSP9-TMP9 peptide and these pockets are listed in Table 3. The pockets of pSLA-1\u22171502, p/SLA-1\u22170401, and p/SLA-3\u2217hs0202 are compared in Figure 3. The A pocket of pSLA-1\u22171502, composed of Leu5, Tyr7, Phe33, Tyr59, Glu63, Tyr159, Leu163, Ser167, and Tyr171, fixes P1-Thr via hydrogen bonds and strong van der Waals forces (VDWs) (Figure 2A; Table 3). The residues forming the A pockets of SLA I molecules, including Ser167, are highly conserved (Figure 3). In most MHC I molecules of other",
            "species, the residue at position 167 is Trp [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>]. Due to the small Ser167 residue, the N-terminus of the PBG of SLA I molecules appears to be more open than in other MHC I molecules.",

The charged Glu63 and Lys66 residues at the top of the B pocket can form two hydrogen bonds with the main chain of P2-Met. The hydrophobic B pocket accommodates the non-polar side chain of P2-Met via the VDWs provided by the surrounding residues (Figure 2B; Table 3). The residue composition of SLA-1\u22171502 is similar to that of SLA-1\u22170401, and only the residue at position 66 (Lys/Val) is different (Figure 3).",

The amino acid compositions of these three pockets in SLA-1\u22171502 are shown in Figures 2C\u2013E. No hydrogen bonds or salt bridges were found in these structures; instead, many VDWs were observed between the three pockets and the NSP9-TMP9 peptide (Table 3). The D pocket is critical for the peptide selection of SLA-1\u22170401 and SLA-3\u2217hs0202 because of the charged residue at position 156 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. The non-polar Met156 causes the D pocket of SLA-1\u22171502 to be hydrophobic, in contrast to the charged D pocket of SLA-1\u22170401 or SLA-3\u2217hs0202 (Figure 3).",

P9-Tyr can form 6 hydrogen bonds and many VDWs with the residues of the F pocket (Table 3). The F pockets of both pSLA-1\u22171502 and p/SLA1\u22170401 can accommodate P9-Tyr, and only two different residues (Asn/Gly77 and Ala/Thr80) were found between the two F pockets (Figure 3).",

Because of the two consecutive Pro residues, the turn between P3 and P4 of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide is much sharper than that in the other two peptides (Figures 4A,B). Previous studies on SLA-1\u22170401 and SLA-3\u2217hs0202 showed that the residue at position 156 plays a key role in peptide binding by fixing the P3 residue with a salt bridge or hydrogen bond (Figures 4C,D).

The in vitro refolding and CD results showed that the binding stabilities of P2-Ala, P3-Ala, and P9-Ala mutant peptides are significantly lower than that of the wild-type NSP9-TMP9 peptide. Although P3-Pro cannot form a hydrogen bond or salt bridge with the D pocket of SLA-1\u22171502, its Ala mutant still impairs the stability of the pSLA-1\u22171502 complex. According to these results, the P2, P3, and P9 residues are the primary anchor residues of the epitope peptides presented by SLA-1\u22171502. The B, D and F pockets accommodate these primary anchor residues and determine the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1\u22171502, similar to SLA-1\u22170401 and SLA-3\u2217hs0202.",
            "The B and F pockets accommodate the P2 and P9 anchor residues of the binding peptide, respectively, and their preference for P2 and P9 anchor residues is determined by their amino acid composition. Figure 2 shows the pocket composition of SLA-1\u22171502. Figure 3 shows that the amino acid composition of the B and F pockets of SLA-1\u22171502 is very similar to that of SLA-1\u22170401. Differential amino acids are found only at one or two individual sites and do not form direct contacts with the side chains of the P2 or P9 residues of the binding peptide. Because of the similar B and F pockets, the P2 and P9 residues of the SLA-1\u22171502-binding peptides should be the same as in the SLA-1\u22170401 peptides. The SLA-1\u22170401 binding peptide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] and the SLA-1\u22171502 binding peptide have a large overlap at the P2 and P9 residues (Table 1). The B pocket of SLA-1\u22171502 accommodates multiple uncharged residues, while the F pocket mainly binds Phe, Tyr and Trp. The in vitro refolding results for the peptides supported this reasonable speculation (Table 1). The uncharged D pocket of SLA-1\u22171502 might accommodate various uncharged P3 residues, unlike those of SLA-1\u22170401 and SLA-3\u2217hs0202. Peptides with P3-Ala cannot provide sufficient affinity, unlike larger amino acids, such as L, M, F, S, N, and P (Table 1). In summary, the preliminary peptide-binding motif of SLA-1\u22171502 is expected to contain the following combination: X-(S/M/F/W/T/V/I/L)-(L/P/M/F/S/N)X-X-X-X-X-(F/Y/W).",

The crystal structure of SLA-1\u22171502 exhibits the typical structural characteristics of an MHC I complex. The structure of SLA-1\u22171502 is very similar to those of SLA-1\u22170401 and SLA-3\u2217hs0202, indicating that the overall combination of heavy chains, light chains, and peptides in the swine SLAI complex is highly conserved. However, in terms of peptide binding, the SLA-1\u22171502 structure not only reflects the common features of SLA-I alleles but also exhibits unique allelic-specific characteristics. Similar to the previously resolved SLA-1\u22170401 and SLA-3\u2217hs0202, the N-terminus of the SLA-1\u22171502 PBG is open because the amino acid at position 167 of the A pocket is a small Ser (Figure 2A), but in other species such as humans and mice, the amino acid at this position is a large Trp [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>].

            "and SLA-3\u2217hs0202, is determined by the three pockets B, D and F together, while the HLA-I molecule is mostly determined by the two pockets B and F. These common characteristics indicate that SLA-I has its own unique species features in binding peptides. In the B and F pocket composition, SLA-1\u22171502 and SLA-1\u22170401 are very similar, and only the non-critical amino acids in the individual positions are different (Figure 3), resulting in a large overlap of the anchoring residues accommodated in their B and F pockets [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. In the structures of SLA-1\u22170401 and SLA-3\u2217hs0202, the D pocket plays a key role in fixing the bound peptides, with a strong salt bridge between the charged residue 156 and the P3 residue of the peptides [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>].

Nevertheless, the D pocket is still important in determining the peptide binding of SLA-1\u22171502 and prefers uncharged residues of a certain size to form sufficient VDWs. The three p/SLA I structures indicate that regardless of its properties, the D pocket is critical in determining the peptide-binding motif of SLA-I, and this phenomenon is expected to be a common feature among different SLA-I alleles.",

Four typical PRRSV strains of the North American genotype were used to screen SLA-1\u22171502-restricted binding peptides.

In this study, the crystallized NSP9-TMP9 peptide was used to produce the tetramer for evaluating SLA-1\u22171502-restricted CTL responses. The NSP9TMP9 epitope could induce CD8 and tetramer double-positive CTLs at a rate of \u223c0.5\u20131% in MLV+NSP-TMP9-immunized pigs, similar to the results obtained for other known efficiently protective viral CTL epitopes found in humans and mice by FACS [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c49\" href=\"#r49\">49</a>]. Our results also showed that the MLV used (produced by the VR2332 strain) could induce a CTL response specific to PRRS. Somewhat disappointingly, we do not have live PRRSV with which to challenge these swine groups and evaluate the protection of MLV and NSP-TMP9 epitope. However, NSP9-TMP9 was identified as an immunogenic epitope that could stimulate the proliferation of specific CD8+ CTLs and the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in SPF Landrace pigs bearing SLA-1\u22171502 alleles. Immunization enhancement with",
            "NSP9-TMP9 produces a specific CTL response similar to that of immunization with MLV, indicating that the peptide vaccine can produce effective immunoprotection and thus that it is feasible to develop an effective PRRSV polypeptide epitope vaccine.",
            "In conclusion, we solved the crystal structure of SLA-1\u22171502 and described its PRRSV peptide-binding map according to its preliminary peptide-binding motif determined via biochemical analyses. Using the tetramer of SLA-1\u22171502, the immunogenicity of NSP9-TMP9 was identified by FACS and the expression of IFN-\u03b3. The results increase our understanding of how to acquire a viral CTL vaccine against swine PRRS disease. In addition, this study provides a complete and credible method for identifying SLA-I-restricted viral epitopes, demonstrating the feasibility of peptide vaccines in antiviral immunity of swine. Based on our experimental results, we encourage and promote the development of a safe peptide vaccine that can effectively activate CTL immune protection, solve the safety problems",
