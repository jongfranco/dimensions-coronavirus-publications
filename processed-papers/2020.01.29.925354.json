        "abstract": "Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulence-related genes in novel agents, as we show here for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, unknown before it caused a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019.",

The original dataset contained 14,380 records comprising RefSeq IDs for viral sequences and associated metadata. Some viruses are divided into discontiguous segments, which are represented as separate records in VHDB; in those cases the segments were treated as contigs of a single genome in further analysis. We removed records with unspecified host information and those confusing the highly pathogenic Variola virus with a similarly named genus of fish. Further, we filtered out viroids and satellites. Human-infecting viruses were extracted by searching for records containing \"Homo sapiens\" in the \"host name\" field. Note that VHDB contains information about multiple possible hosts for a given virus where appropriate. Any virus infecting humans was assigned to the positive class, also if other, non-human hosts exist. In total, the dataset contained 9,496 viruses, including 1,309 human viruses. We considered both DNA and RNA viruses; RNA sequences were encoded in the DNA alphabet, as in RefSeq."

Table 1 summarizes the prediction accuracy for different combinations of the training and test set composition. The models trained only on human and Chordata-infecting viruses maintain similar, or even better performance when evaluated on viruses infecting a much broader host range, including bacteria. This suggests that the learned decision boundary separates human viruses from all the others surprisingly well. We hypothesize that the human host signal must be relatively strong and contained within the Chordata host signal."

This holds also for novel viruses not present in the training set. In the paired read scenario, the previously described method fails, and standard, alignment-based homology testing algorithm cannot find any matches in more than 10% of the cases, resulting in relatively low accuracy. On a real human virome sample, where a main source of negative class reads is most likely contamination (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMoustafa_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rMoustafa_et+al_2017_a\">Moustafa et al, 2017</a>), our method filters out non-human viruses with high specificity. In this scenario, the BLAST-derived groundtruth labels were mined using the complete database (as opposed to just a training set). In all cases, our results are only as good as the training data used; high quality labels and sequences are needed to develop trustworthy models. Ideally, sources of error should be investigated with an in-depth analysis of a model\u2019s performance on multiple genomes covering a wide selection of taxonomic units. This is especially important as the method assumes no mechanistic link between an input sequence and the phenotype of interest, and the input sequence constitutes only a small fraction of the target genome without a wider biological context. Still, it is possible to predict a label even from those small, local fragments. A similar effect was also observed for image classification with CNNs (Brendel & Bethge, 2019)."

            "Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulencerelated genes in novel agents, as we show here for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, unknown before it caused a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019."

A selection of composition-based and alignment-based approaches has been presented in an extensive review by <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cEdwards_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rEdwards_et+al_2016_a\">Edwards et al (2016</a>). Prediction of eukariotic host tropism (including humans) based on known protein sequences was shown for the influenza A virus (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cEng_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rEng_et+al_2014_a\">Eng et al, 2014</a>).

While",
            "those approaches are limited to those particular species and do not scale to viral host-range prediction in general, the Host Taxon Predictor (HTP) (Ga\u0142an et al, 2019) uses logistic regression and support vector machines to predict if a novel virus infects bacteria, plants, vertebrates or arthropods. Yet, the authors argue that it is not possible to use HTP in a read-based manner; it requires long sequences of at least 3,000 nucleotides. This is incompatible with modern metagenomic next-generation sequencing workflows, where the DNA reads obtained are at least 10-20 times shorter.

It worked also with 150bp-long reads from real DNA sequencing runs, although in this case the reads originated also from the viruses present in the training set (and were therefore not \"novel\")."

We show that defining the negative (nonhuman) class is non-trivial and compare different ways of constructing the training set. Strikingly, a model trained to distinguish between viruses infecting humans and viruses infecting other chordates (a phylum of animals including vertebrates) generalizes well to evolutionarily distant nonhuman hosts, including even bacteria. This suggests that the host-related signal is strong and the learned decision boundary separates human viruses from other DNA sequences surprisingly well.",

The original dataset contained 14,380 records comprising RefSeq IDs for viral sequences and associated metadata. Some viruses are divided into discontiguous segments, which are represented as separate records in VHDB; in those cases the segments were treated as contigs of a single genome in further analysis. We removed records with unspecified host information and those confusing the highly pathogenic Variola virus with a similarly named genus of fish. Further, we filtered out viroids and satellites. Human-infecting viruses were extracted by searching for records containing \"Homo sapiens\" in the \"host name\" field. Note that VHDB contains information about multiple possible hosts for a given virus where appropriate. Any virus infecting humans was assigned to the positive class, also if other, non-human hosts exist. In total, the dataset contained 9,496 viruses, including 1,309 human viruses.

        "2.1.2. DEFINING THE NEGATIVE CLASS": [
            "While defining a human-infecting class is relatively straightforward, the reference negative class may be conceptualized in a variety of ways. The broadest definition takes all non-human viruses into account, including bacteriophages (bacterial viruses). This is especially important, as most of known bacteriophages are DNA viruses, while many important human (and animal) viruses are RNA viruses. One could expect that the multitude of available bacteriophage genomes dominating the negative class could lower the prediction performance on viruses similar to those infecting humans. This offers an open-view approach covering a wider part of the sequence space, but may lead to misclassification of potentially dangerous mammalian or avian viruses. As they are often involved in clinically relevant host-switching events, a stricter approach must also be considered. In this case, the negative class comprises only viruses infecting Chordata (a group containing vertebrates and closely related taxa). Two intermediate approaches consider all eukaryotic viruses (including plant and fungi viruses), or only animal-infecting viruses. This amounts to four nested host sets: \"All\" (8,187 non-human viruses), \"Eukaryota\" (5,114 viruses), \"Metazoa\" (2,942 viruses) and \"Chordata\" (2,078 viruses). Auxiliary sets containing only non-eukaryotic viruses (\"non-Eukaryota\"), non-animal eukaryotic viruses (\"non-Metazoa Eukaryota\") etc. can be easily constructed by set subtraction.",
            "For the positive class, we generated a training set containing 80% of the genomes, and validation and test sets with 10% of the genomes each. Importantly, the nested structure was kept also during the training-validation-test split: for example, the species assigned to the smallest test set (\"Chordata\") were also present in all the bigger test sets. The same applied to other taxonomic levels, as well as the training and validation sets wherever applicable."

First, we only generated the reads from the genomes of human-infecting viruses. Then, the same steps were applied to each of the four negative class sets. Finally, we also generated a fifth set, \"Stratified\", containing an equal number of reads drawn from genomes of the following disjunct host classes: \"Chordata\" (25%), \"nonChordata Metazoa\" (25%), \"non-Metazoa Eukaryota\" (25%) and \"non-Eukaryota\" (25%).",

Read number per genome was proportional to genome length, keeping the coverage uniform on average. While the original datasets are heavily imbalanced, we generated the same number of negative and positive data points (reads) regardless of the negative class definition used.",

We use dropout regularization in both cases, together with aggressive input dropout at the rate of 0.25 and 0.2 for the CNN and the LSTM, respectively. Input dropout may be interpreted as a special case of noise injection, where a fraction of input nucleotides is turned to N s. Representations of forward and reverse-complement strands are summed before the fully connected layers. As two mates in a read pair should originate from the same virus, predictions obtained for them can be averaged for a boost in performance.

Therefore, we prepared a modified version of the \"Stratified\" dataset, in which the last 100bp of each read were turned to zeros, mocking a shorter sequencing run while preserving the error model. Then, we retrained the CNN which had performed best on the original dataset.

We also tested the performance of using BLAST to search against an indexed database of labelled genomes. We constructed the database from the \"All\" training set and used discontiguous megablast to achieve high inter-species sensitivity.",

Although BLAST achieves the highest precision, it yields no predictions for over 10% of the samples. Averaging (AVG) the predictions of LSTMAll and CNNStr-150 reduces the variance (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cNaftaly_et+al_1997_a\" href=\"#rNaftaly_et+al_1997_a\">Naftaly et al, 1997</a>), maintaining high recall and precision, as well as improving accuracy.

Our models outperform their k-NN classifier. As the positive class massively outnumbers the negative class, all models achieve over 99% precision. We expected that the recall would have the strongest influence on the overall performance. Here, CNNStr-150 is the most sensitive. This is probably because the positive class is dominated by viruses which are not necessarily novel. The CNN was more accurate on training data, so we expected it to detect those viruses easily. Averaging the predictions lead to more balanced performance and the highest balanced accuracy."

Those \"counter-contributions\" may arise if a nucleotide with a negative weight forms a frequent motif with others with positive weights strong enough to activate the filter. We comment on this fact in the Section 4.2. Some filters seem to learn gapped motifs resembling a codon structure (Fig. 1d).

We scanned a genome of S. aureus with this filter and discovered that the learned motif is indeed significantly enriched in coding sequences (Fisher exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction, q < 10\u221215). It is also enriched in a number of specific genes. The one with the most hits (sraP, q < 10\u221215) is associated with virulence in endovascular infection."

This holds also for novel viruses not present in the training set. In the paired read scenario, the previously described method fails, and standard, alignment-based homology testing algorithm cannot find any matches in more than 10% of the cases, resulting in relatively low accuracy. On a real human virome sample, where a main source of negative class reads is most likely contamination (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMoustafa_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rMoustafa_et+al_2017_a\">Moustafa et al, 2017</a>), our method filters out non-human viruses with high specificity. In this scenario, the BLAST-derived groundtruth labels were mined using the complete database (as opposed to just a training set). In all cases, our results are only as good as the training data used; high quality labels and sequences are needed to develop trustworthy models. Ideally, sources of error should be investigated with an in-depth analysis of a model\u2019s performance on multiple genomes covering a wide selection of taxonomic units. This is especially important as the method assumes no mechanistic link between an input sequence and the phenotype of interest, and the input sequence constitutes only a small fraction of the target genome without a wider biological context. Still, it is possible to predict a label even from those small, local fragments. A similar effect was also observed for image classification with CNNs (Brendel & Bethge, 2019)."

It seems that the assumption of nucleotide independence \u2013 which is crucial for treating DeepLIFT as a method of estimating Shapley values for input nucleotides \u2013 is broken. Indeed, k-mer distribution profiles are frequently used features for modelling DNA sequences (as shown also by the dimershuffling method of generating reference sequences proposed by <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cShrikumar_et+al_2019_a\" href=\"#rShrikumar_et+al_2019_a\">Shrikumar et al (2019a</a>)).

On the other hand, once a trusted model is developed, it can be used on newly emerging pathogens, as the 2019-nCoV virus briefly analyzed in this work. The methods presented here may also be applied to other biological problems outside of the field of pathogen genomics. However, experimental work and traditional sequence analysis are required to truly understand the biology behind host adaptation and distinguish true hits from false positives."
