        "abstract": "Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are an emerging cause of infections, including chronic lymphadenitis in children. To identify risk factors for NTM lymphadenitis, particularly complicated disease, we collected epidemiologic, clinical, and microbiological data on 138 cases of NTM lymphadenitis in children across 13 centers in Germany and Austria. We assessed lifestyle factors but did not identify specific risk behaviors. We noted that more cases of NTM lymphadenitis occurred during cold months than during warm months. Moreover, we noted female sex and age <5.5 years as potential risk factors. Complete extirpation of the affected lymph node appeared to be the best therapeutic measure. We integrated the study data to develop a simple risk score to predict unfavorable clinical outcomes for NTM lymphadenitis.",

            "In conclusion, the NTM lymphadenitis risk profile for female patients <5 years of age, the chronic (albeit usually benign) course of disease, the worldwide predominance of M. avium, and the seasonal variability we noted in our study suggest a complex contribution of host, pathogen, environmental, and potential microbiome factors. Individual factors are insufficient to grasp the risk for unfavorable clinical outcomes. Our proposed risk score comprises multiple items and could be useful in estimating NTM lymphadenitis risk and stratifying patients to therapeutic modalities, if its validity is confirmed in a prospective study. Until then, early and complete extirpation of a suspicious lymph node remains a mainstay of NTM diagnosis and therapy."

            "In this study, we found that girls 18\u201336 months of age were at highest risk for NTM lymphadenitis, which aligns with findings of studies conducted in other geographic locations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. The underlying cause for the predominance of NTM in girls remains unclear. We speculate that exposure to soil-residing NTM could be associated with the increased risk for NTM infection. However, the amount of time girls spent outside did not correspond to disease risk. Moreover, the predominance of NTM in female patients in varying geographic and climatic regions suggests that differences in immunity or host\u2013pathogen interaction are more likely to be responsible for sexrelated differences in NTM lymphadenitis incidence, rather than differences in exposure to NTM.<br/><br/>We also found a seasonal incidence pattern that peaked during colder months. Other studies reported an increase in new cases during winter [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], but peak incidence in relation to temperature and length of daylight hours varied among studies in different geographic regions. To expand on other studies, we recorded the duration of symptoms at each patient\u2019s initial visit to participating centers. Using this information, we were able to correct for the time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis because differences in referral and availability of appointments might influence the seasonal pattern. We noticed that time from onset of symptoms to the first physical examination at a clinic varied greatly between centers. Year-round differences in NTM exposure also could affect disease incidence. For example, seasonal NTM occurrence in drinking water has been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]."

        "introduction": [
            "Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are an emerging cause of infections, including chronic lymphadenitis in children. To identify risk factors for NTM lymphadenitis, particularly complicated disease, we collected epidemiologic, clinical, and microbiological data on 138 cases of NTM lymphadenitis in children across 13 centers in Germany and Austria. We assessed lifestyle factors but did not identify specific risk behaviors. We noted that more cases of NTM lymphadenitis occurred during cold months than during warm months. Moreover, we noted female sex and age <5.5 years as potential risk factors. Complete extirpation of the affected lymph node appeared to be the best therapeutic measure. We integrated the study data to develop a simple risk score to predict unfavorable clinical outcomes for NTM lymphadenitis.",
            "Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are common in the environment. NTM frequently are found in soil and are the most common bacteria on showerhead surfaces [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Although many children likely have daily exposure to NTM, symptomatic infections are rare. Among children <2.5 years of age, the most frequently affected group, the annual NTM incidence in Germany has been estimated to be 3.1 cases/100,000 population [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. Some authors suggest the incidence of NTM infections in immunocompetent persons has been increasing in recent years [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], but little longitudinal data in well-defined epidemiologic contexts have been reported."

We documented the course of disease, including all diagnostic and therapeutic measures, antimicrobial drug therapy, associated clinical problems, prior medical history, vaccination status, and underlying conditions. Parents provided sociodemographic data, including ethnicity, place of birth, duration of breast-feeding, number of patient siblings, daycare attendance, cigarette smoke exposure, and parents\u2019 education and employment, as well as factors potentially increasing NTM exposure, such as animal contact, exposure to water and soil sources, and travel.

To minimize uncertainty in reporting the duration of symptoms, we analyzed the subgroup of patients with the shortest reported duration of symptoms, <4 weeks. The seasonal pattern remained the same, but statistical significance was lost due to the smaller sample size. In addition, peak incidence differed depending on patients\u2019 ages.

Of note, 21% of cases had >1 affected region, such as same-sided cervical and submandibular lymph nodes; 9% of cases had bilateral involvement, mainly occurring as cervical and nuchal localization. We also noted additional local symptoms, such as discoloration, in 59% of cases. Only 17% of cases reported systemic symptoms; most were unspecific, and fever was reported most frequently.",

Only 23% of patients with complete extirpation of the affected lymph node received appropriate antimycobacterial therapy, compared with 49% undergoing other types of surgery (p = 0.006). The percentage of patients receiving antimycobacterial therapy declined over the course of the study (data not shown).",
            "Diagnosis and Treatment During the initial workup, most (97%) patients had an ultrasound; 32% had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but MRI use was highly variable between centers (range 11%\u201378%; p<0.001); and 59% (43%\u201380%; p = 0.005) of patients had a chest radiograph. Tuberculin skin testing was done in 65% (49%\u2013100%; p<0.001) of cases, and 61% of tests were positive. Most (94%) patients received surgical treatment; 49% (32%\u201369%; p = 0.03) had complete extirpation of the affected lymph node, and 40% had >1 operation, mainly due to impaired wound healing (Table 2).

In addition to single factors, we created a surrogate, \u201cunfavorable outcome,\u201d which we defined as illness lasting >12 months, >1 surgical intervention at the same site, or occurrence of major complications, such as substantial scarring or facial nerve palsy.

            "The factor most strongly associated with unfavorable outcome was the presence of liquefaction in the affected lymph node identified by ultrasound or MRI. Most (73%) patients with liquefaction had an unfavorable outcome, compared with only 40% of patients who did not (p = 0.009).",
            "Surgical procedures also affected outcomes. Overall, 51% of patients who had complete primary extirpation had an unfavorable outcome, compared with 75% of patients who had other types of surgery (p = 0.028). Only 19% of patients who had primary extirpation had impaired wound healing, compared with 35% of patients who had other types of surgery (p = 0.049). Complete extirpation also was associated with a lower incidence of other complications; only 3% of these patients had facial nerve palsy compared with 12% who had other surgical procedures (Table 3). Of patients who had the affected lymph node drained, 60% experienced impaired wound healing and an unfavorable outcome (p = 0.024), compared with 25% of patients who received other therapies (p = 0.027).",
            "Mycobacteria-targeted antimicrobial therapy was not associated with improved clinical outcomes. When we used multivariate analysis to correct for the influence of the treatment center, complete extirpation of the affected lymph node still predicted a favorable clinical outcome (p = 0.029), good primary wound healing after surgery (p = 0.026), and a low rate of postsurgical complications, such as facial nerve palsy (p = 0.01). We saw impaired wound healing more often in connection with local skin symptoms, such as discoloration (p = 0.027), increased size of the affected lymph node (p = 0.036), and >1 affected location (p = 0.039). Taken together, complete extirpation was associated with an overall favorable clinical outcome and a lower rate of local complications compared with other types of surgical intervention.",
            "Using these results, we developed a score for estimating the risk for an unfavorable clinical course before surgery. We grouped factors associated with adverse outcomes. Because the sample size was small, we could not calculate effect sizes reliably. Instead, we assigned each of the following items 1 point: skin discoloration, lymph node >2 cm, liquefaction on ultrasound or MRI, and >1 affected location. The resulting score helped us demonstrate a statistically significant association between outcomes and local complications, such as impaired wound healing, which has a Pearson score of r = 0.23 (p = 0.036) (Figure 4).",
            "Risk Factors for NTM Lymphadenitis To identify candidate risk factors for NTM lymphadenitis, we recruited control patients matched for age, sex, and center. In addition, we selected an age- and sex-matched control cohort from the KiGGS 2003\u2013 2006 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. We compared sociodemographic factors, Table 3. Histologic characteristics of lymph nodes from children infected with nontuberculous mycobacteria across 13 centers in",
            "medical history, and data relating to potential exposure to mycobacteria, such as contact with animals and water sources, between patients and controls. Sociodemographic characteristics, such as parents\u2019 level of education, a child\u2019s presence in daycare, household smoking, and number of siblings, did not differ between patients and controls. We saw no difference in height and weight, the rate or duration of breastfeeding (mean 5.7 months for NTM patients and 5.5 months for control cohort; p = 0.590), or adherence to recommended vitamin D supplementation in the first year of life (94% for NTM patients and 81% for control cohort; p = 0.151).",
            "We detected no difference between groups in health-related factors, such as frequency of antimicrobial drug treatment, typical childhood infections, or allergies. We also did not detect any difference in factors related to possible exposure to NTM, such as number of hours playing outside per day, exposure to natural bodies of water or swimming pools, or contact with pets and farm animals."
        ],
        "Discussion": [
            "In this study, we found that girls 18\u201336 months of age were at highest risk for NTM lymphadenitis, which aligns with findings of studies conducted in other geographic locations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. The underlying cause for the predominance of NTM in girls remains unclear. We speculate that exposure to soil-residing NTM could be associated with the increased risk for NTM infection. However, the amount of time girls spent outside did not correspond to disease risk. Moreover, the predominance of NTM in female patients in varying geographic and climatic regions suggests that differences in immunity or host\u2013pathogen interaction are more likely to be responsible for sexrelated differences in NTM lymphadenitis incidence, rather than differences in exposure to NTM.",
            "We also found a seasonal incidence pattern that peaked during colder months. Other studies reported an increase in new cases during winter [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>], but peak incidence in relation to temperature and length of daylight hours varied among studies in different geographic regions. To expand on other studies, we recorded the duration of symptoms at each patient\u2019s initial visit to participating centers. Using this information, we were able to correct for the time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis because differences in referral and availability of appointments might influence the seasonal pattern. We noticed that time from onset of symptoms to the first physical examination at a clinic varied greatly between centers. Year-round differences in NTM exposure also could affect disease incidence. For example, seasonal NTM occurrence in drinking water has been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>].",
            "Furthermore, the low incidence of NTM infections in warmer months could be linked to seasonal variations in vitamin D levels. Variations in vitamin D metabolism previously have been linked to NTM susceptibility [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. However, in our study, patients and healthy controls did not differ in sunlight exposure, and vitamin D supplementation in the first year of life occurred more often in the NTM-infected cohort than in controls.",
            "Given the slow replication of NTM, incubation time for NTM lymphadenitis is unknown. Thus, a critical timeframe for infection is difficult to establish from the seasonal pattern seen in our cohort. In addition, unknown host factors, such as concurring infections, might affect seasonal incidence.",
            "M. avium causes the majority of NTM lymphadenitis cases in countries as far removed from each other as Germany, Sweden, and Australia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. By contrast, NTM species isolated in pulmonary infections have much more pronounced regional differences [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Other than M. avium, we noted variations in NTM species between centers, but the small number of cases precluded a more detailed analysis. Nevertheless, the relatively high number of rare species underlines the need for improved PCR and culture techniques for reliable diagnosis of uncommon NTM species.",
            "Therapeutic procedures, disease outcomes, and complications varied substantially among centers and over the course of the study. Overall, patients frequently had complicated clinical courses that lasted >12 months or major complications, even after complete extirpation, the treatment most associated with a favorable outcome. More than 75% of patients in the 3 most experienced study centers had complicated clinical courses, which is a striking contrast to a report by Lindeboom et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] in which early complete lymph node extirpation cured >90% of lymphadenitis cases. However, lymphadenitis frequently is caused by factors other than NTM. Our data might reflect more on clinical practices in which early extirpation is more the exception than the rule, a hypothesis further supported by the fact that clinical outcomes did not correlate with center size in our study. Consequently, surgical experience might not explain the unfavorable outcomes in our study. However, because only specialized centers participated in the study and inclusion criteria were strict, complicated surgical cases probably were overrepresented in our cohort. This finding is supported by evidence that some patients underwent primary surgery elsewhere and were referred to our participating centers after they received a definitive NTM diagnosis.",
            "The rate of facial nerve palsy in our study was within the range reported elsewhere [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>], but we saw variations among centers. Because our study relied on local clinical data, we cannot rule out differences in sensitivity thresholds. However, differences in the surgical approach reflected by the varying rates of complete extirpation most likely explain this observation. Primary complete lymph node extirpation was associated with a lower rate of facial nerve palsy than other surgical procedures. However, this observation could have a high bias because complete extirpation is performed more frequently when the affected lymph node is farther from the facial nerve. Antimicrobial therapy for NTM lymphadenitis decreased over the course of the study, which might reflect the increasing number of studies questioning the therapeutic benefit of antimicrobial drugs to treat NTM lymphadenitis.",
            "Our study has several limitations. First, the limited number of disease controls precluded a more detailed analysis of possible individual risk factors. Second, our cohort probably does not reflect the full variety of NTM lymphadenitis phenotypes. Our strict inclusion criteria and registry-like design likely overrepresented severe cases, which are seen more frequently in secondary and tertiary health centers, and underrepresented less severe cases. Third, because we relied on data acquired by local centers and did not collect detailed information on PCR methods, we cannot rule out differences in laboratory methods or interpretation of clinical findings.",
            "In conclusion, the NTM lymphadenitis risk profile for female patients <5 years of age, the chronic (albeit usually benign) course of disease, the worldwide predominance of M. avium, and the seasonal variability we noted in our study suggest a complex contribution of host, pathogen, environmental, and potential microbiome factors. Individual factors are insufficient to grasp the risk for unfavorable clinical outcomes. Our proposed risk score comprises multiple items and could be useful in estimating NTM lymphadenitis risk and stratifying patients to therapeutic modalities, if its validity is confirmed in a prospective study. Until then, early and complete extirpation of a suspicious lymph node remains a mainstay of NTM diagnosis and therapy."
