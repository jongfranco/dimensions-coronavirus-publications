            "We sought to systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis by assessing the prevalence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections from a number of studies conducted in Iran. Methods: Entire studies addressing epidemiology of hMPV in Iran using data from PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of science, Google Scholar, Embase, and national Persian databases up to June 2019 were included. Results: The estimated prevalence of hMPV was 8.9% (95% CI 5.4\u201314.2) in different regions in Iran. Compared to the global rate, in Iran hMPV infection presented an intermediate prevalence rate. The majority of hMPV positive patients were pediatric populations with pooled prevalence of 7.6% (I2 = 95%, 95% CI 3.5\u201315.6). Conclusion: This first comprehensive review covering researches over the last 11 years expanded our knowledge about hMPV circulating in Iran. Future large epidemiological studies are needed for the evaluation of hMPV prevalence and genotype distribution in different unanalyzed regions in Iran."
