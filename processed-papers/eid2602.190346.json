        "abstract": "Coronaviruses cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in diverse host species. Deltacoronaviruses (DCoVs) have been identified in various songbird species and in leopard cats in China. In 2009, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was detected in fecal samples from pigs in Asia, but its etiologic role was not identified until 2014, when it caused major diarrhea outbreaks in swine in the United States. Studies have shown that PDCoV uses a conserved region of the aminopeptidase N protein to infect cell lines derived from multiple species, including humans, pigs, and chickens. Because PDCoV is a potential zoonotic pathogen, investigations of its prevalence in humans and its contribution to human disease continue. We report experimental PDCoV infection and subsequent transmission among poultry. In PDCoV-inoculated chicks and turkey poults, we observed diarrhea, persistent viral RNA titers from cloacal and tracheal samples, PDCoVspecific serum IgY antibody responses, and antigen-positive cells from intestines.",

APN is a protein that exhibits enzymatic activity, peptide processing, cholesterol uptake, and chemotaxis to cell signaling and cell adhesion [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. APN is widely distributed and highly conserved in amino acid sequences across species of the Animalia kingdom [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including epithelial cells of the kidneys [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], respiratory tract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>], and gastrointestinal tract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>].<br/><br/>Our data suggest that chicks and poults are susceptible to infection with PDCoV. In addition, the rapid transmission of PDCoV to the sentinel birds that comingled with infected birds demonstrates that the virus could spread easily. The length of our pilot study did not allow us to determine how long the chicks and poults would be affected by PDCoV or how long they might shed viral RNA. The chicks appeared to recover more rapidly than poults; clinical signs diminished or were completely absent by 14 dpi. However, chicks still were shedding low viral RNA titers at 14 dpi. Poults did not recover by the end of the study and still exhibited gross pathology and mild to moderate diarrhea. PDCoV RNA shedding titers were higher in poults than in the chicks. Cloacal shedding titers in chicks peaked at 9 dpi and then decreased. In poults, cloacal viral RNA shedding titers were multiphasic, peaking at 2 dpi, with additional smaller peaks at 9 and 14 dpi. The rapid onset of viral RNA shedding correlates with previous in vitro data in which the PDCoV S1 domain bound most efficiently to APN of galline origin [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and cytopathic effects were observed more rapidly in leghorn male hepatoma and DF1 chicken cell lines compared with swine testicular cells (S.P.

            "Coronaviruses cause respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in diverse host species. Deltacoronaviruses (DCoVs) have been identified in various songbird species and in leopard cats in China. In 2009, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was detected in fecal samples from pigs in Asia, but its etiologic role was not identified until 2014, when it caused major diarrhea outbreaks in swine in the United States. Studies have shown that PDCoV uses a conserved region of the aminopeptidase N protein to infect cell lines derived from multiple species, including humans, pigs, and chickens. Because PDCoV is a potential zoonotic pathogen, investigations of its prevalence in humans and its contribution to human disease continue. We report experimental PDCoV infection and subsequent transmission among poultry. In PDCoV-inoculated chicks and turkey poults, we observed diarrhea, persistent viral RNA titers from cloacal and tracheal samples, PDCoVspecific serum IgY antibody responses, and antigen-positive cells from intestines.",

APN is widely distributed and highly conserved in amino acid sequences across species of the Animalia kingdom [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including epithelial cells of the kidneys [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>], respiratory tract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>], and gastrointestinal tract [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>].",
            "Our data suggest that chicks and poults are susceptible to infection with PDCoV. In addition, the rapid transmission of PDCoV to the sentinel birds that comingled with infected birds demonstrates that the virus could spread easily. The length of our pilot study did not allow us to determine how long the chicks and poults would be affected by PDCoV or how long they might shed viral RNA. The chicks appeared to recover more rapidly than poults; clinical signs diminished or were completely absent by 14 dpi. However, chicks still were shedding low viral RNA titers at 14 dpi. Poults did not recover by the end of the study and still exhibited gross pathology and mild to moderate diarrhea. PDCoV RNA shedding titers were higher in poults than in the chicks. Cloacal shedding titers in chicks peaked at 9 dpi and then decreased. In poults, cloacal viral RNA shedding titers were multiphasic, peaking at 2 dpi, with additional smaller peaks at 9 and 14 dpi. The rapid onset of viral RNA shedding correlates with previous in vitro data in which the PDCoV S1 domain bound most efficiently to APN of galline origin [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and cytopathic effects were observed more rapidly in leghorn male hepatoma and DF1 chicken cell lines compared with swine testicular cells (S.P. Kenney, unpub. data).",
            "ELISA results showed that both chicks and poults developed PDCoV antibodies by 14 dpi. Pig infection dynamics have demonstrated a similar serum",
            "neutralizing antibody titer increase at 7\u201314 days [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>]. Sentinel birds had low or undetectable antibody responses compared with experimentally challenged birds, likely because of the passive infection method and because less time passed between exposure to the virus and the end of the study.",
            "Recent studies demonstrated that PDCoV can infect and kill cells of other species through APN receptors [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. PDCoV has been reported to infect commercial chickens in vivo [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. The differences in susceptibility to PDCoV infection between chicks and poults we observed could be related to differences in APN expression levels between the species.",
            "The true incidence rates for PDCoV infection, natural host range, reservoirs, and routes of transmission are still relatively unknown, and no plans for vaccine development have been reported [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. DCoV RNA has been detected in fecal samples from wild birds [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>], Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata), and leopard cats [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. In addition to swine, calves have been shown by experimental testing to be susceptible to PDCoV infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. These data, coupled with the",
            "PDCoV binding receptor APN being conserved across many species, suggest that the host range for PDCoV is broader than initially expected [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>]. The close sequence homology between DCoV isolates from mammalian and wild bird species implies a transmission cycle in which PDCoV regularly crosses from wild birds and mammals into animal production systems, including the swine and poultry industries. More epidemiologic data are required to understand the full extent to which DCoVs are threatening food production systems and whether they pose a direct threat to human health.",
            "Our results are consistent with the likelihood that avian species act as potential passthrough or intermediate hosts for PDCoV. In vivo confirmation of avian susceptibility to PDCoV suggests that in vitro data implicating human susceptibility should be evaluated further. Research regarding how PDCoV is adapting and mutating in different species and whether it infects humans is critical to determining if PDCoV poses a pandemic health risk to commercial poultry or humans."
