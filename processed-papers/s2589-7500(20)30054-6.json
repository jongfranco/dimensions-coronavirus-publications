            "As Executive Director of the Communicable Diseases Cluster, WHO, David Heymann led the international response to SARS. He explains that AI or no AI, several key factors are required for a successful public health response to an outbreak of a new infection. These factors include understanding of transmissibility and risk populations; establishing the natural history of infection, including incubation period and mortality rate; identifying and characterising the causative organism; and, in some instances, epidemiological modelling to suggest effective prevention and control measures. This information can be collected from those working at outbreak sites virtually linked with WHO. This strategy worked for SARS and is, again, a major source of information for COVID-19, he stresses.",
            "Collectively these data can be used to train and prime the AI application for its dedicated task. \u201cWe can\u2019t replace the human brain at this point, nor the epidemiologist or virologist with anything that can analyse and rapidly do what is necessary at the onset of an outbreak. We still need to prime that AI with information from study of the evidence and link this to events in the outbreak,\u201d Heymann highlights."

But it is dependent on where, in China, the outbreak is focussed because the number of flights to parts of Africa varies by Chinese city,\u201d Kraemer points out.",
            "\u201cIn most AI applications, we consider the question and ask what are the best data available to answer it?\u201d Kraemer says. One of the multiple data streams relevant to pathogens spread is accurate case reporting for COVID-19. Kraemer receives news reports and twice daily government reports that provide datasets on how many cases exist in any one specific location (eg, in Wuhan city). \u201cThis is a baseline for us.. Before Chinese New Year we looked at how many people left Wuhan over a day, and this information comes from search engines including Baidu. WeChat, a messaging, social media and mobile payment app, provides data on travel around Wuhan,\u201d he explains. \u201cMachine learning models use these data to predict the most likely location of where novel coronavirus might arrive next and this might inform where and how to run border checks.\u201d A study by Kaiyuan Sun and colleagues published today in The Lancet Digital Health testifies to the strength of monitoring news reports and social media to help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and to provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency.",
            "Not only is China central to the outbreak, but the country is also playing a large role in using AI to help manage the COVID-19 outbreak. Infervision, a Beijing-based AI company uses its algorithm to spot COVID-19 on images of the lung as distinct from other respiratory infections.",
            "Velislava Petrova is a virologist (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK), who is currently working at UNAIDS, Geneva, on the latest and most effective AI applications. \u201cWe are trying to find a more sustainable way to control the impact of the novel coronavirus rather than having to shut down borders, businesses and similar,\u201d she says.",
            "Petrova highlights that Infervision\u2019s AI application minimises the burden of these processes by expediting the diagnoses and monitoring of COVID-19. \u201cAs more and more scans are done then the algorithm learns and improves accuracy together with the virus.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe value of AI comes into play by reducing the burden on clinicians in a scenario such as the current COVID-19 outbreak,\u201d Petrova explains.",
            "Reflecting on a rapidly growing concern in the current outbreak that regards the infection of health-care professionals, Kuan Chen, founder of Infervision, points out that the Infervision AI application can help protect staff. The death of medical doctor, Li Wenliang, on Feb 7, 2020, who was reprimanded by Chinese authorities for warning about the virus, highlights the plight of clinicians on the frontline.",
            "\u201cAn article in JAMA states that human-to-human hospital-associated transmission accounted for 41% of all cases in a study of patients at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University,\u201d Chen notes. \u201cWe also know that more than 1000 hospital staff in the city of Wuhan have been confirmed infected.\u201d",
            "This is where Infervision\u2019s AI application could help. From a lung CT scan, the AI is designed to quickly detect lesions of possible coronavirus pneumonia, to measure its volume, shape, and density, and to compare changes of multiple lung lesions from the image, which all provide a quantitative report to assist doctors making fast judgement. \u201cWhile a manual read of a CT scan can take up to 15 minutes, AI can finish reading the image in 10 seconds.\u201d Application of this technology in COVID-19 has not yet been published in a peerreviewed journal.",
            "Chen adds that in Wuhan, where there are far too many cases to test and PCR-based diagnosis takes too long (sometimes over a week), CT imaging with AI could serve as a surrogate for doctors when fast judgement is needed. \u201cDoctors no longer need to engage in the lengthy process of manually reading images one by one to identify high risk cases, while coronavirus-probable patients wait around the hospital posing a severe risk of infecting other patients and hospital staff.\u201d",
            "It is still too early to tell if\u2014and to what extent\u2014AI will have an impact on the COVID-19 outbreak. The numbers of confirmed cases and deaths rise daily and so too does the supply of data. One thing is certain, \u201cAI is relevant to this outbreak and in the future it will become even more so,\u201d says Moritz. Heymann is more conservative and remarks that, \u201cAI is one part of the final understanding\u201d. Time will tell."
