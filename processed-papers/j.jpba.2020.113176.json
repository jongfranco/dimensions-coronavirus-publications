The total flavonoids of Sophora tonkinensis (TFST) were inactive on the complement system but showed obvious anticomplement activity after incubated with human intestinal bacteria in vitro. In order to discover the metabolic activation of TFST by intestinal flora, the constituents of TFST and its metabolites were identified by UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS. Their anticomplement activities were evaluated through the classical and alternative pathway. As a result, eighteen flavonoids were identified, including seven flavonoid glycosides, five aglycones and six isoprenylated flavonoids. All the glycosides (daidzein-4\u2032-glucoside-rhamnoside, sophorabioside, rutin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, ononin, trifolirhizin) were metabolized into their corresponding aglycones in different extent by human intestinal bacteria, resulting in the contents of the five aglycones were highly increased in 24 h. However, no changes have occurred on the six isoprenylated flavonoids. Interestingly, three aglycones (quercetin, formononetin and maackiain) had significantly more potent anticomplement activities than their prototype glycosides. The results indicated that the enhancement of TFST anticomplement activity was attributed to the active aglycones, especially formononetin and quercetin, produced by human intestinal bacteria. These aglycones are likely to be among the potential active components of S. tonkinensis for its inhibiting inflammation effects.",
