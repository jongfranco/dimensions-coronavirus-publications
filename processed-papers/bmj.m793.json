            "Trump defended his 80% cut to the pandemic response team and in answer to critics he said that the team \u201chadn\u2019t been used for years. We could bring them in tomorrow. We could build up quickly.\u201d"

        "Medical bills": [
            "The medical bills of patients who do not have health insurance, are uninsured, or are undocumented immigrants was highlighted by a Florida man. Recently returned from a business trip to China he went to an emergency department in Miami with flu like symptoms. After testing, he was found not to have covid-19 but faced a $3270 bill from his insurance company because he had a limited or \u201cjunk\u201d insurance plan.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]",

American public health is decentralised. It\u2019s up to the cities and states. Some states which have accepted Medicaid (health insurance for poorer people) expansion could use funds to provide care to the uninsured and undocumented.\u201d",
            "The large state of Texas, for example, did not accept Medicaid expansion. Quarantine policies, she said, differ widely from state to state and haven\u2019t been updated in 50 years.",
