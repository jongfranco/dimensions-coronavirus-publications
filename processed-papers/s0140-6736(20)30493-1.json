            "Since the first case of SARS-CoV-2 local transmission was confirmed, the EMS in the Lombardy region (reached by dialling 112, the European emergency number) represented the first response to handling suspected symptomatic patients, to adopting containment measures, and to addressing popula\u00ad tion concerns. The EMS of the metro\u00ad politan area of Milan instituted a COVID-19 Response Team of dedicated and highly qualified personnel, with the ultimate goal of tackling the viral outbreak without burdening ordinary EMS activity (figure). The team is active at all times and consists of ten health-care professionals supported by two technicians.",
            "The COVID-19 Response Team collaborated with regional medical authorities to design a procedural algo\u00ad rithm for the detection of suspected cases of COVID-19 (figure). Patients were screened for: (1) domicile or prolonged stay in the hot zone (ie, where COVID-19 cases first appeared), or both; (2) close contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19; and (3) close contact with patients with respiratory symptoms from the hot zone or China. The COVID-19 Response Team assessed the clinical condition of screened individuals to determine the need for hospital admission or for home testing for SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent isolation. Finally, recommendations to limit viral spread were provided to the other family members, especially when isolation was indicated.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]",
            "The COVID-19 Response Team handles patient flow to local hospitals and addresses specific issues about bed resources, emergency department overcrowding, and the need for patient transfer to other specialised facilities. The algorithm is constantly updated to meet regional directives about hot zone extension and modalities for SARS-CoV-2 testing.",
