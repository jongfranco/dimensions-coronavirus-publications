Scavenger receptor A (SRA) is a phagocytic pattern recognition receptor involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, recognition, and clearance of pathogens or modified self\u2010molecules. Emerging evidence pointed out that SRA might act as an immunomodulator that contributes to innate immune defense against invading pathogens. Herein, we examined the role of SRA in the initiation of type I interferon (IFN) response to HBV infection and the virus clearance. Our results showed that SRA\u2010deficient (SRA\u2212/\u2212) mice were resistant to HBV infection developed by hydrodynamic injection of HBV replicon plasmid. We found lower levels of HBV DNA and viral protein expression in SRA\u2212/\u2212 mice, which was associated with enhanced type I IFN production, compared with wild\u2010type controls. Besides, we performed gain and loss of function experiments and determined that SRA inhibits innate antiviral immune responses to HBV. SRA could interact directly with tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2010associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and inhibit its K63\u2010linked ubiquitination. Moreover, we provided evidence that SRA negatively regulates the stability of TRAF3 protein by promoting the recruitment of OTUB1 to TRAF3. Our findings indicate that SRA plays a crucial role in innate immune signaling by targeting TRAF3 for degradation and balancing the innate antiviral immunity.",
