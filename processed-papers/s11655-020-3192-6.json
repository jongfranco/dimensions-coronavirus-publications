        "abstract": "Objective: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. Methods: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. Results: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24\u20130.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). Conclusions: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.

It is urgent and reasonable to explore effective intervention strategies from traditional    \u2022 6 \u2022<br/><br/>medicine for its prevention. This study examines the historical records for infection prevention in CM, as well as previous clinical evidence on CM prevention for similar public health emergencies such as SARS and H1N1 influenza. Recorded literature showed that the use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases can be traced back to ancient CM practice over thousands of years, and its successful effects were preliminarily substantiated by modern human clinical researches when applied to SARS and H1N1 influenza epidemics suggesting that historical CM experience is a worthwhile approach.<br/><br/>Based on the comprehensive analyses of the prevention programs issued by 23 provinces since the COVID-19 outbreak, we found that the main CM principles in preventing COVID-19 were to tonify qi to protect and provide defense from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness with aroma. It was also similar to the characteristics of CHM formulae for preventing \"pestilence\" in ancient times and SARS in 2003.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] The 6 most commonly used herbs were Astragali Radix (Huangqi), Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma (Gancao), Saposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Forsythiae Fructus (Lianqiao). Astragali Radix (Huangqi), Saposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng), and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Baizhu) are all ingredients of a classical herbal formula Yupingfeng Powder, for tonifying qi to protect from external pathogens. In Lao, et al's controlled study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] of CM formula for preventing SARS, Yupingfeng Powder was also the main ingredients.

            "Objective: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. Methods: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. Results: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24\u20130.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). Conclusions: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.

            "Of the 31 provinces (including autonomous regions, and municipalities) in Chinese mainland, health authorities in 23 provinces had officially issued programs recommending herbal formulae to preventing COVID-19. These 23 provinces cover 7 regions of mainland: Northeast, North, Central (including Wuhan, Hubei Province, the original outbreak of COVID-19), South, East, Northwest, and Southwest China. All programs were formulated by clinical experts organized by local health authorities according to local geographic and climate characteristics and COVID-19 prevalent conditions. The earliest program recommending CM for prevention was issued by Sichuan Province on January 21, 2019. Ten provinces have updated their programs since the first announcement, 7 of them have issued the 2nd edition and 3 issued the third edition. The applicable population of preventive programs included general and special population (such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, patients with chronic comorbidity diseases). Different groups of populations had specified preventive CM formulae. The programs issued by the 23 provinces included CM formulae ranging from 1 up to 10, with an average of 3.4 per program. With regard to the course of CM formulae for prevention, 11 provinces recommended from 3 to 14 days, while 12 provinces did not mention. In addition, Tibet Autonomous Region recommended Tibetan medicine and Guizhou province recommended Miao medicine formulae (one of the minority folk medicines). The basic characteristics of 23 provincial programs are shown in Appendix 1.",

        "DISCUSSION": [
            "As a new emerging acute respiratory infectious disease, COVID-19 lacks effective methods to control and treat the infection. It is urgent and reasonable to explore effective intervention strategies from traditional",
            "medicine for its prevention. This study examines the historical records for infection prevention in CM, as well as previous clinical evidence on CM prevention for similar public health emergencies such as SARS and H1N1 influenza. Recorded literature showed that the use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases can be traced back to ancient CM practice over thousands of years, and its successful effects were preliminarily substantiated by modern human clinical researches when applied to SARS and H1N1 influenza epidemics suggesting that historical CM experience is a worthwhile approach.",
            "Based on the comprehensive analyses of the prevention programs issued by 23 provinces since the COVID-19 outbreak, we found that the main CM principles in preventing COVID-19 were to tonify qi to protect and provide defense from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness with aroma. It was also similar to the characteristics of CHM formulae for preventing \"pestilence\" in ancient times and SARS in 2003.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] The 6 most commonly used herbs were Astragali Radix (Huangqi), Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma (Gancao), Saposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Forsythiae Fructus (Lianqiao). Astragali Radix (Huangqi), Saposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng), and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Baizhu) are all ingredients of a classical herbal formula Yupingfeng Powder, for tonifying qi to protect from external pathogens. In Lao, et al's controlled study[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] of CM formula for preventing SARS, Yupingfeng Powder was also the main ingredients. Some studies have confirmed that Yupingfeng Powder has antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>] Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua) and Forsythiae Fructus (Lianqiao) are the core components of Yinqiao Powder, which is a classical formula used to prevent and treat respiratory infectious diseases in ancient.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] An experimental study found that the effect of Yinqiao Powder (\u94f6\u7fd8 \u6563) in preventing and treating upper respiratory tract infection could be explained by its antibacterial and antiviral properties and improvement of the function of upper respiratory mucosal immune system.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] A multicenter, large-scale, randomized trial found that Yinqiao Powder plus another heat-clearing formula could reduce time to fever resolution in patients with the H1N1 influenza virus infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]",
            "At present, the National Health Commission of China has not issued a CM prevention program for COVID-19. The reasons may be, first, according to the CM theory of three-factors concerned treatment (Sanyin Zhiyi, \u4e09\u56e0\u5236\u5b9c), due to the differences of individual, regional, and seasonal factors in the occurrence and distribution of diseases, these factors should be considered in prevention and treatment,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a>] and second, lack of solid evidence of CM formula for COVID-19. By comparing and analyzing the prevention programs issued by provincial levels, we also found that there was slight regional difference in the recommended herbal formulae and prescription principles. For example, due to the dry climate in northern China, there are additional one or two herbs for nourishing yin in the formula, like Glehniae Radix (Shashen) and Ophiopogonis Radix (Maidong), while in the south, due to the humid climate, aromatic herbs with the function of resolving dampness and turbidity are used in the formulae, like Pogostemonis Herba (Huoxiang) and Eupatorii Herba (Peilan).",
            "Individual difference was also considered in the prevention programs in some provinces. There were two or more formulae recommended in 18 provinces' programs, which were applicable for different populations, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, or patients with chronic comorbidity diseases, population in close contact with COVID-19 patients, etc. In addition, 7 provinces or provincelevel municipality (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Henan, Hunan, Shandong, Yunnan) recommended formulae according to the types of CM body constitutions of the population. This tailored prevention strategy might help to improve the preventive effect.",
            "We suggest that the safety should also be paid attention to when taking CHM formula to prevent COVID-19, especially when they are used for long period. The public should choose the prescriptions under the guidance of CM doctors according to the program issued by provincial health authorities, and avoid taking the prescriptions or herbs with unknown origin and without officially approval. It should also be noted that the prevention advice for taking decoction were not reported in the 12 provinces' program. According to the programs of other provinces, it is appropriate to take the decoction for 1 week.",
            "and balance of risks and benefits, we do not recommend that all people should take CHM to prevent COVID-19. Due to the highly contagion,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>] high-risk populations exposed to COVID-19 patients, including medical personnel, family members, and other people who are in close contact with COVID-19 patients, as well as residents living in COVID-19 outbreak areas, would probably benefit from taking CHM formulae for prevention. These formulae recommended in the prevention programs are easily available in pharmacies and hospitals across the country.",
            "There are some limitations within this study. Firstly, historical records of using CM for \"pestilence\" prevention were examined in the review, however, the term \"pestilence\" might be a broad concept in ancient CM books, including infectious diseases transmitted through respiratory tract, digestive tract and other ways, so it might not be completely representative of the respiratory viral diseases especially the COVID-19. Secondly, as there is no direct clinical evidence for the prevention of the new emerging COVID-19, currently reported researches were from previous literature on the prevention of SARS and H1N1 influenza by CM which can only be considered as indirect evidence to refer to the current outbreak. Thirdly, the prevention programs for preventing COVID-19 were issued shortly after the outbreak, which were formulated by CM experts based on their previous experience in the prevention and treatment of similar diseases and their initial understanding of the disease; therefore, the actual effect of these programs needs to be verified in clinical application, and updated and improved according to the evidence of new researches on COVID-19.",
            "For future studies, we recommend prospective cohort studies, RCTs or registry studies to evaluate the effect of CHM formulae in prevention of COVID-19. At present, as the COVID-19 has not yet been controlled, we expect that a series of prospective population studies with rigorous design and large sample should commence with protocol registration, ethical approval, and implementation in a timely manner, to produce reliable evidence for CM prevention of COVID-19 or similar emerging respiratory infectious diseases in the future.",
            "In conclusion, based on historical records and clinical evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, CHM formula could be an alternative approach for the prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population while waiting for the development of a successful vaccine. Prospective well design population studies are needed to evaluate the preventive effect of CM."
