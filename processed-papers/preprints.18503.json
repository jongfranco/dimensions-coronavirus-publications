Countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) have high vulnerability and variable capacity to respond to outbreaks. Many of these countries addressed the need for increasing capacity in the areas of surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing, and follow-up of potential contacts, strict health facility infection prevention and control, and other public health control interventions. Moreover, countries addressed the need for communication strategies that direct general and vulnerable populations to actions for self-protection and as well protection to communities and close contacts. \nThis paper aims to highlight the role and continuous efforts of the Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) and the EMR\u2019s Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETPs) to build the capacities in the countries in the EMR to respond to the current COVID-19 threat. \nGHD/EMPHNET is escalating efforts and activities to support countries in the EMR in preparedness and response to COVID-19 outbreak, through its FETP graduates and residents. EMPHNET has the scientific expertise to contribute to elevating the level of country alert and preparedness in the EMR and to provide technical support through promotional material (leaflets and brochures), workshops on contact tracing, dissemination of guidelines, the regular sharing of technical updates, developing teaching case-studies to educate public health professionals on COVID-19, and rapid response team training. The FETPs in the EMR have implemented and are currently working on many activities to strengthen the countries\u2019 preparedness against COVID-19. The FETPs are currently actively participating in surveillance and screening at airports and other ports of entry, development of communication materials and guidelines, sharing information to health professionals and to the public. However, some countries remain ill-equipped, have poor diagnostic capacity and are in need of further capacity development in response to public health threats. It is essential that EMPHNET and FETPs continue building the capacity to respond to COVID-19 and intensify support for preparedness and response to public health emergencies.",
