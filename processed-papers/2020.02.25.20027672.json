            "Our result suggests that there is a significantly higher mortality risk of COVID-19 for seniors than the previous report[11]. It is probably due to the published report didn\u2019t account for the increasing death of the identified COVID-19 cases. In the previous study, the crude mortality rate is only 2.3%, but the rate is approaching 3.7% on March 4th,<br/><br/>(3,015 deaths among 80,566 identified COVID-19 cases). As of March 4th, 2020, there were still 5,952 COVID-19 patients in severe condition in China. It has been reported that the survival probability of critically ill patients continuously decreased with the increase of time since admission to the intensive care unit [12]. Our analysis was based on the composition of the age of the different populations, and therefore it is less affected by the disease progression of patients, especially the increasing death of critically ill patients. Age has been reported as the independent predictor of adverse outcome in SARS and MERS. Comorbidities and low immune function of older people might be the major cause of higher mortality of coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, 11].

            "However, human-to-human transmission has frequently been occurring and that the epidemic has been gradually growing[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. As of March 4th, 2020, 80566 laboratoryconfirmed cases have been reported in China. Internationally, more than 14396 cases have been reported in 77 countries[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] The number of infected individuals is far surpassing that of SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, suggests that age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcomes[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].

However, a relatively accurate evaluation of incidence and mortality is required that will help refine the risk assessment and ensure that the public and patients are managed in an effective way.",
            "Therefore, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the risks for individual groups of different ages and gender. In this report, we show our initial analysis of the public data from local authorities. Our study shows that the incidence risk of COVID-19 might be as low as 0.1 for children while it could be over 0.9 for 40-years old adults. Our result also suggests that the mortality risk might be above 0.2 for patients older than 80 years old.

            "eliminate the concern that the high mortality risk of older people may inflate the mortality rate of infected population, we further imputed the mortality rate of the infected people as P( Mortality | Infection) = \u2211 P ( Mortality, Agei | Infection) .",
            "The public data of a total of 5319 identified COVID-19 cases were included in our analysis. There were 2829 (53.2%) males and 2490 (46.8%) females in the COVID-19 cases, the male to female ratio turned out roughly equal across all age groups. The age of COVID-19 patients ranged from 0.5 to 97 years, with a mean of 45.2 years. The age and gender composition of COVID-19 patients and the public reference is presented in",
            "We collected detailed information of 76 fatal cases and plotted the age composition of the cases and the general public in Figure 1. It is evident that death occurs more frequently in older people but rare for patients under 40 years old. The fatal cases were from 34 to 89 years old, with an average age of 71.47 and a standard deviation of 12.49.",
            "Based on the age composition of 5319 COVID-19 cases and the 1,144,648 individuals of general public, we estimated the incidence risk in a maximum likelihood approach. Our result shows that the disease can happen in all age groups, and there lacks a significant difference between males and females (Figure 2). The difference in incidence risk for different gender is observed only for the groups between 15 and 50 years old. After the age of 15, males have a slightly higher incidence risk than women, but the increase is ignorable for people over 50 years old. Our result does not support a previous report that SARS-CoV-2 generally affects more males than females in the epidemic8. The incidence risk is low for children and teenagers but rapidly increases for adults. For adults over 40-years old, the risk is higher than 0.9 when they have full exposure to the virus.",
            "In our assessment for mortality risk, there is a significantly higher mortality risk in older adults (Figure 3). The estimated fatal probability is less than 0.01 for individuals under 40 years old, but it is more than 0.51 for people older than 90 years. The calculated risk is much higher than the previous reports. Our result is consistent with most of the earlier studies, supporting the hypothesis that older age is associated with an increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our analysis of the total of 76 fatal cases suggests a mortality rate of 2.38% for general infection. However, we noticed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 in reports is significantly different between identified cases of Hubei province and that of other parts of China [11].",
            "To compare mortality risk between Hubei and other provinces of China, we divided 76 fatal cases into two subsets, 45 cases from Hubei province and 31 cases from other parts of China. The aforementioned statistical analysis for mortality risk is applied to the two subsets with nine different age groups each. To account for variability, we further obtained a standard deviation of estimations by applying the same method on simulated data sets that generated with initial estimation. Our result shows that mortality risk is no more than 0.13 \u00b1 0.10 for people over 80 years old outside Hubei province, but the risk is as high as 0.60\u00b10.15 for the corresponding age group in Hubei province (Figure 4).

            "Our result suggests that there is a significantly higher mortality risk of COVID-19 for seniors than the previous report[11]. It is probably due to the published report didn\u2019t account for the increasing death of the identified COVID-19 cases. In the previous study, the crude mortality rate is only 2.3%, but the rate is approaching 3.7% on March 4th,",
            "(3,015 deaths among 80,566 identified COVID-19 cases). As of March 4th, 2020, there were still 5,952 COVID-19 patients in severe condition in China. It has been reported that the survival probability of critically ill patients continuously decreased with the increase of time since admission to the intensive care unit [12]. Our analysis was based on the composition of the age of the different populations, and therefore it is less affected by the disease progression of patients, especially the increasing death of critically ill patients. Age has been reported as the independent predictor of adverse outcome in SARS and MERS. Comorbidities and low immune function of older people might be the major cause of higher mortality of coronaviruses[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, 11]. Prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce the mortality of seniors[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>].",
            "Our data showed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 is five times higher in Hubei province than that in other parts of China. On the one hand, this difference may be partially explained by insufficient medical resources due to such a large amount of patients in Hubei Province in the breakout. On the other hand, detailed information on the majority part of fatal cases (40 of 45 in total) from Hubei province was published before January 25th, 2019. The mortality rate of early reported cases may be overstated because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. However, we strongly suggest international authorities try their best immediately to prevent too many",
            "COVID-19 patients overloading their health care system. Our hypothesis that a smoothrunning health care system can effectively reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19 is strongly supported by the low mortality rate in other parts of China.",

            "Our data shows a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for old adults. Therefore, it is prudent to strengthen the tertiary preventive and clinical care of old aged patients to reduce mortality. Furthermore, our results also support that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less. Our study could be of value to medical authorities to implement effective medical service. The lack of complete data for all COVID-19 cases potentially increases the occurrence of selection and measurement biases in this study.
