His temperature on admission was 37.8\u00b0C (100.04\u00b0F). Pulmonary auscultation was normal. Laboratory studies showed a normal white blood cell count (4.6 \u00d7 109/L) with a differential count of 53.1% neutrophils. The blood procalcitonin level was normal. Chest CT showed multiple peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs with more involvement of the left upper lobe, lingular segment (Figure a\u2013c). At admission, the real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of the sputum was negative nucleic acid assay was also negative at this time. Six days after admission, the third RT-PCR 2019-nCoV nucleic acid assay was finally found to be positive.",
