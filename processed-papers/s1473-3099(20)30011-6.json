            "As of Jan 12, 2020, an outbreak of severe respiratory disease of unknown origin has affected 41 individuals and killed one in Wuhan, in central China.

            "On Jan 12, 2020, Chinese health authorities made public the genetic sequence of the new type of coronavirus, says WHO, adding that other respiratory infectious agents, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza and avian influenza virus, and adenovirus were ruled out through laboratory tests, as the cause of this outbreak. When interviewed at the time, Jianguo Xu, director of the State Key Laboratory for Infectious Diseases Prevention and Control, China CDC (Beijing, China) told The Lancet Infectious Diseases, \u201cAs I understand, some people may fear [that] this is another epidemic caused by SARS-like or MERS-like virus. But, in my opinion, this is not the case. Phylogenetically, the new coronavirus is not closely related with SARS or MERS virus, but closely related with other viruses carried by bats. Epidemiologically, this is a limited outbreak, with no new patient reported so far from local public health authority. If no new patient appear, the outbreak may be over.\u201d",

            "Jan 2, the infection can be regarded as under control\u201d. However, the report in Thailand of the case of pneumonia caused by this new type of coronavirus in a Chinese traveller from Wuhan puts in question Xu and Hui\u2019s assessment that the outbreak might be already under control. WHO recommends that investigations should continue to identify the source of the outbreak and any animal reservoirs or intermediate hosts.",
            "Experts believe China is able to tackle this situation as early as possible with its strong infrastructure and resources. Gauden Galea, WHO representative in China, told The Lancet Infectious Diseases, \u201cChina has a comprehensive system for monitoring flu, pneumonia, and other illnesses, and detecting unusual patterns amongst patients, as well as strong public health capacities and resources to respond to and manage respiratory disease outbreaks\u201d. Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, said, \u201cThe federal CDC and provincial CDCs are far stronger now than they were during the SARS outbreak, better funded, and working more transparently with WHO and international collaborators\u201d. According to Leo Poon, professor at the School of Public Health, at the University of Hong Kong, for immediate actions, China should carry out aggressive contact tracing, identify the virus source in the market, and confirm whether there is any chance of human to human transmission. In long-term, the settings of the market should be reviewed; it also necessary to find if there are ways to help reduce zoonotic transmission\u2019s risk in such settings."
