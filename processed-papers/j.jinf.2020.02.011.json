Although the epidemic in Wuhan is serious, a large number of medical staff rushed to Wuhan to supplement the shortage of manpower in Wuhan hospitals. This is a battle without smoke, the heroes of which are our medical staff. According to the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, as of January 30, 2020, Hubei Province opened 11,000 isolated patient beds, and about 170,000 healthcare professionals from all kinds of medical institutions are working on the front lines and providing care for patients with fevers, and for suspected or confirmed patients. In this time of emergency, under the unified deployment of the Chinese government, there are 52 medical teams including 6097 medical personnel from the National Health Commission, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, 29 provinces and cities, as well as the army (Fig. 1).",

The Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army has transferred 1400 medical personnel to undertake the task of helping people infected with the virus.",
