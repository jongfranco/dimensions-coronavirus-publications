            "In this the 21st century, medical virology can be said to have entered its post-modern phase; but what is implied by that? In 1900, viruses were an unopened book with no direct evidence of their existence. Now, however, it is possible to read a virus genome from beginning to end, and with next generation sequencing (NGS) it is possible to do so almost instantaneously. At the same time, virological diagnosis has become more precise, and the immunological memory of virus infections has been made sharper than ever. Suppression and cure of virus infections is beginning to be realised, spread of important viral pathogens is being interrupted, and the eradication of a few of them has largely been realised if not universally so.",
            "In all these instances goals can only be achieved if Society's leaders are persuaded that the benefits are desirable, cost-effective and, as appropriate, urgent. The academic virologist must therefore regard clinical and public health advocacy as at least as important as dwelling upon his/her particular loci of research, and they must offer their students a broad grasp of the ecology of virus infections. For almost all of their students this will be more important than the minutiae of virus genomics. The students of today are the clinical decisiontakers of tomorrow, and they need to understand the interface between virus pathogens and humans."
