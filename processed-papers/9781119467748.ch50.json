        "abstract": "Emerging CNS infections are those that have newly emerged or re\u2010emerged in the last two decades. These may be caused by newly recognized microbes or re\u2010emergence of known microbes resulting in an increased number of infections after a decline in incidence. Many of these CNS infections are caused by viruses, but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic (protozoa) infections are also recognized. Newer and more advanced molecular techniques have helped speed up microbial identification and expedited diagnosis of outbreaks caused by both newly emerging and re\u2010emerging microbes. In this chapter, the major or significant microbes that have caused these outbreaks or epidemics are highlighted, and the reasons why they have come into prominence are considered.",
