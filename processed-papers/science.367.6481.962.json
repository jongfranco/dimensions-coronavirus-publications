            "Dye and others say it\u2019s time to rethink the public health response. So far, efforts have focused on containment: slowing the spread of the virus within China, keeping it from being exported to other countries, and, when patients do cross borders, aggressively tracing anyone they were in contact with and quarantining those people for 2 weeks. But if the virus, named SARSCoV-2, has gone global, travel restrictions may become less effective than measures to limit outbreaks and reduce their impact, wherever they are\u2014for instance, by closing schools, preparing hospitals, or even imposing the kind of draconian quarantine imposed on huge cities in China.",
            "\u201cBorder measures will not be as effective or even feasible, and the focus will be on community mitigation measures until a vaccine becomes available in sufficient quantities,\u201d says Luciana Borio, a former biodefense preparedness expert at the U.S National Security Council who is now vice president at In-Q-Tel, a not-for-profit venture capital firm. \u201cThe fight now is to mitigate, keep the health care system working, and don\u2019t panic,\u201d adds Alessandro Vespignani, an infectious disease modeler at Northeastern University. \u201cThis has a range of outcomes from the equivalent of a very bad flu season to something that is perhaps a little bit worse than that.\u201d",
            "Public health experts disagree, however, about how quickly the travel restrictions that have marked the first phase of the epidemic should be loosened. Early this week, the total number of cases stood at more than 80,000 with 2705 deaths\u2014with 97% of the total still in China. Some countries have gone so far as to ban all flights to and from China; the United States quarantines anyone who has been in hard-hit Hubei province and refuses entry to foreign nationals if they have been anywhere in China during the past 2 weeks. Several countries have also added restrictions against South Korea and Iran.",
            "The restrictions have worked to some degree, scientists say. \u201cIf we had not put a travel restriction on, we would have had many, many, many more travel-related cases than we have,\u201d says Anthony Fauci, who heads the U.S National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",
            "But many epidemiologists have claimed that travel bans buy little extra time, and WHO doesn\u2019t endorse them. The received wisdom is that bans can backfire, for example, by hampering the flow of necessary medical supplies and eroding public trust. And as the list of affected countries grows, the bans will become harder to enforce and will make less sense: There is little point in spending huge amounts of resources to keep out the occasional infected person if you already have thousands in your own country. The restrictions also come at a steep price. China\u2019s economy has already taken an enormous hit from COVID-19, as has the airline industry. China also exports many products, from pharmaceuticals to cellphones, and manufacturing disruptions are causing massive supply chain problems.",
            "\u201cIt would be very hard politically and probably not even prudent to relax travel restrictions tomorrow,\u201d says Harvard University epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch. \u201cBut in a week, if the news continues at the pace that it\u2019s been the last few days, I think it will become clear that travel restrictions are not the major countermeasure anymore.\u201d",
            "Smaller scale containment efforts will remain helpful, says WHO\u2019s Bruce Aylward, who led an international mission to China over the past 2 weeks. In a report from the mission that Aylward discussed but did not publicly release, the group concludes that the Chinese epidemic peaked between 23 January and 2 February and that the country\u2019s aggressive containment efforts in Hubei, where at least 50 million people have been on lockdown, gave other provinces time to prepare for the virus and ultimately prevent \u201cprobably hundreds of thousands\u201d of cases. \u201cIt\u2019s important that other countries think about this and think about whether they apply something\u2014not necessarily full lockdowns everywhere, but that same rigorous approach.\u201d",
            "Yet China\u2019s domestic restrictions have come at a huge cost to individuals, says Lawrence Gostin, who specializes in global health policy at Georgetown University Law Center. He calls the policies \u201castounding, unprecedented, and medieval,\u201d and says he is particularly concerned about the physical and mental well-being of people in Hubei who are housebound, under intensive surveillance, and facing shortages of health services. \u201cThis would be unthinkable in probably any country in the world but China,\u201d he says. (Italy\u2019s lockdowns are for relatively small towns, not major cities.)",
            "China is slowly beginning to lift the restrictions in regions at lower risk, which could expose huge numbers of people to the infection, Dye says. \u201cIf normal life is restored in China, then we could expect another resurgence,\u201d he adds.",
            "Still, delaying illness can have a big payoff, Lipsitch says. It will mean a lower burden on hospitals and a chance to better train vulnerable health care workers on how to protect themselves, more time for citizens to prepare, and more time to test potentially life-saving drugs and, in the longer term, vaccines. \u201cIf I had a choice of getting [COVID-19] today or getting it 6 months from now, I would definitely prefer to get it 6 months from now,\u201d Lipsitch says. Flattening the peak of an epidemic also means fewer people are infected overall, he says.",
            "Other countries could adopt only certain elements from China\u2019s strategy. An updated analysis co-authored by Dye and posted on the preprint server medRxiv concludes that suspending public transport, closing entertainment venues, and banning public gatherings were the most effective mitigation interventions in China. \u201cWe don\u2019t have direct proof, of course, because we don\u2019t have a properly controlled experiment,\u201d Dye says. \u201cBut those measures were probably working to push down the number of cases.\u201d One question is whether closing schools will help. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what role kids play\u201d in the epidemic, Lipsitch says. \u201cThat\u2019s something that anybody who has 100 or more cases could start to study.\u201d",
            "Some countries may decide it\u2019s better not to impede the free flow of people too much, keep schools and businesses open, and forgo the quarantining of cities. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a big decision to make with regards to public health,\u201d Dye says, \u201cbecause essentially, it\u2019s saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to let this virus go.\u2019\u201d",
            "To prepare for what\u2019s coming, hospitals can stockpile respiratory equipment and add beds. More intensive use of the vaccines against influenza and pneumococcal infections could help reduce the burden of those respiratory diseases on the health care system and make it easier to identify COVID-19 cases, which produce similar symptoms. Governments can issue messages about the importance of handwashing and staying home if you\u2019re ill.",
            "Whatever the rest of the world does, it\u2019s essential that it take action soon, Aylward says, and he hopes other countries will learn from China. \u201cThe single biggest lesson is: Speed is everything,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you know what worries me most? Has the rest of the world learned the lesson of speed?\u201d j"
