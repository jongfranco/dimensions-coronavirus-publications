            "Among cases reported to the World Health Organization, 15% are severe, 3% are critical, and 82% are mild (press conference WHO, 7 February 2020. https://twitter.com/WHO/status/ 1225797786903277568). The estimated overall case fatality rate is around 2% but outside of Hubei province the figure is around 0.05 or less, not so far from the mortality observed with seasonal influenza. We should not be lulled into inaction by this low fatality rate, however: no cross protection by a common human coronavirus infection is expected and SARS-CoV-2 can theoretically infect any one of us. As with influenza, the complications from covid-19 target particularly older people, but the disease can also strike unpredictably in younger age groups.",
            "A lower risk of complications is good news for individuals, but a mild disease presentation allows a larger chain of transmission through populations. A rapid understanding of the spectrum of the disease and the extent of unrecognised infections is essential. Beyond small series, such as the one by Xu and colleagues, we need more detailed information on the epidemiology at country level. Importantly, more than two months after the first observed cases, we still have a limited understanding of the epidemiological trajectory of this infection. WHO has reported the dates of diagnosis, but this is not enough. Public release of all available data on the timing of symptom onset should be a top priority. Wider testing for covid-19 among patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections should also be considered."

            "Most patients described in Xu and colleagues\u2019 case series had unproved treatments. A range of different drugs and molecules are currently under evaluation. Remedesevir, a nucleotide analogue, is active against covid-19 in vitro[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] and has been shown to be safe in Ebola trials.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] HIV antiproteases, with or without",
            "inhaled interferon, are currently being tested against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Evaluations during the 2002-03 SARS outbreak were, however, inconclusive.",
            "Surprisingly, anti-influenza drugs umifenovir and oseltamivir are also under investigation, despite the lack of biological rationale. Monoclonal antibodies as passive prophylactic or therapeutic immunotherapy are an attractive option, although antibodies used to treat respiratory syncytial virus or influenza have not been successful so far.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] Steroids and methylprednisolone seem to be used frequently, but they prolong viral shedding in patients with MERS-CoV and WHO advises against their use in covid-19, except for patients with an associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other interventions under evaluation include hydroxychloroquine, vitamin C, and elements of Chinese medicine. With any antiviral treatments, timely administration before complications develop will be crucial.",
            "Randomised controlled trials of the most promising treatments are a leading priority, and, hopefully, the road to an effective treatment and vaccine will not be too long. But despite the urgency generated by the emergence of a new disease, health providers and researchers must maintain a rigorous evidence based approach underpinned by sound ethical rules. \u201cFirst, do no harm\u201d must still be the guiding principle.",
