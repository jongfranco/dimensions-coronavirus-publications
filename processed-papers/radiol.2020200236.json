Ground-glass opacities are seen in the posterior segment of right upper lobe and apical posterior segment of left superior lobe. B, Image obtained 3 days after follow-up shows progressive ground-glass opacities in the posterior segment of right upper lobe and apical posterior segment of left superior lobe. The bilateralism of the peripheral lung opacities, without subpleural sparing, are common CT findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.",
