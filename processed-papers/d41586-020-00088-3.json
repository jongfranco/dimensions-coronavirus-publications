His former assistant, Zhang Lei, received a sentence of more than 5 years for allegedly helping.",
            "Zhang admitted to the charges, according to Xinhua. But Li denied stealing the money, and said that he had invested unused grant funding with the intention of using it for future research, according to the Chinese newspaper Economic Observer.",
            "Li\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. Some Chinese media reported that Li is likely to appeal.",

It is the first Earth-sized planet discovered by TESS that lies in its star\u2019s habitable zone. Gilbert reported the discovery on 6 January at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Hawaii.",

China has now publicly shared the virus\u2019s genetic sequence.",

            "Those are the findings of an investigation conducted by law firm Goodwin Procter on the university\u2019s behalf. MIT released the report on 10 January.",
            "MIT president Rafael Reif did not know that the university was accepting money from Epstein while it was taking place, the report found, but three senior administrators drew up an \u201cinformal framework\u201d in 2013 to accept money from Epstein. \u201cNo Senior Team member violated any law, breached any MIT policy, or acted in pursuit of personal gain in connection with Epstein\u2019s donations,\u201d the report says.",
            "In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to two felony charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and served more than a year in prison. He died by suicide in August while awaiting trial on federal charges of trafficking under-age girls.",
            "The bulk of Epstein\u2019s donations to MIT occurred after his guilty plea. The report found that former director of the MIT Media Lab Joi Ito and mechanicalengineering professor Seth Lloyd were key to maintaining the relationship with Epstein.",
            "Lloyd received $225,000 in research funds and $60,000 as a personal gift. He \u201cpurposefully failed to inform MIT\u201d that Epstein was funding his work, the report said. MIT has placed Lloyd on paid administrative leave. \u201cJust heard myself and so can\u2019t comment right now,\u201d Lloyd said. Ito did not respond to a request for comment."
