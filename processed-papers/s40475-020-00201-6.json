        "abstract": "Purpose of Review The goal of this review is to provide a timely overview on efforts to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Recent Findings Previous research efforts to develop a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine in the years following the 2003 pandemic have opened the door for investigators to design vaccine concepts and approaches for the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high degree of genetic similarity and bind to the same host cell ACE2 receptor. Based on previous experience with SARS-CoV vaccines, it is expected that all COVID-19 vaccines will require careful safety evaluations for immunopotentiation that could lead to increased infectivity or eosinophilic infiltration. Besides this, a COVID-19 vaccine target product profile must address vaccinating at-risk human populations including frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 60, and those with underlying and debilitating chronic conditions. Among the vaccine technologies under evaluation are whole virus vaccines, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. Summary Each current vaccine strategy has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is paramount that multiple strategies be advanced quickly and then evaluated for safety and efficacy. Ultimately, the safety studies to minimize undesired immunopotentiation will become the most significant bottleneck in terms of time.",

            "<strong>Concluding Statement</strong><br/><br/>There are now at least a half-dozen candidates, including live viruses, recombinant protein subunits, and nucleic acids that may ultimately offer promise as preventive vaccines against COVID-19. However, each of these vaccines may require additional manufacturing steps and formal toxicology testing before submitting a regulatory package to national regulatory agencies and be able to commence the clinical development, first with phase 1 clinical trials for safety and immunogenicity, and later, phase 2 and phase 3 trials for both safety and efficacy. The next few months represent a critical period for determining whether the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan and Central China will spread across Asia and globally, or whether the warmer months of spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere will reduce transmission of typically seasonal coronavirus infections. In the former situation, we will urgently require new vaccines. However, the challenge remains. Moving forward, we must recognize that we have had a new major coronavirus epidemic every decade in the twenty-first century\u2014SARS in the 2000s, MERS in the 2010s, and now COVID-19.

            "Purpose of Review The goal of this review is to provide a timely overview on efforts to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Recent Findings Previous research efforts to develop a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine in the years following the 2003 pandemic have opened the door for investigators to design vaccine concepts and approaches for the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high degree of genetic similarity and bind to the same host cell ACE2 receptor. Based on previous experience with SARS-CoV vaccines, it is expected that all COVID-19 vaccines will require careful safety evaluations for immunopotentiation that could lead to increased infectivity or eosinophilic infiltration. Besides this, a COVID-19 vaccine target product profile must address vaccinating at-risk human populations including frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 60, and those with underlying and debilitating chronic conditions. Among the vaccine technologies under evaluation are whole virus vaccines, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. Summary Each current vaccine strategy has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is paramount that multiple strategies be advanced quickly and then evaluated for safety and efficacy. Ultimately, the safety studies to minimize undesired immunopotentiation will become the most significant bottleneck in terms of time.",
            "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China, linked initially to animal-to-human transmission in local wet markets. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission of the virus commenced, resulting in widespread respiratory illness in Wuhan and other urban areas of Hubei Province, China. The coronavirus then spread across China and at least 20 other nations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. On February 11, the World Health Organization named the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the syndrome was named COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]. Although not as lethal as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, COVID-19 is still characterized by severe respiratory illness and significant mortality, especially among individuals over the age of 60 years and"

        "The Strategies": [
            "Shown in Table 1 is a summary of the major COVID-19 vaccines under development. This list is not exhaustive but instead reflects some of the major vaccines highlighted in company materials or publicly available documents, including biocentury.com [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].",
            "Whole Virus Vaccines Live-attenuated or inactive whole virus vaccines represent a classic strategy for viral vaccinations. According to an industry newsletter, Johnson & Johnson is one of the few multinational companies embarking on COVID-19 vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]; similar to their Ebola vaccine platform, they are employing Janssen\u2019s AdVac\u00ae adenoviral vector and manufacturing in their PER.C6\u00ae cell line technology [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. In addition, researchers at the University of Hong Kong have developed a live influenza vaccine that expresses SARS-CoV-2 proteins [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Finally, Codagenix has developed a \u201ccodon deoptimization\u201d technology to attenuate viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] and is exploring SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies. A major advantage of whole virus vaccines is their inherent immunogenicity and ability to stimulate toll-like receptors (TLRs) including TLR 3, TLR 7/8, and TLR 9. However, live virus vaccines often require extensive additional testing to confirm their safety. This is especially an issue for coronavirus vaccines, given the findings of increased infectivity following immunization with live or killed whole virus SARS coronavirus vaccines [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].",
            "Subunit Vaccines Subunit vaccines for both SARS coronaviruses rely on eliciting an immune response against the S-spike protein to prevent its docking with the host ACE2 receptor [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Already, under funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), the University of Queensland is synthesizing viral surface proteins, to present them more easily to the immune system. Moreover, Novavax has developed and produced immunogenic virus-like nanoparticles based on recombinant expression of the S-protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>] while Clover Biopharmaceuticals is developing a subunit vaccine consisted of a trimerized SARS-CoV-2 S-protein using their patented Trimer-Tag\u00ae technology [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], although some full-length S-proteins for SARS also elicit increased infectivity and eosinophilic infiltration. Accordingly, a consortium led by Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine (including University of Texas Medical Branch and New York Blood Center) has developed and tested a subunit vaccine comprised of only the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV S-protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. When formulated on alum, the SARSCoV RBD vaccine elicits high levels of protective immunity on the homologous virus challenge. An advantage of the RBD-based vaccine is its ability to minimize host immunopotentiation [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. Initial findings that the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs exhibit more than 80% amino acid similarity and bind to the same ACE2 receptor offer an opportunity to develop either protein as a subunit vaccine.",
