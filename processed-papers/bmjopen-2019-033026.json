        "abstract": "ObjectivesThis study aimed to assess the affective and cognitive risk perceptions in the general population of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) during the 2015 MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea and the influencing factors.DesignSerial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys.SettingNationwide general population in South Korea.ParticipantsOverall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included.Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions.ResultsBoth affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72\u20132.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19\u20133.11; 95\u2009CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55\u20135.41; 95\u2009CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions.ConclusionsThis study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public\u2019s risk perception for e\ufb00ective risk communication.",

            "Participants Between 9 June and 2 July 2015, a total of 4010 participants who were 19 years and older were monitored using a serial cross-s\u00adectional study design in four consecutive surveys, covering the MERS epidemic. All surveys were conducted using mobile (85%) or landline (15%) random digit dialling numbers in eight regions which was representative of nationwide. Samples were selected after stratification by gender, age and province. The total number of weighted cases in this survey equals the total number of unweighted cases at the national level. The weights were normalised in order to calculate proportions and ratios; however; not for estimating the number of the subtotal populations. Trained interviewers conducted all interviews using computer-a\u00adssisted telephone interviewing. The first survey was conducted between 9 and 11 June 2015 after the 1 June 2015 occurrence of the first tertiary infected case. The last was conducted just 2 days before the last confirmed patient on 4 July 2015. The surveys were conducted by Gallup Korea, an affiliation of Gallup International. Details including period, number of respondents successfully interviewed and response rate for each of the four surveys are provided in table 1."

        "results": [
            "Demographic factors The general characteristics of the participants are shown in table 2. There were no statistically significant differences between surveys except self-r\u00adeported household economic status, affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. Nearly half of the participants were female, aged <50 years, educated up to high school or below, from the affected area and showed disapproval of the president or the ruling party. Majority of the participants were employed, of middle economic status and metropolitan. More than half of participants were worried but had views that the epidemic would subside.<br/><br/>Epidemic curve and time trends of risk perception Figure 1 reports how the outbreak proceeded, with three overlapping transmission periods, the timing of the four independent surveys and the risk perception rates. Differences were investigated between affective and cognitive risk proportions throughout the epidemic periods. Overall risk perception of the four surveys at affective proportion (53.8%) was nearly two times higher than at cognitive dimension (30.3%). Affective risk perception proportions were always higher than cognitive dimension during the present study periods. Of the affective risk perception, proportion was initially high during survey 1 (55.0%), rose during survey 2 (62.8%) and declined again during surveys 3 and 4 (52.2% and 44.9%, respectively). A similar trend was observed in the cognitive risk perception proportions. The percentages of respondents who reported as being \u2018worried\u2019 or \u2018spread further\u2019 decreased gradually after survey 2. Cognitive risk perception proportions decreased more rapidly than affective aspect, over time, from 52.6% and 62.8% in survey 2 to 9.0% and 44.9% in survey 4, respectively. At the beginning of the occurrences of tertiary and quaternary cases, we identified high perceived risk in both the affective and cognitive aspect proportions."

        "discussion": [
            "The aims of the present study were to explore the differences in risk perception at affective and cognitive dimensions and examine the relationship between trust in government and both risk perceptions. To do this end, we investigated the pattern of affective and cognitive risk perception proportions during MERS-\u00adCoV epidemic, respectively; analysed the correlations of presidential job approval rating and risk perceptions (affective and cognitive).<br/><br/>First, we found that affective risk perception responded faster and lasts longer. The affective risk perception proportions were always higher than at the cognitive dimension. Risk perception increased with new generations of transmission, such as with the tertiary and quaternary infections. Both risk perceptions tended to decrease over time and the cognitive risk perception declined more rapidly."
        ],
        "conclusions": [
            "This study is the first to evaluate the differences in risk perception at affective and cognitive dimensions and the relationship between trust in the government and both risk perceptions during the MERS-\u00adCoV outbreak in South Korea. The study also reported various factors influencing risk perception. We found that affective risk perception responded faster and lasts longer; and low trust in the government influenced both affective and cognitive risk perceptions. Quality of risk communication can create conditions for modulating the easy spread of emerging contagious diseases. To prevent the failure of epidemic management, further efforts are needed to understand the mechanism behind the general public\u2019s risk perception, the governmental public health sector, as well as the society of academy. Planning and implementation of strategies that consider the risk awareness mechanism will be a significant step in the right direction during national infectious disease crises."

        "Background": [
            "Newly emerging contagious diseases have created a novel chance to examine how people perceive risk during an epidemic. In South Korea, since the occurrence of the index case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) on 20 May 2015, a total of 186 persons were diagnosed with the disease, 38 of whom had died and 16 693 patients were quarantined.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>] The epidemic of MERS coronavirus (MERS-C\u00ad oV) has had its largest outbreak outside of the Middle East in South Korea.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] The occurrence of multiple transmissions after the first secondary infection and the failure of the government on risk communication resulted in the increased concern of the general public.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] The Korean government did not disclose timely information about the outbreak of MERS-\u00adCoV, such as lists",
            "of affected medical institutions.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>] Due to increased public anxiety about MERS-\u00adCoV, the trust in the Korean government had fallen and the image of the Korean president as a leader had been damaged.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]",
            "During contagious disease epidemics, perceived risk can have a significant impact on precautionary behaviours that might affect disease transmission.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] A relevant empirical study emphasised that informing public about the disease outbreak, such as the Ebola virus, could reduce worry about contracting the virus and take more preventive measures.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] The evaluation of public risk perception of disease helps us to know what knowledge the public needs. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of risk perception and factors relating to how people perceive the risk is important in terms of minimising the impact of spread of infectious disease.",
            "Given that external stimuli are extreme events, two different reactions can occur: the affective reaction (risk as feelings) and cognitive reaction (risk as analysis).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] Previous studies suggest that affective reaction is quick, intuitive and automatic, while cognitive reaction is slow, deliberate and probably calculative. In the early phase of the outbreak, people may experience challenges when attempting to quantify the risk, which may lead to an affective reaction.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] In contrast, cognitive reaction may occur during the late stage of the epidemic.",
            "Most people may not conduct deliberate risk analysis when they cope with lack of knowledge about risk, such as new disease outbreak, but rely on simple heuristics.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] Heuristic processing can be understood as simple decision rule of thumb or mental shortcut that can reduce the complexity of decision-m\u00ad aking. When risk management decisions are needed, trust in the institutions can be used as one of the heuristics.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] People having trust in the responsible risk manager, such as the government, may perceive less risk in a particular situation than people not having trust.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>] Regarding the MERS epidemic in South Korea, less trust in the government affected increasing number of individuals\u2019 risk perception.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>] Trust is known to be related to cognitive risk perception and to affective risk perception.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]",
            "However, when assessing the influence of trust in risk perception, many studies have not distinguished between affective and cognitive reactions regarding contagious diseases during outbreaks.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>] We hypothesised that (1) affective risk perception would increase and decrease faster than cognitive risk perception over time and that (2) low trust in government would be related with high-\u00adrisk perception (both affective and cognitive)."

            "Participants Between 9 June and 2 July 2015, a total of 4010 participants who were 19 years and older were monitored using a serial cross-s\u00adectional study design in four consecutive surveys, covering the MERS epidemic. All surveys were conducted using mobile (85%) or landline (15%) random digit dialling numbers in eight regions which was representative of nationwide. Samples were selected after stratification by gender, age and province. The total number of weighted cases in this survey equals the total number of unweighted cases at the national level. The weights were normalised in order to calculate proportions and ratios; however; not for estimating the number of the subtotal populations. Trained interviewers conducted all interviews using computer-a\u00adssisted telephone interviewing. The first survey was conducted between 9 and 11 June 2015 after the 1 June 2015 occurrence of the first tertiary infected case. The last was conducted just 2 days before the last confirmed patient on 4 July 2015. The surveys were conducted by Gallup Korea, an affiliation of Gallup International. Details including period, number of respondents successfully interviewed and response rate for each of the four surveys are provided in table 1.",
            "Demographic factors evaluated as respondents\u2019 characteristics included gender, age, educational attainment, occupation, self-\u00adreported household economic status, residential area, and trust in president, party identification. Age was classified into six levels (19\u201329, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70 years and older). Educational attainment was classified into four levels (less than middle school, high school, university, graduate school or higher). Occupation was classified as either unemployed, farming/ forestry/fishery, self-\u00ademployed, blue-c\u00ad ollar worker, white-\u00ad collar worker, full-\u00adtime home maker or student. Self-\u00ad reported household economic status was classified into five levels (lower, lower middle, middle, upper middle, upper). Respondents were classified as either metropolitan or non-\u00admetropolitan residents; and distinguished by whether they resided in an area where MERS had occurred or not.

            "Survey instruments The interviews were conducted based on two aspects of the risk perception, which are affective and cognitive risk perceptions (see online supplementary material). Affective risk perception was assessed using the question \u2018How much worried are you that you could get MERS?\u2019 Responses were assessed on a 4-\u00adpoint scale, with 4 points indicating \u2018very much worried\u2019 and 1 point indicating \u2018not worried at all\u2019 (reclassified as 1\u20132 points=\u2018not worried\u2019; 3\u20134 points=\u2018worried\u2019). Affective risk perception proportion was defined as the number of participants who were \u2018worried\u2019 by the number of eligible respondents. Cognitive risk perception was evaluated using the question \u2018Do you think MERS epidemic will settle down in the next few days or spread further?\u2019 and required the following responses: \u2018will settle down\u2019, \u2018will spread further\u2019. Cognitive risk perception proportion was defined as the number of participants whose response was \u2018will spread further\u2019 by the number of eligible respondents. Trust in government was assessed using presidential job approval rating. Trust in government includes expectations of government\u2019s competence to prevent people from risk and develop and implement follow-\u00adup measures.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>] This trust concept can be termed competence-\u00adbased trust.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c32\" href=\"#r32\">32</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>] We tried to assess the competence-\u00adbased trust in the government using presidential job approval rating. Presidential job approval was evaluated using the question \u2018Do you approve or disapprove of the way President Park Geun-h\u00ad ye is handling her job as president?\u2019 and required the following responses: \u2018approval\u2019, \u2018disapproval\u2019. The development of questionnaires on risk perception and trust in the government had not gone through a validity procedure due to the urgency of the outbreak. We also imposed survey items on existing questionnaire developed by Gallup Korea, an affiliation of Gallup International.",
            "Analysis Response rates according to affective or cognitive risk perceptions were calculated over time. Univariate analyses using \u03c72 test were performed in the four consecutive surveys, entirely and respectively, to identify the relationships between risk perception and each demographic variable. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to explore factors influencing risk perceptions (affective and cognitive) in the four surveys, entirely and respectively. Multivariable logistic regression model was adjusted for gender, age, educational attainment, occupation, self-r\u00ad eported household economic status, affected area, residential area, presidential job approval and party identification. The self-\u00adreported household economic status was excluded in survey 4 model with cognitive risk perception.

            "Demographic factors The general characteristics of the participants are shown in table 2. There were no statistically significant differences between surveys except self-r\u00adeported household economic status, affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. Nearly half of the participants were female, aged <50 years, educated up to high school or below, from the affected area and showed disapproval of the president or the ruling party. Majority of the participants were employed, of middle economic status and metropolitan. More than half of participants were worried but had views that the epidemic would subside.",
            "Epidemic curve and time trends of risk perception Figure 1 reports how the outbreak proceeded, with three overlapping transmission periods, the timing of the four independent surveys and the risk perception rates. Differences were investigated between affective and cognitive risk proportions throughout the epidemic periods. Overall risk perception of the four surveys at affective proportion (53.8%) was nearly two times higher than at cognitive dimension (30.3%). Affective risk perception proportions were always higher than cognitive dimension during the present study periods. Of the affective risk perception, proportion was initially high during survey 1 (55.0%), rose during survey 2 (62.8%) and declined again during surveys 3 and 4 (52.2% and 44.9%, respectively). A similar trend was observed in the cognitive risk perception proportions. The percentages of respondents who reported as being \u2018worried\u2019 or \u2018spread further\u2019 decreased gradually after survey 2. Cognitive risk perception proportions decreased more rapidly than affective aspect, over time, from 52.6% and 62.8% in survey 2 to 9.0% and 44.9% in survey 4, respectively. At the beginning of the occurrences of tertiary and quaternary cases, we identified high perceived risk in both the affective and cognitive aspect proportions.",

Groups of older than 40 years were less aware of the risk (aOR 0.58\u20130.76; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.56) in survey 1; however, they perceived the risk more over time (aOR 2.84\u20133.29; 95% CI 1.27 to 6.66) in survey 4. The association of education with affective risk perception was non-\u00adsignificant except university degree in the overall survey (aOR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.96). Lower economic status and those living in metropolitan cities paid more attention to the affective risk of MERS-\u00adCoV in the overall model. Those who disapproved of the president and the ruling party had higher risk perception at the affective dimension; the peak of disapproval was found in survey 1.",
            "Factors associated with the cognitive risk perception Unlike the cognitive risk perception, no difference was found by gender in the cognitive risk perception (table 4). Furthermore, respondents aged 30 years and older were consistently less aware of the cognitive risk during MERS-\u00adCoV epidemic. Generally, no not statistically significant association was found with educational attainment, occupation, self-\u00adreported household economic status, MERS-\u00adCoV-\u00adaffected area and metropolitan area. Similar to the affective dimension, those who disapproved of the president and the ruling party had higher risk perceptions at the cognitive dimension."

            "The aims of the present study were to explore the differences in risk perception at affective and cognitive dimensions and examine the relationship between trust in government and both risk perceptions. To do this end, we investigated the pattern of affective and cognitive risk perception proportions during MERS-\u00adCoV epidemic, respectively; analysed the correlations of presidential job approval rating and risk perceptions (affective and cognitive).",
            "First, we found that affective risk perception responded faster and lasts longer. The affective risk perception proportions were always higher than at the cognitive dimension. Risk perception increased with new generations of transmission, such as with the tertiary and quaternary infections. Both risk perceptions tended to decrease over time and the cognitive risk perception declined more rapidly.",

Those who did not support the president were reported to have had higher risk perception in both the affective and cognitive levels. In the group that did not approve of the president, the probabilities of risk perception were higher at the cognitive dimension than at affective dimension. In the early days of the MERS-\u00adCOV outbreak, the government did not specify details regarding scientifically uncertain information in order to reduce public anxiety over the crisis, nor did the government disclose which hospitals the confirmed patients had visited.

            "Previous studies that investigated risk perception by gender also showed that a lower risk perception was associated with the male gender.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a> <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>] A possible explanation for lower perception of risk by males is that males have more to gain from risky behaviours.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>] However, previous studies did not distinguish between the levels of risk perception. Further research is needed to determine why the same female group showed differences in perceived risk for affective and cognitive levels. The older the respondents, the lower the perceived cognitive dimension, but the opposite occurred weakly in the affective risk perception. The correlation with age and affective risk perception was not significant in most models (survey 1, survey 2 and survey 3 models). After trust in government was adjusted for, we found correlation between older age and lower cognitive risk perception. Further research is needed as to why the effect of trust in the government had not been shown in the affective risk perception.",

Second, this study could not evaluate the intensity of risk perception, because it only included questions focusing on whether or not participants recognised the risk at the different levels.

            "This study is the first to evaluate the differences in risk perception at affective and cognitive dimensions and the relationship between trust in the government and both risk perceptions during the MERS-\u00adCoV outbreak in South Korea. The study also reported various factors influencing risk perception. We found that affective risk perception responded faster and lasts longer; and low trust in the government influenced both affective and cognitive risk perceptions. Quality of risk communication can create conditions for modulating the easy spread of emerging contagious diseases. To prevent the failure of epidemic management, further efforts are needed to understand the mechanism behind the general public\u2019s risk perception, the governmental public health sector, as well as the society of academy. Planning and implementation of strategies that consider the risk awareness mechanism will be a significant step in the right direction during national infectious disease crises.",
