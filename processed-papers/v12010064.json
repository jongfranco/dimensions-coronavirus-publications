        "abstract": "Ebola virus infections lead to severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and nonhuman primates; and human fatality rates are as high as 67%\u201390%. Since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976, the only available treatments have been medical support or the emergency administration of experimental drugs. The absence of licensed vaccines and drugs against the Ebola virus impedes the prevention of viral infection. In this study, we generated recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) expressing the Sudan virus (SUDV) matrix structural protein (VP40) (rBV-VP40-VP40) or the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) (rBV-GP-GP), and SUDV virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by co-infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-SUDV-VP40 and rBV-SUDV-GP. The expression of SUDV VP40 and GP in SUDV VLPs was demonstrated by IFA and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy results demonstrated that SUDV VLPs had a filamentous morphology. The immunogenicity of SUDV VLPs produced in insect cells was evaluated by the immunization of mice. The analysis of antibody responses showed that mice vaccinated with SUDV VLPs and the adjuvant Montanide ISA 201 produced SUDV GP-specific IgG antibodies. Sera from SUDV VLP-immunized mice were able to block infection by SUDV GP pseudotyped HIV, indicating that a neutralizing antibody against the SUDV GP protein was produced. Furthermore, the activation of B cells in the group immunized with VLPs mixed with Montanide ISA 201 was significant one week after the primary immunization. Vaccination with the SUDV VLPs markedly increased the frequency of antigen-specific cells secreting type 1 and type 2 cytokines. To study the therapeutic effects of SUDV antibodies, horses were immunized with SUDV VLPs emulsified in Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant or Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant. The results showed that horses could produce SUDV GP-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. These results showed that SUDV VLPs demonstrate excellent immunogenicity and represent a promising approach for vaccine development against SUDV infection. Further, these horse anti-SUDV purified immunoglobulins lay a foundation for SUDV therapeutic drug research.",

The SUDV VLPs were harvested from the culture supernatant and purified as described in the Material and Methods. To further characterize the structure of the SUDV VLPs, we examined purified material by transmission electron microscopy.

The efficacy of different types of vaccines may vary depending on the vaccine platform: antibody is the major immune correlate factor of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Meanwhile, CD8 T cell responses have been attributed to protection by the Ch-Ad5 vaccine [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. Previous VLP vaccine studies showed it is efficacious against lethal Ebola challenge, however, with different adjuvants to save antigen and enhance vaccine-induced immune responses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>].",
            "The impact of SUDV outbreaks in recent years, and the potential for viral spread to non-endemic regions or countries, makes the development of safe and efficacious vaccines urgent.",
            "Previous findings revealed that SUDV VLPs could be readily assembled by the co-expression of baculoviruses expressing GP, NP and VP40 in insect cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. Here, we demonstrated that co-infection of rBV-GP-GP and rBV-VP40-VP40 recombinant baculoviruses can result in the successful assembly of VLPs in insect cells, the morphology of SUDV VLPs is similar to a native virus, and the immunogenicity of VLPs was tested with an ISA 201 adjuvant as a candidate vaccine in mice.",
            "In our study, we generated recombinant baculaviruses rBV-GP-GP and rBV-VP40-VP40 using the pFastBacDual vector to increase the protein production utilizing the dual promoter. To determine the optimal proportion of two recombinant baculaviruses rBV-GP-GP and rBV-VP40-VP40, we also tried to co-infect Sf9 cells with recombinant baculaviruses rBV-GP-GP and rBV-VP40-VP40 at ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3, 2:1, 2.5:1, and 3:1. At a ratio of 2.5:1, the morphology of VLPs was similar to the native virus, as assessed by TEM (Figure 3A). The Western blot result (Figure 3B) showed that SUDV GP and VP40 efficiently assembled SUDV VLPs.",
            "The immunization results depicted the failure of the group vaccinated with 20 \u03bcg of SUDV VLPs-only to stimulate the production of humoral immune responses in mice, while the group vaccinated with 20 \u03bcg of VLPs mixed with an ISA 201 adjuvant could stimulate the production of humoral immunity in mice. Presumably, immunization with 20 \u03bcg of SUDV VLPs-only is an insufficiently low dose of an immunogen that cannot stimulate the mice to produce an immune response, and the use of an ISA 201 adjuvant with SUDV VLPs might cause low-dose immunogens to initiate a response, and using with adjuvant can save antigen amount (Figure 4C). The same SUDV VLPs antigen dose (20 \u03bcg) mix different adjuvants could stimulate mice to produce different degrees humoral immune responses. The ISA 201 adjuvant showed the most effective adjuvant than other adjuvants in mice. The detection of neutralizing antibody showed that sera from mice immunized with 20 \u03bcg SUDV VLPs mixed with ISA 201 adjuvant could neutralize approximately 50% of the pseudotyped viruses at an average 1:320 dilution, while individual samples were effective with as high as a 1:640 dilution (Figure 4D).",
            "Both humoral and cellular responses are indispensable for providing protection. IFN-\u03b3 is a Th1-type cytokine involved in the antiviral action of cellular immune responses and IL-4 is mainly produced by Th2 cells and is associated with humoral immune responses. The SUDV VLPs could effectively stimulate Th1 and Th2 cytokine production in vaccinated mice (Figure 5A,B). The levels of cytokines secreted from splenocytes, such as IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 secreted from Th1 cells (Figure 6A\u2013C) and IL-4 and IL-10 were secreted from Th2 cells (Figure 6D,E), were significantly increased after vaccination. Moreover, our study revealed that the B cells of mice of the group vaccinated with SUDV VLPs mixed with an ISA 201 adjuvant were activated at one week after the primary immunization (Figure 7).",
            "In addition, we have conducted research on therapeutic antibodies with the goal of preparing antibodies for the post-exposure treatment of SUDV. Horses were selected as immunized animals in our study because horse anti-immunoglobulins have been used in the treatment of various viral infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>]. SUDV VLPs can effectively induce humoral immune responses in horses after immunization (Figure 8A). The horse anti-SUDV immunoglobulin was obtained from #392 horse serum through crude extraction and purification. The neutralizing antibody titer of purified #392 IgG was 1:5120, which was one time lower than that before purification (Figure 8B).",
            "We tested the SUDV VLPs immunogenicity and neutralizing activity of hours purified IgG by using pseudo typed viruses, and efficacy studies still need to be performed. These SUDV VLPs vaccine and horse purified IgG provide ideas for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies that could prevent and treat SUDV infections. The Ebola epidemic is still spreading, vaccination is an effective means of preventing and controlling the outbreaks, and effective antibodies represent key drugs for the treatment of Ebola patients.
