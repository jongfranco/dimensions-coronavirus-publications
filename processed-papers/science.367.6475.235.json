Last week, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced that the Electron-Ion Collider will be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. The machine would enable nuclear physicists to probe the mysterious structure of the proton and how its mass and spin emerge from a teeming sea of even smaller subatomic particles inside it. The collider will cost between $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion and could begin to run by 2030. DOE's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia, had also vied to host it.",
