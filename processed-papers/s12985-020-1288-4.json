        "abstract": "Background: Porcine \u03b2-defensin 2 (PBD-2), produced by host cells, is an antimicrobial cysteine-rich cationic peptide with multi-functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that PBD-2 can kill various bacteria, regulate host immune responses and promote growth of piglets. However, the antiviral role of PBD-2 is rarely investigated. This study aimed to reveal the antiviral ability of PBD-2 against pseudorabies virus (PRV), the causative pathogen of Aujeszky\u2019s disease, in PK-15 cells and in a PBD-2 expressing transgenic (TG) mouse model.\nMethods: In this study, the cytotoxicity of PBD-2 on PK-15 cells was measured by CCK-8 assay. PK-15 cells were incubated with PRV pre-treated with different concentrations of PBD-2 and PRV titers in cell culture supernatants were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). TG mice and wild-type (WT) mice were intraperitoneally injected with PRV and the survival rate was recorded for 10 days. Meanwhile, tissue lesions in brain, spleen and liver of infected mice were observed and the viral loads of PRV in brain, liver and lung were analyzed by RT-qPCR.\nResults: PBD-2 at a maximum concentration of 80 \u03bcg/mL displayed no significant cytotoxicity on PK-15 cells. A threshold concentration of PBD-2 at 40 \u03bcg/mL was required to inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells. The survival rate in PBD-2 TG mice was 50% higher than that of WT mice. In addition, TG mice showed alleviated tissue lesions in brain, spleen and liver compared with their WT littermates after PRV challenge, while viral loads of PRV in brain, liver and lung of TG mice were significantly lower than that of WT mice.\nConclusions: PBD-2 could inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells and protect mice from PRV infection, which confirmed the antiviral ability of PBD-2 both in vitro and in vivo. The application of PBD-2 in developing anti-viral drugs or disease-resistant animals can be further investigated.",

            "In summary, within this study, the antiviral effect of PBD-2 in vitro and in vivo were confirmed using PRV infection model. The technique of large-scale production of PBD-2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c45\" href=\"#r45\">45</a>] and the existing transgenic pigs overexpressing PBD-2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] have created possibilities for the application of PBD-2 as novel prophylactic and therapeutic methods against Aujeszky\u2019s disease and other viral diseases. In addition, it is worthy of further studies on the underlying mechanism for the inhibitory effect of PBD-2 on PRV, which will offer more insights regarding antiviral effects of defensins."

        "discussion": [
            "The impact of PBD-2 on viral pathogenicity has not been well examined experimentally yet. A previous study has showed that PBD-2 exhibits antiviral ability against PRRSV when the concentration reaches 64 \u03bcg/mL [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Similarly, in this study, PBD-2 at 40 \u03bcg/mL and 80 \u03bcg/<br/><br/>mL was found to inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells while no significant effect was observed for lower concentrations of PBD-2 (Fig. 1b). These indicate that a threshold concentration is required for PBD-2 to inhibit viral proliferation. According to the survivability, detectable virus copies and pathological changes, the TG mice displayed significantly increased resistance to PRV infection compared with the WT mice. Therefore, the antiviral effect of PBD-2 was confirmed both on cells and in TG mice expressing PBD-2. It has been revealed that defensins can direct inactive enveloped viruses by disrupting viral lipid bilayers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. In this study, PRV was preincubated with PBD-2 and then used to infect cells. According to the result, we hypothesize that PBD-2 might have a direct virucidal effect on PRV by damaging the viral envelopes. Besides, it may also affect PRV entry because PBD-2 was still present during the whole process of viral adsorption. Since PRV shared high structural and sequence similarity with other alphaherpesviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], the antiviral mechanisms of other defensins against alphaherpesviruses would help understand how PBD-2 inhibited PRV proliferation. HNP-4 and HD-6 were capable of block HSV binding by interacting with heparan sulfate, the primary receptor for HSV binding, while HBD-3 with enhanced inhibitory effect against HSV bound both heparan sulfate and gB [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. HD-5 was able to prevent viral adhesion and entry of HSV by binding to both gB and gD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Likewise, rabbit NP-1 and HNP-1, -2, -3 inactivated HSV by preventing viral entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Retrocyclin 2 prevented HSV binding, entry and intercellular spread by binding carbohydrate moieties on glycoprotein B [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. In general, these defensins prevent HSV infection by blocking viral binding, penetration or both. Whether PBD-2 is able to block viral binding and penetration by interacting with specific host membrane receptor(s) can be further studied."

At 6\u20138 weeks of age, TG mice (n = 4) weighing 20 \u00b1 2 g were intraperitoneally injected with 0.2 mL of PRV (2 \u00d7 103.3 TCID50/ mL) each.

        "Discussion": [
            "The impact of PBD-2 on viral pathogenicity has not been well examined experimentally yet. A previous study has showed that PBD-2 exhibits antiviral ability against PRRSV when the concentration reaches 64 \u03bcg/mL [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]. Similarly, in this study, PBD-2 at 40 \u03bcg/mL and 80 \u03bcg/",
            "mL was found to inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells while no significant effect was observed for lower concentrations of PBD-2 (Fig. 1b). These indicate that a threshold concentration is required for PBD-2 to inhibit viral proliferation. According to the survivability, detectable virus copies and pathological changes, the TG mice displayed significantly increased resistance to PRV infection compared with the WT mice. Therefore, the antiviral effect of PBD-2 was confirmed both on cells and in TG mice expressing PBD-2. It has been revealed that defensins can direct inactive enveloped viruses by disrupting viral lipid bilayers [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. In this study, PRV was preincubated with PBD-2 and then used to infect cells. According to the result, we hypothesize that PBD-2 might have a direct virucidal effect on PRV by damaging the viral envelopes. Besides, it may also affect PRV entry because PBD-2 was still present during the whole process of viral adsorption. Since PRV shared high structural and sequence similarity with other alphaherpesviruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], the antiviral mechanisms of other defensins against alphaherpesviruses would help understand how PBD-2 inhibited PRV proliferation. HNP-4 and HD-6 were capable of block HSV binding by interacting with heparan sulfate, the primary receptor for HSV binding, while HBD-3 with enhanced inhibitory effect against HSV bound both heparan sulfate and gB [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. HD-5 was able to prevent viral adhesion and entry of HSV by binding to both gB and gD [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. Likewise, rabbit NP-1 and HNP-1, -2, -3 inactivated HSV by preventing viral entry [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>]. Retrocyclin 2 prevented HSV binding, entry and intercellular spread by binding carbohydrate moieties on glycoprotein B [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c31\" href=\"#r31\">31</a>]. In general, these defensins prevent HSV infection by blocking viral binding, penetration or both. Whether PBD-2 is able to block viral binding and penetration by interacting with specific host membrane receptor(s) can be further studied.",
            "Defensins have been confirmed to be effective to resist pathogens. Chen et al argued that higher expression levels of PBD-2 and other \u03b2-defensins in Meishan pigs than those in crossbred pigs conferred stronger immunity of Meishan pigs against diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. Our previous study revealed that PBD-2 overexpressing pigs and PBD2 TG mice showed enhanced resistance to bacterial infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. In this study, we further verified that PBD-2 TG mice displayed increased resistance to viral infection. Thus, PBD-2 can be a useful target to generate disease-resistant animals against both bacterial and viral infections. PRV is an important pig pathogen which is still present in China, Japan, USA and some European countries [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>]. The inhibitory effect of PBD-2 in vitro and in vivo discovered in this study provided possible new strategies to control PRV, such as overexpressing PBD-2 in pig tissues. In transgenic mice infected with PRV, PBD-2 could reduce viral loads and alleviated tissue lesions at different degrees in different tissues (Figs. 3 and 4). Our previous study has discovered that PBD-2 expression level in organs differed in TG mice [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c39\" href=\"#r39\">39</a>], which suggests a correlation between PBD-2 expression level and its anti-PRV effect in different organs. It is worth noting that PRV loads of brain tissues (Fig. 3) were the highest and damages of brain tissues were the severest (Fig. 4) either in TG mice or in WT mice, confirming that PRV had a distinct tissue tropism [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>]. Herein, increasing PBD-2 expression in animals, especially in brains, using gene-editing techniques might promote the resistance of animals to PRV in vivo.",
            "On the other hand, PBD-2 may be used as drug additives or vaccine adjuvants to develop alternative strategies to control PRV and other viruses. Attempts at using \u03b2-defensins to control viral diseases in vivo have been carried out. Expression of zebrafish \u03b2-defensin 2 in fishes improved their resistance to spring viraemia of carp virus infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c40\" href=\"#r40\">40</a>]. Application of murine \u03b2defensin 2 as a DNA vaccine adjuvant protected mice against H5N1 avian influenza viruses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. In addition, mice intranasally or intratracheally inoculated with P9, a derivative of mouse \u03b2-defensin 4, were protected from infections of three types of influenza A viruses and SARS-associated coronavirus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. Besides, intraperitoneal injection of recombinant mouse \u03b2-defensin 3 (rMBD3) in mice was found to alleviate coxsackievirus B3-induced myocarditis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. Similarly, intravenous injection of rMBD3 improved the survival rate of mice infected with influenza A virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>]."
