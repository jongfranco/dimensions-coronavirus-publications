        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model based on machine learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that many FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.",

For example, the strongest hydrogen (a) Bortezomib, -12.15 kcal/mol (b) 2019-nCoV protease and Bortezomib complex (c) Flurazepam, -10.38 kcal/mol (d) 2019-nCoV protease and Flurazepam complex (e) Ponatinib, -10.25 kcal/mol (f) 2019-nCoV protease and Ponatinib complex bonds are formed by two O atoms in two hydroxyls on the head of Bortezomib and three different aminos in the main chains of residues Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145 of nCoV-2019 protease.

            "The current pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (CoV), called 2019-nCoV in China, has evolved into a global health emergency declared by the World Health Organization. Although there is no effective anti-viral medicine for the 2019-nCoV, the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have a sequence identity of 96%, which provides a foundation for us to hypothesize that all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also effective anti-2019-CoV molecules. We build a three-dimensional (3D) 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure using a SARS-CoV 3CL protease crystal structure as a template and collect a set of 84 SARS-CoV inhibition experimental data. The molecules of this set are docked to the 3D 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure to form a machine learning training set. Additionally, the PDBbind 2018 general set of 15,843 protein-ligand complexes is also included as an additional machine learning training set. Using these training sets, we develop two deep learning models based on low-dimensional algebraic topology representations of macromolecular complexes. A total of 1465 FDA-approved drugs is evaluated by their binding affinities predicted by the consensus of two models built with 1) a combination of algebraic topology and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and 2) a combination of algebraic topology and deep multitask CNNs. According to the predicted binding affinities, we recommend many FDA-approved drugs as potentially highly potent medications to 2019-nCoV, which serve as a crucial step for the development of anti-2019-nCoV drugs."

A more effective approach is to search for anti-2019-nCoV therapies from the existing FDA-approved drug database.",
            "Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing), which concerns the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic target indications, has emerged as a successful strategy for drug discovery due to the reduced costs and expedited approval procedures [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. Several successful examples unveil its great values in practice: Nelfinavir, initially developed to treat the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is now being used for cancer treatments. Amantadine was firstly designed to treat influenza caused by type A influenza viral infection and is being used for Parkinson\u2019s disease later on [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>]. In recent years, the rapid growth of drug-related datasets, as well as open data initiatives, has led to new developments for computational drug repositioning, particularly, structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Machine learning, network analysis, and text mining and semantic inference are three major computational approaches commonly applied in drug repositioning [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>]. The rapid accumulation of genetic and structural databases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>], the development of low-dimensional mathematical representations of complex biomolecular structures [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>], and the availability of advanced deep learning algorithms have made machine learning-based drug reposition a promising approach [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c7\" href=\"#r7\">7</a>].

Algebraic graph theory-based algorithms [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c25\" href=\"#r25\">25</a>], differential geometry, and algebraic topology methods [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] are applied to generate three mathematical representations of data in MathDL. These data representations can be integrated with well-designed deep learning models, such as gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for pose ranking and binding affinity predictions. In D3R Grand Challenges (https://drugdesigndata.org/about/grand-challenge), a worldwide competition series in computer-aided drug design, MathDL had been proved as the top performer in free energy prediction and ranking [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>].

The PDBbind 2018 general set [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], along with the SARS 3CL protease related dataset is used in our training process. In this section, we briefly describe the algebraic topology representation used in the present work. Details can be found in the literature [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>]. 4.5.1 Algebraic topology-based representation Even with a glimpse of topology, one can realize it dramatically simplifies geometric complexity [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>\u2013 <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>]. The study of topology reveals characterizes of different dimensions. As a type of algebraic topology, simplicial homology studies complexes on discrete datasets under various settings, such as the VietorisRips (VR) complex, Cech complex or alpha complex, and identifies the topological invariants of a pointcloud dataset such as atomic coordinates in a protein [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c26\" href=\"#r26\">26</a>]. Separated components, rings, and cavities can be classified for a given configuration and their numbers are referred to as Betti-0, Betti-1, and Betti-2, respectively. In this topological analysis process, the metrics or coordinates are fully abandoned. Instead, geometric and topological information is captured as data representation. Moreover, as a new development branch of algebraic topology, persistent homology which combines multiscale geometric information and topological invariants to achieve a geometry-enriched topological characteristic, e.g., barcodes. Therefore, the \u201cbirth\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d of separated components, circles, rings, voids or cavities can be indicated at all spatial scales by topological measurements. Key concepts are briefly shown as following.",
            "In algebraic topology, simplices are the essential building blocks. Let v0, v1, v2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vk be k +1 affinely independent points. A (geometric) k-simplex \u03c3k is the linear combinations of these points in Rn (n \u2265 k), whose coefficients are positive and satisfy that their summation equals to 1.

            "K and the non-empty intersection of any two simplices is a face for both. To identify the homology group, a k-chain [\u03c3k] is a summation i \u03b1i\u03c3ik of k-simplices \u03c3ik, and the set of all k-chains of the simplicial complex K equipped with an algebraic field (typically, Z2) forms an abelian group Ck(K, Z2). The homology defined on a series of abelian groups is used to analyze topological invariants which requires boundary operators to connect these chain spaces. The boundary operators \u2202k : Ck \u2192 Ck\u22121 for a k-simplex \u03c3k = {v0, v1, v2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vk} are homomorphisms defined as \u2202k\u03c3k = ki=0(\u22121)i{v0, v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vi, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vk}, where {v0, v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vi, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vk} is a (k \u2212 1)-simplex excluding vi from the vertex set. Consequently, a important property of boundary operator, \u2202k\u22121\u2202k = \u2205, follows from that boundaries are boundaryless.

            "The current pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (CoV), called 2019-nCoV in China, has evolved into a global health emergency declared by the World Health Organization. Although there is no effective anti-viral medicine for the 2019-nCoV, the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV have a sequence identity of 96%, which provides a foundation for us to hypothesize that all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also effective anti-2019-CoV molecules. We build a three-dimensional (3D) 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure using a SARS-CoV 3CL protease crystal structure as a template and collect a set of 84 SARS-CoV inhibition experimental data. The molecules of this set are docked to the 3D 2019-nCoV 3CL protease structure to form a machine learning training set. Additionally, the PDBbind 2018 general set of 15,843 protein-ligand complexes is also included as an additional machine learning training set. Using these training sets, we develop two deep learning models based on low-dimensional algebraic topology representations of macromolecular complexes. A total of 1465 FDA-approved drugs is evaluated by their binding affinities predicted by the consensus of two models built with 1) a combination of algebraic topology and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and 2) a combination of algebraic topology and deep multitask CNNs. According to the predicted binding affinities, we recommend many FDA-approved drugs as potentially highly potent medications to 2019-nCoV, which serve as a crucial step for the development of anti-2019-nCoV drugs."
