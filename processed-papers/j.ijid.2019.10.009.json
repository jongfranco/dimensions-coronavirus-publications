        "abstract": "Background: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important pathogens that cause acute respiratory infections in children and immunocompromised adults. This work was conducted to understand the epidemiological and phylogenetic features of RSV in southern China during 2011\u20132016. Methods: A total of 16 024 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory infections in 14 hospitals, and screened for RSV and seven other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Six hundred and twenty-three RSV-positive samples from 13 hospitals were further analyzed for subtypes. G gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed based on 46 RSV-A and 15 RSV-B strains. Results: RSV was detected in 9.5% of the 16 024 specimens, the highest among the eight respiratory viruses screened. Most of these specimens came from inpatients and children under 3 years of age. The incidence of RSV-A (9.4%) was higher than that of RSV-B (4.4%) in children (<15 years), but not in adults (0.64% vs. 0.58%). A 2-year RSV-A dominance followed by a 1-year RSV-B dominance pattern was found. The co-detection rate of RSV was 25.1%. The main prevalent genotypes were NA1, ON1, and BA9. The prevalent RSV-A genotype in 2011\u20132012 was NA1, close to Chongqing and Brazil, but a new Hong Kong ON1 genotype was introduced and became the prevalent genotype in Guangzhou in 2014\u20132015. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis confirmed the ongoing evolution and a high selection pressure of RSV-A and B strains, especially in RSV-A ON1 and NA1 genotypes. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV in patients with respiratory infections in southern China. ",

            "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important pathogens that cause acute respiratory infections in children and immunocompromised adults. This work was conducted to understand the epidemiological and phylogenetic features of RSV in southern China during 2011\u20132016. Methods: A total of 16 024 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory infections in 14 hospitals, and screened for RSV and seven other respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Six hundred and twenty-three RSV-positive samples from 13 hospitals were further analyzed for subtypes. G gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed based on 46 RSV-A and 15 RSV-B strains. Results: RSV was detected in 9.5% of the 16 024 specimens, the highest among the eight respiratory viruses screened. Most of these specimens came from inpatients and children under 3 years of age. The incidence of RSV-A (9.4%) was higher than that of RSV-B (4.4%) in children (<15 years), but not in adults (0.64% vs. 0.58%). A 2-year RSV-A dominance followed by a 1-year RSV-B dominance pattern was found. The co-detection rate of RSV was 25.1%. The main prevalent genotypes were NA1, ON1, and BA9. The prevalent RSV-A genotype in 2011\u20132012 was NA1, close to Chongqing and Brazil, but a new Hong Kong ON1 genotype was introduced and became the prevalent genotype in Guangzhou in 2014\u20132015. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis confirmed the ongoing evolution and a high selection pressure of RSV-A and B strains, especially in RSV-A ON1 and NA1 genotypes. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV in patients with respiratory infections in southern China. \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, RSV-related respiratory tract infection is a major public health issue worldwide.<br/><br/>The clinical manifestations after RSV infection range from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe life-threatening lower respiratory tract involvement such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup, together with some common symptoms including fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and wheezing (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBorchers_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rBorchers_et+al_2013_a\">Borchers et al, 2013</a>), which are not readily distinguished from those of other common respiratory virus infections. Although efforts to develop an RSV vaccine for all age groups began in the 1960s, no safe and effective vaccine is yet available, and antiviral treatment for RSV infection is currently also very limited, with treatments usually being supportive and symptomatic (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cColosia_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rColosia_et+al_2017_a\"><a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cColosia_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rColosia_et+al_2017_a\">Colosia et al, 2017</a></a>).<br/><br/>Although RSV has only one single serotype, it can be divided into two antigenic groups \u2013 RSV-A and RSV-B \u2013 according to the antigenicity of the G protein (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cMufson_et+al_1985_a\" href=\"#rMufson_et+al_1985_a\">Mufson et al, 1985</a>).

However, data concerning the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV subtypes are limited, and there are few reports about the epidemiological status and genotypic characteristics of RSV prevailing in patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) in southern China (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rLiu_et+al_2016_a\">Liu et al, 2016</a>). This study was, therefore, performed to investigate the presence of RSV in pediatric (<15 years) and adult (!15 years) patients with ARI in Guangzhou. Specimens were collected from ARI patients during 2011\u20132016 and RSV was analyzed along with seven other common respiratory viruses. A phylogenetic analysis of RSV-A and RSV-B strains was performed in order to better understand the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV circulating in southern China."

            "RSV is one of the most common pathogens that cause ALRI, especially in young children (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cShi_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rShi_et+al_2017_a\">Shi et al, 2017</a>). Since there is no specific drug and no effective vaccine for RSV infection, the long-term monitoring of RSV is important for RSV prevention and control \u2013 by continuously collecting and analyzing data related to RSV introduction, transmission, distribution, and variation, and by understanding more about RSV epidemic and variation patterns, we can predict the prevalent level and scale of RSV and help to produce control and prevention strategies. This study investigated the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV and its subtypes in ARI patients during 2011\u20132016 in Guangzhou, southern China. Since RSV usually co-infects with other respiratory viruses, seven common respiratory viruses including Flu, PIV, HCoV, HADV, HBoV, HMPV, and HRV were detected simultaneously.<br/><br/>The results showed that among the eight common respiratory viruses, RSV was the one most commonly detected, with a detection rate of 9.5% in 16 024 patients with ARI from 14 hospitals during 2011\u20132016 in southern China. Flu was the second most frequently detected respiratory virus (9.3%). The age characteristics and monthly distribution of RSV and the seven respiratory viruses in Guangzhou during 2011\u20132016 were consistent with those in previous reports (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rLiu_et+al_2014_a\">Liu et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhang_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rZhang_et+al_2014_a\">Zhang et al, 2014</a>). A total of 1514 patients were RSV-positive, 91.7% of whom were inpatients, significantly higher than outpatients (p < 0.01). The odds ratio of hospitalized patients with RSV infection to outpatient/emergency was 4.14, indicating that RSV infection has a considerable risk of resulting in severe disease. Infants and toddlers (<3 years) not in nursery (59.5%) seemed to have the highest risk of RSV infection, and the reason may lie in the decrease in maternal protective antibodies and the increase in exposure opportunities to crowds. The monthly distribution confirmed that RSV was mainly prevalent in winter and spring, consistent with other regions (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBashir_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rBashir_et+al_2017_a\">Bashir et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSlovic_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rSlovic_et+al_2016_a\">Slovic et al, 2016</a>). The annual distribution of RSV during 2011\u20132016 in Guangzhou revealed high epidemic years for 2011, 2014, and 2015, with year 2015 as an epidemic peak. There may be a biennial high incidence pattern of RSV in Guangzhou, and surveillance over a longer period will confirm the annual distribution characteristics (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cEsposito_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rEsposito_et+al_2015_a\">Esposito et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cXiang_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rXiang_et+al_2013_a\">Xiang et al, 2013</a>)."

In contrast, RSV-B was predominant in 2013 and 2016 (Chi-square = 168.19, p < 0.01; Figure 3E), when RSV-A circulated at a low level. There was an interesting RSV year distribution trend, with RSV-A dominant in 2011 and 2012, followed by RSV-B dominant in 2013, and then RSV-A dominant in 2014 and 2015, followed by RSV-B dominant in 2016 (Figure 3B), showing a 2-year RSV-A and 1-year RSV-B dominant pattern.",

RSV-A was the predominant subtype in most of the months except July, when RSV-B slightly exceeded (Figure 4C). On analysis of the detailed monthly distribution for 2011\u20132016 (Figure 5), it was found that most of the time, RSV-A and RSV-B had dominance alternately, except for January to June in 2014, when both RSV-A and RSV-B were epidemic at a high level.",

            "Phylogenetic analysis showed that among the 46 Guangzhou RSV-A strains, there were 29 genotype NA1, 15 genotype ON1, one genotype NA3, and one genotype GA5 (Figures 6 and 7). The 29 NA1 strains included 24 strains from 2011 and five strains from 2012. Among these, 25 were close to Chongqing NA1 strain GU550471, and the remaining four strains were in another cluster, closer to the Brazil strain JX513285. The 15 ON1 strains included eight 2015strains, five 2014 strains, one 2012 strain, and one 2013 strain, and all of them were close to Hong Kong ON1 strain",

All 15 Guangzhou strains of RSV-B belonged to the BA9 genotype and were close to Chengdu strain KT765074. Therefore, the main genotypes of RSV-A circulating in Guangzhou from 2011 to 2015 were NA1 and ON1, whereas the prevalent RSV-B genotype was BA9. Moreover, the dominant RSV-A genotype in 2011\u20132012 was NA1, but ON1 became the dominant genotype in 2014\u20132015 (Figure 6).",

The loss of a 24-amino acid fragment in the duplication region of ON1 genotype was observed in three Guangzhou strains (GZ/2014/03, GZ/2014/ 04, and GZ/2015/43). GZ/2014/03 and GZ/2014/04 lost amino acids 261\u2013284 (i.e., QEETLHSTTSEGYLSPSQVYTTSG) and GZ/2015/43 showed a shift of two amino acids and lost amino acids 263\u2013 286 (i.e., ETLHSTTSEGYLSPSQVYTTSGQE). Compared to the A2 prototype, ON1 subtype-specific substitutions (S222P, T253K, and S314L) were observed in all of the ON1 subtypes, and E232G was observed in most of the ON1 strains except GZ/2014/05. M286E, P310L, and S314P were observed in all NA1 strains. Other commonly observed substitutions for RSV-A strains included L208I, P215S, S222P, N237D/Y, T249I, N251Y, E262K, N297Y, P298L, and P320T. There were two deletions (L265 and E308) observed in GZ/2015/16. The analysis of potential N-glycosylation sites revealed that due to the N237Y substitution of ON1 and NA3 genotype, GZ/2015/16 and GZ/2015/10 lost potential N-glycosylation sites at residue 237, but interestingly, due to the D237N substitution, 10 Guangzhou NA1 strains regained this N-glycosylation site. Moreover, due to N318Y, T319A, or T320S/I/P mutation, eight Guangzhou NA1 and one Guangzhou NA3 strains lost the potential N-glycosylation site at residue 318 (Figure 8).

        "Discussion": [
            "RSV is one of the most common pathogens that cause ALRI, especially in young children (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cShi_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rShi_et+al_2017_a\">Shi et al, 2017</a>). Since there is no specific drug and no effective vaccine for RSV infection, the long-term monitoring of RSV is important for RSV prevention and control \u2013 by continuously collecting and analyzing data related to RSV introduction, transmission, distribution, and variation, and by understanding more about RSV epidemic and variation patterns, we can predict the prevalent level and scale of RSV and help to produce control and prevention strategies. This study investigated the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV and its subtypes in ARI patients during 2011\u20132016 in Guangzhou, southern China. Since RSV usually co-infects with other respiratory viruses, seven common respiratory viruses including Flu, PIV, HCoV, HADV, HBoV, HMPV, and HRV were detected simultaneously.",
            "The results showed that among the eight common respiratory viruses, RSV was the one most commonly detected, with a detection rate of 9.5% in 16 024 patients with ARI from 14 hospitals during 2011\u20132016 in southern China. Flu was the second most frequently detected respiratory virus (9.3%). The age characteristics and monthly distribution of RSV and the seven respiratory viruses in Guangzhou during 2011\u20132016 were consistent with those in previous reports (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cLiu_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rLiu_et+al_2014_a\">Liu et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZhang_et+al_2014_a\" href=\"#rZhang_et+al_2014_a\">Zhang et al, 2014</a>). A total of 1514 patients were RSV-positive, 91.7% of whom were inpatients, significantly higher than outpatients (p < 0.01). The odds ratio of hospitalized patients with RSV infection to outpatient/emergency was 4.14, indicating that RSV infection has a considerable risk of resulting in severe disease. Infants and toddlers (<3 years) not in nursery (59.5%) seemed to have the highest risk of RSV infection, and the reason may lie in the decrease in maternal protective antibodies and the increase in exposure opportunities to crowds. The monthly distribution confirmed that RSV was mainly prevalent in winter and spring, consistent with other regions (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cBashir_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rBashir_et+al_2017_a\">Bashir et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSlovic_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rSlovic_et+al_2016_a\">Slovic et al, 2016</a>). The annual distribution of RSV during 2011\u20132016 in Guangzhou revealed high epidemic years for 2011, 2014, and 2015, with year 2015 as an epidemic peak. There may be a biennial high incidence pattern of RSV in Guangzhou, and surveillance over a longer period will confirm the annual distribution characteristics (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cEsposito_et+al_2015_a\" href=\"#rEsposito_et+al_2015_a\">Esposito et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cXiang_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rXiang_et+al_2013_a\">Xiang et al, 2013</a>).",
            "To better understand the epidemiological characteristics of RSV subtypes, RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes were determined based on 623 RSV-positive samples from 13 hospitals. The results showed that RSV-A was the dominant subtype circulating in Guangzhou during 2011\u20132016, consistent with reports from other regions (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cHu_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rHu_et+al_2017_a\">Hu et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSlovic_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rSlovic_et+al_2016_a\">Slovic et al, 2016</a>). The three patients with co-detection were all infants and toddlers and inpatients with ALRI, and none of them died. It cannot be deduced whether the co-detection of both subtypes exacerbates the disease based on the symptoms. Both RSV-A and RSV-B mainly infected young children under 3 years of age, and the incidence of RSV-A was higher than that of RSV-B in children (p < 0.01), but not in adults (p > 0.05), indicating that RSV-A may have a higher pathogenicity to children.",
            "The annual distribution of RSV subtypes revealed an interesting year distribution, as a 2-year RSV-A dominance followed by a 1-year RSV-B dominance pattern was found. A similar year distribution pattern has been reported previously in Beijing and Belgium, among others (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cXiang_et+al_2013_a\" href=\"#rXiang_et+al_2013_a\">Xiang et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCoggins_et+al_1998_a\" href=\"#rCoggins_et+al_1998_a\">Coggins et al, 1998</a>; <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cZlateva_et+al_2007_a\" href=\"#rZlateva_et+al_2007_a\">Zlateva et al, 2007</a>; Scott et al, 2004). In addition to this pattern, RSV-A has been reported to show an epidemic for 2\u20134 years followed by RSV-B for 1 year pattern, as reported in Uruguay (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cArbiza_et+al_2005_a\" href=\"#rArbiza_et+al_2005_a\">Arbiza et al, 2005</a>); and also, an RSV-A epidemic for 4 years followed by RSV-B for 1 year pattern, as reported in Japan (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cShobugawa_et+al_2009_a\" href=\"#rShobugawa_et+al_2009_a\">Shobugawa et al, 2009</a>). It appears that this is the first time such a year distribution characteristic of RSV subtypes has been reported for Guangzhou. Most of the time, RSV-A and RSV-B took dominance alternately, but in January to June 2014, both RSV-A and RSV-B were epidemic at a high level. The co-detection rate of RSV was as high as 25.1% in Guangzhou from 2011 to 2016, and 91.1% of them were double infections and 8.9% were triple infections.",
            "Influenza virus was the most common co-detected virus. No correlation was found between clinical symptoms and co-detection (p > 0.05), indicating that co-detection may not aggravate the disease or enhance the mortality of patients. However, this finding may be limited by the small sample size and the heterogeneity of co-detected viruses, and more studies will be needed to elucidate the relationships between RSV co-infection and disease severity.",
            "The genome of RSV encodes 11 proteins, including NS1, NS2, N, P, M, SH, G, F, M2-1, M2-2, and L (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cCane_2001_a\" href=\"#rCane_2001_a\">Cane, 2001</a>). According to the genetic diversity, RSV is genotyped mainly by the second highvariant region of the G protein C-terminal (HVR2) (<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cSchobel_et+al_2016_a\" href=\"#rSchobel_et+al_2016_a\">Schobel et al, 2016</a>). Therefore, to better understand the phylogenetic characteristics of RSV in southern China and to gain more insight into RSV variation, we further analyzed the sequences of the G genes of the Guangzhou RSV strains. Most of the RSV-A genotypes from Guangzhou were close to Chongqing and Hong Kong strains and the RSV-B was close to a Chengdu strain. The prevalent RSV-B",
            "genotype in Guangzhou during 2011\u20132016 was BA9, whereas the prevalent RSV-A genotypes were more diverse. Among the 30 strains from the years 2011\u20132012, 29 were NA1 and one was ON1. Among the 15 strains from the years 2014\u20132015, 13 were ON1 and the other two were GA5 and BA9, respectively. The 2013 strain belonged to ON1. It can be seen that the NA1 genotype of RSV-A was prevalent in 2011\u20132012, while ON1 became the prevalent genotype in 2014\u20132015, which is consistent with the report of <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"cFan_et+al_2017_a\" href=\"#rFan_et+al_2017_a\">Fan et al (2017</a>).",
            "Deduced amino acid sequence analysis confirmed the ongoing evolution of RSV-A and B strains, especially in RSV-A ON1 and NA1 genotypes. Multiple highly variable substitutions were observed, and moreover, three Guangzhou ON1 strains showed the loss of a 24-amino acid fragment in the duplication region, and one BA9 strain had a 20-amino acid deletion. N-glycosylation site changes were also commonly observed in Guangzhou RSV-A strains, including the loss of the 251 and 318 glycosylation sites and regain of the 237 glycosylation site in most of the NA1 strains, and the loss of the 237 glycosylation site and two single amino acid deletions in an ON1 strain GZ/2015/16. Glycosylation site changes were also observed in three RSV-B BA9 strains. These mutations indicated a high selection pressure.",
            "Since 2014\u20132015 was also the highest epidemic year for RSV-A, it was deduced that before 2012, the prevalent RSV genotype was NA1 from Chongqing, but in 2014, due to staff turnover, a new Hong Kong strain of ON1 genotype was introduced (Song et al, 2017), evolved, and became the dominant strain. Furthermore, because the population lacked antibody protection, the new genotype spread rapidly and caused the high incidence of RSV-A in 2014\u20132015 in Guangzhou. Combined with the monthly distribution by site, we believe that the epidemic peaks in Zhu Jiang Hospital and Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases in 2014 reflected the prevalence of the new genotype. Although Zou et al (2016) also investigated the evolution and transmission of RSV-A in Guangdong in 2008\u20132015, the present study is the first to report the introduction, evolution, and transmission of the new ON1 genotype in Guangzhou, southern China. Further studies should be conducted to reveal the mechanisms behind the emergence of new genotypes and RSV epidemic.",
            "In conclusion, this study investigated the molecular epidemiological characteristics of RSV and its genotypes in children and adult patients with ARI in southern China during 2011\u20132016. The findings may have significance in guiding policy-making for RSV prevention and control, and may provide important information for RSV variation studies."

        "The annual distribution trend for RSV-A was similar to that of the total RSV, with epidemic peaks in 2011 and 2014\u20132015 (Chi-square = 194.03, p < 0.01; Figure 3D)",
        "RSV-B was predominant in 2013 and 2016 (Chi-square = 168.19, p < 0.01; Figure 3E), when RSV-A circulated at a low level",
        "The co-detection rate in females was 28.6% (136/ 475), which was higher than the rate of 23.5% in males (244/1039, Chi-square = 4.59, p < 0.05)",
        "A total of 1514 patients were RSV-positive, 91.7% of whom were inpatients, significantly higher than outpatients (p < 0.01)",
        "The three patients with co-detection were all infants and toddlers and inpatients with ALRI, and none of them died. It cannot be deduced whether the co-detection of both subtypes exacerbates the disease based on the symptoms. Both RSV-A and RSV-B mainly infected young children under 3 years of age, and the incidence of RSV-A was higher than that of RSV-B in children (p < 0.01), but not in adults (p > 0.05), indicating that RSV-A may have a higher pathogenicity to children"
