        "abstract": "The epidemic of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) near Wuhan City and the surrounding Hubei Province in China has received extensive news coverage. Some have predicted the virus will cause a worldwide pandemic (1). The CDC has an extensive website discussing over numerous pages whom to suspect, how to diagnose and how to treat 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCoV represents the most recent of the severe coronaviral infections. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are also caused by coronaviruses that have jumped from animals to humans like 2019-nCoV. It should be remembered that there are only 12 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in the US and the mortality rate appears to be only about 3% which is lower than SARS or MERS (2,3). This could be offset by a greater infectiousness of 2019nCoV resulting in more aggregate infectious, and hence, deaths.",
