Cases were found in several bordering regions and autonomous provinces of northern Italy.",
            "This chain of events shows how preparedness and containment can be hampered in decentralised countries such as Italy. On 24 February, the Italian prime minister threatened to take back powers from the regions and autonomous provinces because they were \u201cin charge of implementing healthcare but not prepared to face a national emergency.\u201d He complained about mismanagement of patient 1, with incorrect application of (unspecified) protocols that \u201ccertainly contributed to the spread,\u201d[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] and inconsistent measures deployed by the regions and provinces such as quarantine, school closure, cancellation of social events, and limited commercial hours.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] Governors pushed back against the criticism, declaring it \u201cunacceptable, as hospitals were facing hardship and had complied with national guidelines\u2014at the cost of slowing down operations\u2014despite their legal autonomy.\u201d[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]",
            "Two key elements of the Italian experience are particularly notable. Firstly, decentralisation can help \u201cpreparedness by design\u201d only if plans are shared across all levels of governance. Regional health services in Italy are heterogeneous in terms of governance, providers, procedures, and performance,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] but there is a large variation even within regions.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] In Lombardy, for example, urban areas are surrounded by rural communities, where hospitals have lower volumes of activity, fewer resources, and staff have stronger links with patients they serve. All these factors may create gaps in containment procedures.",
            "The solution, rather than recentralisation, is better integration of decentralised competence. During an outbreak, regional authorities can actively slow the spread of infection, as countries do with their borders. At the same time, the highest level of interoperability between regions and the centre is essential. In the Italian outbreak, this was challenged by the location of case clusters across bordering regions with strong autonomy.",
            "A second critical point is the need for efficient exchange of data across all borders. During outbreaks, authorities need to trace contacts and track people\u2019s movements, healthcare providers must identify high risk cases, and researchers need to investigate treatment efficacy, prognostic patterns and the outbreak\u2019s epidemiological trajectory. The Italian experience shows that the accurate and timely information required by all these parties is insufficient, even when health information infrastructure is optimal.",
            "Italy\u2019s system is perfectly designed to enable population based surveillance: each citizen has a personal ID (corresponding to the tax file number) linked to a unique general practitioner, local healthcare authority, and region or autonomous province. All services use citizen ID to link records stored in databases held by local health authorities to optimise healthcare. However, regions and autonomous provinces normally have access only to periodic extracts of these databases, and the ministry of health receives only subsets of these data, after a substantial delay and with limited capabilities for data linkage.",
            "empowered to reconcile essential levels of health information across the country.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]",
            "Decentralisation can help outbreak preparedness only when governing bodies agree to full data sharing and accept both public scrutiny and evaluation by an independent authority. Sustainability of this model can be guaranteed only when such infrastructure operates for multiple purposes, to compare and improve performance at all levels of governance (central, regional, and local) and healthcare (primary, secondary, and tertiary care).[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]",
            "Under these favourable conditions, specific tasks such as the hunt for patient 0\u2014a national priority that seems still unsuccessful\u2014can be facilitated by using an already rich information base. The hunt probably never deserved such attention: a few days before patient 1 was diagnosed, cases of an unidentified but severe pulmonary disease were noted in the same area.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] Furthermore, the couple from Wuhan had reportedly driven to Rome through the regions where cases emerged three weeks later.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] It\u2019s epidemiologically possible that either of them could have been patient 0. In which case, a couple of visitors flying from the primary origin of the disease are the most sensible explanation for the growing outbreak of covid-19 in Italy.",
