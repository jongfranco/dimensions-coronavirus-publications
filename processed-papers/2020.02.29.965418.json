        "abstract": "In this work, we use a within-host viral dynamic model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host. Chest radiograph score data are used to estimate the parameters of that model. Our result shows that the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 in host growth is around 3.79. Using the same method we also estimate the basic reproductive number of MERS virus is 8.16 which is higher than SARS-CoV-2. The PRCC method is used to analyze the sensitivities of model parameters and the drug effects on virus growth are also implemented to analyze the model.",

            "Based on the chest radiograph data, we estimate the parameters and basic reproductive number of the model (1). The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in host growth is 3.79, which is higher than HCV (2.3, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]), but lower than the flu virus (23, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]). Comparing the estimated parameters of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS coronavirus, the MERS have a higher virulence to infect the pulmonary epithelial cells (larger R0) and with a small initial value of infected cell. These may esplain why the MERS have a higher mortality and smaller incubation period [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. By the PRCC method, the sensitivity analysis is also done on the R0, and the positive correlation of Ep(0) with R0 may give a possible reason why the baby patients are less likely to die of this virus. We also analyze the drug therapy and its effect on the virus growth, and the result illustrates that early medication is effective for treatment."

        "limitations": [
            "The major limitation of this study is that the chest radiograph score is not the real data of the infected pulmonary epithelial cells but just an approximation. Moreover, we assume that the immunne effect on viruses and infected epithelial cells are constant values. This is because the data of antibody and effective CD8 cells of that virus are rarely known. If we could get more accurate data, the results will be much better."

All of these works focus on population dynamics of COVID-19, while, the works about the viral dynamics in host are rare. In this work, we use the within-host viral dynamic model [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host and the parameters of that model are estimated via the chest radiograph score. Moreover, using the CT score data of MERS that shown in Oh et. al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], the paramters of MERS virus are also estimated as a comparision group. All of the results are shown in the third section."

The death rate of Ep(t) is the natural clearance rate of pulmonary epithelial cells, while, dE\u2217 and dv are the combination of the natural clearance rate and elimination by the immunity system. This model was also used to describe the within-lung infection process of flu virus [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].",

This result shows the immune system can clear the virus directly. The estimation result also shows that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in serve patients is around the mean value 3.79 which is lower than that of MERS virus (8.16). These results illustrate that the immune system can not clear the virus effectively at the beginning time of symptom onset. By these estimated parameters of COVID-19, the solutions of model (1) are illustrated in Figure .2.",

Parameters dE\u2217 , and dv have negative correlations with R0, while Ep(0), \u03b2, \u03c0v have positive correlations.

        "4 Discussion": [
            "Based on the chest radiograph data, we estimate the parameters and basic reproductive number of the model (1). The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in host growth is 3.79, which is higher than HCV (2.3, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]), but lower than the flu virus (23, [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>]). Comparing the estimated parameters of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS coronavirus, the MERS have a higher virulence to infect the pulmonary epithelial cells (larger R0) and with a small initial value of infected cell. These may esplain why the MERS have a higher mortality and smaller incubation period [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]. By the PRCC method, the sensitivity analysis is also done on the R0, and the positive correlation of Ep(0) with R0 may give a possible reason why the baby patients are less likely to die of this virus. We also analyze the drug therapy and its effect on the virus growth, and the result illustrates that early medication is effective for treatment.",
            "The methods we used in this study are following the previous works by Miao et. al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>,<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>]. This is the first time for this methodology to be used in the COVID-19 and our work shows some new results of the within-host properties of this virus. All of the source codes are available at the GitHub (https: //github.com/ChentongLi/SARS-CoV-2_viral_kinetic). Anyone could use these codes to estimate and forecast the chest radiograph score of the patients.",
            "The major limitation of this study is that the chest radiograph score is not the real data of the infected pulmonary epithelial cells but just an approximation. Moreover, we assume that the immunne effect on viruses and infected epithelial cells are constant values. This is because the data of antibody and effective CD8 cells of that virus are rarely known. If we could get more accurate data, the results will be much better.",
            "We believe this study could give some help to the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19. For other disease that infect the lung, this method we believe also could be used to do analysis."
