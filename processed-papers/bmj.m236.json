            "\u201cIt is clear that at least some human to human transmission exists from the evidence we have, but we don\u2019t have clear evidence that shows the virus has the capacity to transmit among humans easily,\u201d said Takeshi Kasai, the World Health Organization\u2019s regional director for the Western Pacific, in an interview with Bloomberg.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>] He added, \u201cFor us to analyse the full extent of human to human transmission, we need some more information \u201cAs of today, a team of WHO staff is now in Wuhan to visit the important area and meet the experts and officials and to observe the outbreak. It is a new disease, and there are still many things we do not know and therefore we have to be very vigilant so we can assess the full extent of the disease.\u201d",
            "In Wuhan 170 people were still being treated in hospital, nine of whom were in critical condition, and the infection has been confirmed in 62 cases in the city.",
            "Four cases have also been detected overseas.",
            "On 20 January South Korea announced its first confirmed case, in a 35 year old Chinese woman who flew from Wuhan to Incheon international airport on Sunday and who was isolated on entry into the country because of her symptoms, including high fever.",
            "On 15 January Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health announced that a Japanese man in his 30s who had been to Wuhan tested positive for the virus on his return to Japan. He recovered and was discharged from hospital five days later.",
            "On 13 January Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Public Health reported that a 61 year old woman had tested positive for the virus. She had not visited the South China Seafood Wholesale Market where the outbreak is thought to have originated, but she had visited a different market where live animals may have been on sale. Four days later the Thai ministry announced that a 74 year old Chinese woman had been quarantined on arrival in the country and had tested positive.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>]",
            "Ports of entry around the region, including in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Taiwan, and Thailand, have stepped up surveillance measures, such as health declaration forms and temperature monitoring of incoming passengers arriving from Wuhan. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident that we can control the spread of this kind of disease,\u201d Thailand\u2019s health minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, told Reuters.5 \u201cWe\u2019re fully alert.\u201d",
            "However, there are concerns of an increased risk of the virus spreading domestically and overseas now that the mass movement of people is under way because of holidays. Hundreds of millions of migrant workers in China head home for the lunar new year holiday, and Chinese tourists head to neighbouring countries during the holiday period. Reuters reported that Thailand\u2019s tourism council expects around 800 000 visitors from China over the lunar new year holiday, which starts on 25 January.",
            "\u201cI would not be surprised if there were more cases being exported to overseas countries or even entering Hong Kong,\u201d said David S C Hui, chairman of the department of medicine and therapeutics and a professor of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s Faculty of Medicine. \u201cI think the current measures in Hong Kong are actually quite practical. Screening of temperature on arrival is one of the important steps. Of course, if there are more cases being confirmed in other provinces in the mainland of China then we have to be even more careful, screening all visitors and travellers from the mainland to Hong Kong,\u201d he added.",
            "The number of reported cases is so far well below the estimated potential number of cases, researchers at Imperial College London have said.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>] On the basis of the size of Wuhan International Airport\u2019s catchment population of 19 million, an estimated 10 day delay between infection and detection, and passenger volumes over the past two months, the researchers estimated that 1723 people (95% confidence interval 427 to 4471) should have showed onset of symptoms by 12 January, which was the last reported date of onset of any case.",
            "Sequencing data for the 2019-nCOV virus were released on 10 January, and by 16 January a laboratory assay had been developed by researchers at the German Centre for Infection Research at the Charit\u00e9 university hospital in Berlin.7 \u201cNow that this diagnostic test is widely available, I expect it won\u2019t be long before we are able to reliably diagnose suspected cases. This will also help scientists understand whether the virus is capable of spreading from human to human,\u201d said Christian Drosten, director of the hospital\u2019s institute of virology, in a statement.",
            "However, many unanswered questions about the new coronavirus remain, including the identity of the specific animal sources and other reservoirs of the virus, its transmission route, and the incubation period. In an editorial in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, David Hui of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and colleagues wrote, \u201cAt present, there is however very limited clinical information of the 2019-nCoV infection and data are missing in regard to the age range, animal source of the virus, incubation period, epidemic curve, viral kinetics, transmission route, pathogenesis, autopsy findings and any treatment response to antivirals among the severe cases.\u201d[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c8\" href=\"#r8\">8</a>]",
