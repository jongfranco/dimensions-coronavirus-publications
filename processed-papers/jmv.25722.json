On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV). On 11 February 2020, the WHO officially named the disease caused by the 2019\u2010nCoV as coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019). The COVID\u201019 epidemic is spreading all over the world, especially in China. Based on the published evidence, we systematically discuss the characteristics of COVID\u201019 in the hope of providing a reference for future studies and help for the prevention and control of the COVID\u201019 epidemic.",

            "Regarding the case fatality and transmission rates among patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, the findings from various studies were different. The studies of Wang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] showed that the case fatality rate was 2.84%. According to Huang et al,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] the number was 15%. The study by Wu et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] estimated that the case fatality rate was 14%. In the study by Zhu et al,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] the number was 33%. Guan et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] reported that the case fatality rate was 1.36%. According to the official data released by China, the case fatality of COVID\u201019 patients was 3.17%.2 In terms of the transmission rate, Li et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] showed that the transmission rate was 2.2 per patient. Wu et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] estimated that the transmission rate was 0.3 per patient. Yang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] reported that the transmission rate was 3.77. We think that the transmission rate of 2.2 per patient seems to be more in line with the current situation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] Different sample sizes and possible viral variations may have contributed to the differences between the studies. Studies with a larger sample size may give a better estimation of the case fatality rate and transmission rate of the COVID\u201019. We know that the other two major zoonotic coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS which caused widespread transmission have case fatality rates of 9.6% and 35%, respectively.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] According to the official Chinese data, the case fatality rate among the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients was much lower than that of SARS and MERS.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]"

            "Since December 2019, there has been a series of unexplained cases of pneumonia reported in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government and researchers took rapid measures to control the epidemic and carried out etiological research.

            "Since December 2019, there has been a series of unexplained cases of pneumonia reported in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government and researchers took rapid measures to control the epidemic and carried out etiological research. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively named this new virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV). On 30 January 2020, WHO announced the 2019\u2010nCoV epidemic a public health emergency of international concern.

Recently, Zhou et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>] and Wu et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>] found that the sequence homology between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV was 79.5%. They also found that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 had high homology with bat coronaviruses. Therefore, the current evidence strongly supports that the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was derived from bats, although the intermediate hosts of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 remain to be determined.",
            "A study by Wang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] showed that from January 10 to 24, 2020, the number of people diagnosed with the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in China increased by 31.4 times. On 23 February 2020, the number of people diagnosed with COVID\u201019 in China was 1879 times of that on 10 January 2020. They estimated the case fatality rate of COVID\u201019 to be 2.84% based on their patient pool. The authors also found that the ratio of male to female deaths was 3.25:1, the median age of death was 75 years, the median time from the first symptom to death was 14 days, and the median time from early symptoms to death in people aged 70 or older (11.5 days) was shorter than that in people under 70 years old (20 days). These findings suggest the disease may progress faster in the elderly than in the young.",
            "A study by Li et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] showed the median age of 425 patients infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was 59 years, of which 56% were males, the average incubation period was 5.2 days, and almost half of the adult patients were 60 years old or older. In the early stages, the number of infected patients doubled every 7.4 days. The transmission rate of individual infected patients was 2.2. Although 55% of the earliest SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients related to the Huanan seafood market, the number of unrelated cases have increased exponentially since late December 2019.",
            "Huang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] showed among the 41 patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections in their study, 73% of the patients were male, and 32% of the patients had underlying diseases, including diabetes (eight patients), hypertension (six patients), and cardiovascular disease (six patients). The median age was 49 years. Out of the 41 patients, 27 patients were associated with the Huanan seafood market. The case fatality rate among the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients in this study was 15%. A study by Wu et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] estimated the transmission rate of individual infected patients to be 0.3. The case fatality rate among the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients in this study was 14%.",
            "Zhao et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>] found that angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was the receptor for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. In the normal human lung, ACE2 is expressed on type I and II alveolar epithelial cells. Among them, 83% of the type II alveolar cells have ACE2 expression. Men had a higher ACE2 level in their alveolar cells than women. Asians have a higher level of ACE2 expression in their alveolar cells than the White and",
            "African American populations. The binding of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 on ACE2 causes an elevated expression of ACE2, which can lead to damages on alveolar cells. Damages to alveolar cells can, in turn, trigger a series of systemic reactions and even death. They also confirmed that Asian males are more susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Wrapp et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>] found that the receptor\u2010binding ability of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is 10 to 20 times stronger than that of SARS\u2010CoV.",
            "Huang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] found that 98% of the patients in their study had fevers, of which 78% had a temperature higher than 38\u00b0C. They reported that 76% of the patients had coughs, 44% of patients experienced fatigue and muscle pain, and 55% of patients had dyspnea. A small number of patients also developed expectoration (28%), headaches (8%), hemoptysis (5%), and diarrhea (3%). Laboratory tests found that 25% of infected patients had leukopenia and 63% had lymphocytopenia. The level of aspartate aminotransferase was elevated in 37% of the patients. Myocarditis was diagnosed in 12% of the patients, and the level of hypersensitive troponin I was significantly increased in these patients. Abnormalities in chest computed tomography (CT) images were found in 100% of the patients. Grinding glass\u2010like and consolidation areas were found in 98% of the infected patients' bilateral lungs.",
            "Zhu et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] reported three cases of COVID\u201019. Patient 1 was a 49\u2010year\u2010old female with a fever (body temperature 37 to 38\u00b0C) and had coughs accompanied by chest discomfort. Four days after the onset of the disease, her coughs and chest discomfort aggravated, but her fever subsided. Patient 2, a 61\u2010year\u2010old male, also developed fevers and coughs at the initial stage of the disease. Respiratory distress appeared 7 days after the onset of symptoms and worsened within the next 2 days. He was treated with mechanical ventilation. Patient 3 was a 32\u2010year\u2010old male whose symptoms were not described in the article. Patients 1 and 3 recovered and were discharged from hospital after treatment, but patient 2 died after 20 days of treatment.",

They found that fevers (87.9%) and coughs (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea (3.7%) and vomiting (5.0%) were rare. Abnormalities in chest CT images were found in 96% of the SARS\u2010CoV\u2010 2\u2010infected patients, and lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of them.",

At present, the treatments of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection are mainly symptomatic treatments. The study by Huang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] reported that the most common complications in patients with 2019\u2010nCoV infection were acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by anemia, acute heart injuries, and secondary infections. Therefore, empirical antibiotics, antiviral therapy (oseltamivir), and systemic corticosteroids were often used for treatments. Patients with intractable hypoxemia were given invasive mechanical ventilation. Holshue et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>] used remdesivir in the treatment of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and achieved good results.

            "In the absence of effective treatments, the best way to deal with the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic is to control the sources of infection. Strategies include early diagnoses, reporting, isolation, and supportive treatments; timely release of epidemic information; and maintenance of social orders. For individuals, protective measures, including improving personal hygiene, wearing medical masks, adequate rest, and keeping rooms well ventilated, can effectively prevent SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>]"
        ],
        "2 | DISCUSSION": [
            "Regarding the case fatality and transmission rates among patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, the findings from various studies were different. The studies of Wang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>] showed that the case fatality rate was 2.84%. According to Huang et al,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] the number was 15%. The study by Wu et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] estimated that the case fatality rate was 14%. In the study by Zhu et al,[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] the number was 33%. Guan et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>] reported that the case fatality rate was 1.36%. According to the official data released by China, the case fatality of COVID\u201019 patients was 3.17%.2 In terms of the transmission rate, Li et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>] showed that the transmission rate was 2.2 per patient. Wu et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>] estimated that the transmission rate was 0.3 per patient. Yang et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] reported that the transmission rate was 3.77. We think that the transmission rate of 2.2 per patient seems to be more in line with the current situation.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>] Different sample sizes and possible viral variations may have contributed to the differences between the studies. Studies with a larger sample size may give a better estimation of the case fatality rate and transmission rate of the COVID\u201019. We know that the other two major zoonotic coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS which caused widespread transmission have case fatality rates of 9.6% and 35%, respectively.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>] According to the official Chinese data, the case fatality rate among the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients was much lower than that of SARS and MERS.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>]",
            "In response to the COVID\u201019 epidemic, we believe that the focus of future studies will still be on the development of COVID\u201019 vaccines and effective drugs to treat COVID\u201019. These studies will help further reduce the case fatality and transmission rates among SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected patients. Moreover, super\u2010spreaders were reported during the SARS and MERS epidemics.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>] Although the transmission rate for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 patents is about 2.2 at present, the number of cases inside and outside Wuhan is increasing rapidly. With the progress of diagnostic technology, potential super\u2010spreaders may be discovered in the future. In the prevention of the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, asymptomatic spreaders also need to be focused.[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]",
            "In addition, Sheng et al[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] found that viral infections can increase the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, pulmonary fibrosis may be one of the severe complications after patients recover from 2019\u2010nCoV infections. The prevention of pulmonary fibrosis in patients recovered from 2019\u2010nCoV infections is an issue that urgently needs to be addressed."
