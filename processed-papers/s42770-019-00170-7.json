        "abstract": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV, Pestivirus) causes significant economic losses to the livestock industry worldwide. Although serological surveys show that BVDV exposure is widespread in cattle in Uruguay, BVDV-associated diseases are greatly underreported. The aim of this work is to describe the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, and virological findings from spontaneous outbreaks of BVDV-associated diseases in cattle in Uruguay. Diagnostic investigations were performed during 6 spontaneous disease outbreaks on beef and dairy cattle farms in the departments of Colonia, Rio Negro, and Soriano between November 2016 and April 2018. Carcasses of 8 naturally deceased cattle from these outbreaks were necropsied and subjected to histological examination and immunohistochemistry to detect BVDV antigen in the tissues. Reverse transcription real-time PCR and genomic sequencing were also performed to identify BVDV at the species and subtype levels. Other ancillary diagnostic tests, including bacterial cultures, were performed on a case-by-case basis to rule in/out differential diagnoses based on initial clinicopathological presumptive diagnoses. BVDV-associated conditions that were diagnosed in the 8 cases included mucosal disease, transient postnatal BVDV infections associated with digestive/septicemic salmonellosis by Salmonella serovar typhimurium, Histophilus somni bronchopneumonia, urinary tract coinfections with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sp., enteric coinfection with coccidia, and transplacental fetal infections and abortions with Neospora caninum coinfection. BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b were each identified in four of the eight cases. We conclude that BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b contribute significantly to disease and mortality in cattle in Uruguay. Future research should estimate the economic impact of BVDV in the Uruguayan livestock sector.",

            "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome, which belongs to the genus Pestivirus, family Flaviviridae, and is distributed worldwide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. BVDV causes significant economic losses to the dairy and beef livestock industries, which are attributed to morbidity, mortality, growth retardation, reduced milk production, premature culling, reduced reproductive performance, and increased occurrences of other diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The two currently recognized BVDV species are BVDV-1 and BVDV2, and they were recently renamed Pestivirus A and B, respectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. BVDV-1 is the most genetically diverse, with 21 subtypes (BVDV-1a through u) currently recognized, while 4 subtypes (a\u2013d) have been described for BVDV-2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>]. More recently, the Pestivirus HoBi-like virus has been proposed as a<br/><br/>Braz J Microbiol (2020) 51:357\u2013368 new BVDV species (BVDV-3 or Pestivirus H) based on antigenic and genetic similarities [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c10\" href=\"#r10\">10</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c11\" href=\"#r11\">11</a>].<br/><br/>Clinical outcomes of BVDV infection include (a) transient or acute infection with subclinical, respiratory, and/or severe digestive clinical manifestation characterized by high morbidity and variable mortality and generally associated with noncytopathic (NCP) viral strains; (b) reproductive infections, including oocyte/sperm infections that negatively affect fertility, or transplacental/congenital transmission that may result in embryonic or fetal death; mummification; abortion; congenital anomalies; stillbirths; or, if the fetus survives, the birth of persistently infected (PI) calves, particularly when the fetuses are infected by NCP strains before 4 months of gestation; and (c) mucosal disease (MD) characterized by low morbidity and very high lethality in PI animals, usually before 2 years of age. MD is associated with superinfection with a cytopathic (CP) biotype that can arise through mutation, recombination, or genomic rearrangements of the NCP viral strain that infects PI cattle [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]."

Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using random primers and Super-Script II enzyme (Invitrogen\u00ae, USA). Real-time PCR assays targeting a 207-bp fragment of the 5\u2032UTR region of the BVDV were performed using the primers BVDV190F and V326, and the Taq-Man\u00ae probe TQ-Pesti as described by Hoffman et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c23\" href=\"#r23\">23</a>] and Gaede et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c24\" href=\"#r24\">24</a>], respectively, and later modified by Maya et al.<br/><br/>[<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], to detect BVDV-1, BVDV-2, and the HoBi-like Pestivirus.

            "The diagnoses of BVDV infection in 8 cases reported here were based on viral genome detection by RT-qPCR along with detailed pathological examinations to characterize the lesions and IHC to identify BVDV antigen in the tissues of the (bottom) and extensive coagulative necrosis of the adjacent cortical renal tubules with interstitial hemorrhage (acute infarction), H&E stain deceased cattle. The BVDV subtype involved in all cases was identified by sequencing the 5\u2032UTR genomic region. Ancillary tests were performed to identify coinfections and to rule in/out differential diagnoses on a case-by-case basis (Online Resource 1). Diagnostic investigations in the 8 cases were compatible with different BVDV infection outcomes, including MD (case 1 and eventually case 6), transplacental/ congenital transmission with potential transient/acute fetal infection (cases 2, 7, and 8), transient/acute postnatal infections associated with coinfections by pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella typhimurium (case 3) and Histophilus somni (case 4), or opportunistic bacteria, such as Streptococcus sp. and E. coli (case 5), or eventually severely transient infection associated with enteric coccidia (case 6).<br/><br/>The clinical signs and pathological findings in the heifer from outbreak 1 were those typically described in the literature for MD cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Detection of the viral genome and the colocalization of BVDV antigen intralesionally by IHC confirmed the etiological diagnosis, while other causes of necrotizing colitis, such as Salmonella spp. and bovine coronavirus, were ruled out [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>]."

            "BVDV causes pathology and is associated with diseases and mortality in beef and dairy cattle in Uruguay. More extensive and systematic studies are necessary to determine the epidemiology and economic impacts of BVDV for livestock in Uruguay as well as the distribution and frequency of the different species/subtypes involved in clinical settings. Costbenefit analyses and feasibility studies could help establish preventive and control programs for BVDV at the farm, regional, and national levels."

            "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome, which belongs to the genus Pestivirus, family Flaviviridae, and is distributed worldwide [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. BVDV causes significant economic losses to the dairy and beef livestock industries, which are attributed to morbidity, mortality, growth retardation, reduced milk production, premature culling, reduced reproductive performance, and increased occurrences of other diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c2\" href=\"#r2\">2</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c3\" href=\"#r3\">3</a>]. The two currently recognized BVDV species are BVDV-1 and BVDV2, and they were recently renamed Pestivirus A and B, respectively [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>]. BVDV-1 is the most genetically diverse, with 21 subtypes (BVDV-1a through u) currently recognized, while 4 subtypes (a\u2013d) have been described for BVDV-2 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c6\" href=\"#r6\">6</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>].

            "Clinical outcomes of BVDV infection include (a) transient or acute infection with subclinical, respiratory, and/or severe digestive clinical manifestation characterized by high morbidity and variable mortality and generally associated with noncytopathic (NCP) viral strains; (b) reproductive infections, including oocyte/sperm infections that negatively affect fertility, or transplacental/congenital transmission that may result in embryonic or fetal death; mummification; abortion; congenital anomalies; stillbirths; or, if the fetus survives, the birth of persistently infected (PI) calves, particularly when the fetuses are infected by NCP strains before 4 months of gestation; and (c) mucosal disease (MD) characterized by low morbidity and very high lethality in PI animals, usually before 2 years of age. MD is associated with superinfection with a cytopathic (CP) biotype that can arise through mutation, recombination, or genomic rearrangements of the NCP viral strain that infects PI cattle [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].",
            "As viruses with worldwide distribution [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c9\" href=\"#r9\">9</a>], BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 have been recognized for many years in South American countries, including Brazil [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c14\" href=\"#r14\">14</a>], Argentina [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c15\" href=\"#r15\">15</a>], Colombia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c16\" href=\"#r16\">16</a>], Peru, Chile [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>], and Uruguay [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], while the Pestivirus HoBi-like virus has currently only been identified in Argentina [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>] and Brazil [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c20\" href=\"#r20\">20</a>] on this subcontinent. In Uruguay, the first evidence of BVDV circulation dates from 1996 [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. A serological study revealed that BVDV exposure is widespread in beef cattle throughout Uruguay [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. More recently, active BVDV infections and circulating species and subtypes were explored in cattle herds with reproductive problems, and BVDV-1a was revealed as the predominant species/ subtype, followed by BVDV-1i and BVDV-2b [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>].",

Briefly, heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed by placing the deparaffinized sections in a decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical) at 110 \u00b0C for 30 s. A commercially available anti-BVDV monoclonal antibody isotype IgG2a produced in mice (catalogue D89, VMRD, Pullman, WA, USA) was applied as the primary antibody for 45 min at a 1:20 dilution. An anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2013 labeled polymer (EnVision+ HRP goat anti-mouse IgG, K4001, Dako) was used as the detection system, with 3amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC no. 3469, Dako) as the substrate chromogen. A FFPE section of archived intestine from a naturally infected calf that tested positive for BVDV by RTPCR and IHC was used as a positive control. For the negative controls, serial sections of all tested tissues were processed in parallel as described above, but the primary antibody was replaced with normal mouse serum (NC499L, Biocare Medical) at the same dilution."

            "The clinical signs and pathological findings in the heifer from outbreak 1 were those typically described in the literature for MD cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. Detection of the viral genome and the colocalization of BVDV antigen intralesionally by IHC confirmed the etiological diagnosis, while other causes of necrotizing colitis, such as Salmonella spp. and bovine coronavirus, were ruled out [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].",
            "The occurrence of MD requires the presence of PI animals congenitally infected with BVDV, which are the main source of infections in the herds. PI cattle are viremic, lifelong viral shedders, and immunotolerant to the NCP strain with which they are infected because their immune systems do not recognize the BVDV antigens as foreign, thus leading to extensive viral replication in the target cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c27\" href=\"#r27\">27</a>]. In our case, viremia was confirmed by identifying BVDV-1a in the serum, while IHC allowed detecting abundant viral antigen in the alimentary tract tissues (esophagus, small, and large intestines), which showed typical MD lesions. MD occurs in PI animals when the NCP BVDV strain is converted to the cytopathic biotype via mutation, recombination, and/or genomic rearrangements. Generally, the NS2/3 viral protease containing the NCP strain is cleaved to NS2 and NS3 in the cytopathic strains [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c28\" href=\"#r28\">28</a>]. This results in a devastating infection that destroys the host cells, to which the animal\u2019s immune system cannot respond [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].",
            "PI neonate calves may be clinically normal, weak, born smaller than normal, or show growth retardation; however, most die of MD before 2 years of age [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c12\" href=\"#r12\">12</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], which is the same age range of the heifer with MD in case 1. The 4-yearold steer in outbreak 5 (case 6) presented severe intestinal histological lesions compatible with MD, although no macroscopic lesions typical of MD were observed in the digestive tract. This reinforces the idea that PI animals can remain asymptomatic in the herds for more than 2 years, perpetuating infection and disease. In BVDV PI cattle, IHC should show strong positive immunolabeling in all or most tissues/organs, since infection in these animals is disseminated/ multisystemic, and the tissues usually contain high viral loads [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. The strong widespread intra- and extralesional immunolabeling in the lungs, intestines, liver, and kidneys of case 6, along with the viral genome detected in the serum, indicated that this steer was viremic and most likely represented a PI animal.",
            "Fetal responses to BVDV infection are influenced mainly by gestational age, fetal immune response, and viral biotype and subtype [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>]. Abortions at 6\u20138 gestational months identified as cases 2 and 8 in this work were most likely caused by N. caninum given the nature of the fetal lesions, which were typical of this protozoan, and its intralesional detection via IHC in the brain/myocardium as well as by PCR in the brain in both cases. However, coinfections with BVDV-1a (case 2) and BVDV-2b (case 8) were identified by RT-qPCR/ sequencing, indicating a congenital/transplacental circulation and transmission of both viral species/subtypes in these fetuses. Because fetuses infected with NCP BVDV strains before the 4th gestational month are generally immunotolerant to",
            "Fetuses that survive NCP BVDV strain infections before day 90, and more rarely up to day 125 of gestation, invariably develop immunotolerance to the virus and are born PI [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c33\" href=\"#r33\">33</a>]. Immunotolerance is postulated to be mediated by the virus\u2019s ability to inhibit type I interferon production in infected fetal cells, allowing the infection to persist [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c34\" href=\"#r34\">34</a>]. However, depending on the gestational age and viral strain, transplacental infection can also result in embryonic/fetal death (reabsorption, mummification, or abortion), congenital malformations, or birth of clinically healthy calves [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c30\" href=\"#r30\">30</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>].",
            "BVDV subtyping of the case 2 fetus (outbreak 2) was identified as BVDV-1a, while for the case 7 and 8 fetuses (outbreak 6), subtyping was identified as BVDV-2b. Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>] reported that both BVDV-2 and BVDV-1b have a similar tissue tropism, although BVDV-2 passes through the placenta more quickly. Additionally, antigenic immunolabeling in the fetal tissues was more intense for BVDV-2 than for BVDV-1b [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c29\" href=\"#r29\">29</a>]. In the 3 fetuses evaluated in our study, BVDV immunolabeling was negative in all analyzed tissues, independent of the infecting viral species/subtype. This finding suggests that the fetuses were not PI, but rather were acutely/transiently infected, which may or may not have contributed to abortion due to N. caninum in cases 2 and 8 as discussed previously. When infection occurs in the last third of gestation, the fetal bovine immune system is sufficiently developed to respond to the virus, being comparable with a transient postnatal infection [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c35\" href=\"#r35\">35</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>]. Serological assays to assess whether these fetuses had developed specific humoral responses to BVDV were not performed in our study.",
            "Transient/acute BVDV infections are largely subclinical or cause mild clinical signs, although they can induce leukopenia (lymphopenia, monocytopenia) and reduce antibody production and neutrophil release and function, resulting in immunosuppression. Such immunosuppression favors secondary bacterial and/or viral infections [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>] that can contribute to respiratory, digestive, or septicemic diseases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c37\" href=\"#r37\">37</a>]. In the three animals from outbreaks 3 and 4 (cases 3\u20135), BVDV infection likely contributed to the occurrence of pneumonic histophilosis (case 3), enteric/septicemic salmonellosis (case 4), and septicemia or urinary infection by opportunistic pathogens such as Streptococcus sp. and E. coli (case 5). These coinfections were confirmed by isolating the bacterial agents involved in each case, and their pathogenic role was established by evaluating the lesions compatible with those caused by these agents in the respective pathological examinations.",
            "Acquiring animals without checking their BVDV infection status is an important risk factor for BVDV infection in cattle herds. This is directly related to introducing PI animals that can carry the infection or new viral strains into the herds [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c38\" href=\"#r38\">38</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c41\" href=\"#r41\">41</a>]. In 3 of the outbreaks reported here (outbreaks 3\u20135), the anamnestic information revealed that cattle from different origins were introduced and mixed into the herds without prior BVDV testing, which possibly contributed to disseminating and spreading infection and disease between farms. Detecting and removing infected cattle from the herds is key in controlling BVDV infections.",
            "BVDV-2 is generally considered more virulent, being frequently related to disease and death [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c36\" href=\"#r36\">36</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>]. However, in a study conducted in the USA, both BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 were diagnosed in cattle with clinical respiratory and digestive manifestations, as well as in necropsied cattle [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>], with BVDV-1 being the most common species [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c42\" href=\"#r42\">42</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c43\" href=\"#r43\">43</a>]. BVDV1a (cases 1, 5, and 6) and BVDV-2b (cases 3 and 4) were identified in heifers/steers in our work, indicating that both species are related to postnatal morbidity and mortality in cattle in Uruguay. In other South American countries, clinical disease has been reported for BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b, BVDV2a, and BVDV-2b in Argentina [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c44\" href=\"#r44\">44</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c46\" href=\"#r46\">46</a>]; BVDV-1b, BVDV1d, BVDV-1i, and BVDV-2b in Brazil [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c47\" href=\"#r47\">47</a>\u2013<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c50\" href=\"#r50\">50</a>]; and BVDV1a, BVDV-1b, and BVDV-1c in Chile and Peru [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c17\" href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c51\" href=\"#r51\">51</a>].",
            "Although cattle exposed to BVDV in utero constitute a significant portion of clinical presentations, cases of transient/acute postnatal infection may be significant sources of direct losses [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c1\" href=\"#r1\">1</a>]. Several of the deaths reported in outbreaks 3 and 4 (cases 3\u20135) were likely due to transient/acute BVDV infections aggravated by secondary bacterial infections. The arteriolitis observed in case 3 is a lesion frequently found in BVDV cases [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>], whereas it is not a typical finding in salmonellosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c52\" href=\"#r52\">52</a>], the agent with which this calf was coinfected. This case presented typical lesions of both agents, and although Salmonella typhimurium can cause disease and death by itself, it also behaves as an opportunistic pathogen, and thus, in this case, the BVDV may have predisposed to clinical salmonellosis. Additional evidence of transient/acute infection in these cases included detection of intralesional BVDV antigens by IHC in only some of the calf tissues examined by this technique.",
            "The IHC performed in this study used a commercial monoclonal primary antibody against BVDV glycoprotein 55 (envelope glycoprotein E2) made using the BVDV NADL strain. Although this antibody binds to and cross-reacts with most BVDV strains, it does not bind to some strains (such as Oregon C24V used to produce vaccines in the USA) per the manufacturer and published information [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c53\" href=\"#r53\">53</a>]. The major glycoprotein E2 is the most variable and immunodominant glycoprotein in BVDV, and as such, some strains may not bind to this antibody [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c54\" href=\"#r54\">54</a>]. Our results indicated that this procedure enabled identifying at least four Uruguayan field strains: three BVDV-1a strains from outbreaks 1, 4, and 5, and one BVDV2b strain from outbreak 3. However, additional crossneutralization studies should be performed to assess whether this antibody cross-reacts with other local field BVDV strains, since reduced reactivity of anti-BVDV antibodies has been identified to cause failed detection of field isolates (particularly BVDV-2a) [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c55\" href=\"#r55\">55</a>].",
            "In Uruguay, a serological study conducted in beef cattle in 2000\u20132001 indicated that 69% of 6358 animals were seropositive and that 100% of 230 herds had at least one seropositive animal [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. Even with a high viral circulation in the country\u2019s cattle population, only 3% of farmers implement preventive vaccinations [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. More recently, active BVDV infections in cattle in Uruguay were explored in a study in which 390 serum samples from 14 herds were analyzed to search for viral antigens by capture ELISA and for viral genomes by RT-qPCR. Sixteen (4.1%) of these animals were positive by both techniques [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>], suggesting that they were either PI animals and/or acute/transient infections acquired postnatally. Interestingly, the mortality rate was 3.5% in the herd with MD from outbreak 1 in our study, suggesting, hypothetically, that 3.5% of this herd could have been PI animals, a value close to that found by Maya et al [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Although the prevalence of PI animals in a herd is generally < 2%, it can be as high as 25\u2013 30% in herds where many cows/heifers were exposed to NCP BVDV strains during early pregnancy [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c13\" href=\"#r13\">13</a>].",
            "The only published study to explore BVDV genetic diversity in Uruguay found that the main species/subtype was BVDV-1a [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>]. Coincidentally, this subtype was found in the MD case (outbreak 1) and in outbreaks 2, 4, and 5 described herein, indicating that, besides being frequent, this subtype is associated with disease and death in cattle, which is unprecedented in Uruguay in the scientific literature. Based on our results, BVDV-2b can also be regarded as a significant cause of disease in Uruguay. In addition, this work expands the geographical distribution (south) and the biotype of infected cattle (dairy) in Uruguay for BVDV-2b, since this subtype had previously been detected only in beef cattle in the department of Rivera, in northern Uruguay [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c18\" href=\"#r18\">18</a>].",
            "Vaccines commercially available for BVDV prevention in Uruguay are manufactured with inactivated virus and can only provide partial protection, unlike modified-live vaccines used in other regions [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c56\" href=\"#r56\">56</a>], including South American countries such as Brazil [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c57\" href=\"#r57\">57</a>]. Recent investigations in Argentina have led to developing an enhanced BVDV subunit vaccine expressed in a baculovirus, based on a truncated E2 glycoprotein fused to a single-chain antibody that targets antigenpresenting cells [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c58\" href=\"#r58\">58</a>]. This vaccine\u2019s immunogenicity was tested in guinea pigs and cattle, and immunized cattle developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against BVDV up to 1 year after immunization. Based on these results, the vaccine was scaled up and registered and is being commercialized as the first Argentinean subunit vaccine for cattle [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c59\" href=\"#r59\">59</a>]. Whether these vaccines protect against Uruguayan BVDV strains remains to be addressed."
        ],
        "Conclusions": [
            "BVDV causes pathology and is associated with diseases and mortality in beef and dairy cattle in Uruguay. More extensive and systematic studies are necessary to determine the epidemiology and economic impacts of BVDV for livestock in Uruguay as well as the distribution and frequency of the different species/subtypes involved in clinical settings. Costbenefit analyses and feasibility studies could help establish preventive and control programs for BVDV at the farm, regional, and national levels."
