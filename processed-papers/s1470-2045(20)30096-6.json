            "We observed similar results when the severe events were defined both by the above objective events and physician evaluation (nine [50%] of 18 patients vs 245 [16%] of 1572 patients; Fisher\u2019s exact p=0\u00b70008). Moreover, patients who underwent chemotherapy or surgery in the past month had a numerically higher risk (three [75%] of four patients) of clinically severe events than did those not receiving chemotherapy or surgery (six [43%] of 14 patients; figure). These odds were further confirmed by logistic regression (odds ratio [OR] 5\u00b734, 95% CI 1\u00b780\u201316\u00b718; p=0\u00b70026) after adjusting for other risk factors, including age, smoking history, and other comorbidities. Cancer history represented the highest risk for severe events (appendix p 3). Among patients with cancer, older age was the only risk factor for severe events (OR 1\u00b743, 95% CI 0\u00b797\u20132\u00b712; p=0\u00b7072). Patients with lung cancer did not have a higher probability of severe events compared with patients with other cancer types (one [20%] of five patients with lung cancer vs eight [62%] of 13 patients with other types of cancer; p=0\u00b7294). Additionally, we used a Cox regression model to evaluate the time-dependent hazards of developing severe events, and found that patients with cancer deteriorated more rapidly than those without cancer (median time to severe events 13 days [IQR 6\u201315] vs 43 days [20\u2013not reached]; p<0\u00b70001; hazard ratio 3\u00b756, 95% CI 1\u00b765\u20137\u00b769, after adjusting for age; figure).",
            "In this study, we analysed the risk for severe COVID-19 in patients with cancer for the first time, to our knowledge; only by nationwide analysis can we follow up patients with rare but important comorbidities, such as cancer. We found that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of COVID-19 than individuals without cancer. Additionally, we showed that patients with cancer had poorer outcomes from COVID-19, providing a timely reminder to physicians that more intensive attention should be paid to patients with cancer, in case of rapid deterioration.",
            "Therefore, we propose three major strategies for patients with cancer in this COVID-19 crisis, and in future attacks of severe infectious diseases. First, an intentional postponing of adjuvant chemot\u00ad herapy or elective surgery for stable cancer should be considered in endemic areas. Second, stronger personal protection provisions should be made for patients with cancer or cancer survivors. Third, more intensive surveillance or treatment should be considered when patients with cancer are infected with SARS-CoV-2, especially in older patients or those with other comorbidities.",

            "Should patients who are incarcerated on death row receive palliative cancer care?",
            "In modern society, it is accepted that individuals have the right to die with dignity. Since 1976, in the USA, people who are incarcerated have a limited constitutional right to health care, consistent with the Eighth Amendment. At present, there are more than 2600 incarcerated men and women in the USA who have been sentenced to death, most of whom have less than a high school diploma or High School Equivalency Certificate (GED), and are disproportionately of minority racial or ethnic backgrounds (42% African-American representation on death row vs 13% African-American representation in the US census).1",
            "The combination of poor health status, social determinants of health, and paucity of adequate care provided in correctional facilities is driving a public health emergency, which is endangering the North American incarcerated population. We can expect the prevalence and burden of chronic illness to rise concomitantly with the growth of the ageing population in US prisons.2 Data suggest that cancer is the leading cause of illness-related deaths in US state prisons.2 In the absence of reform, the mass incarceration trends observed over the past three decades will substantially widen disparities, adversely affecting access to health care.",
            "As the US prison population ages, and with it the subpopulation of individuals sentenced to death, the burden of cancer can be expected to increase. This increase will be accompanied by the inevitable debate over the appropriate health care, both legally and morally, for those with end-stage cancer. This dilemma is bound to have a downstream effect on patients with cancer who have been sentenced to death and can affect the quality of palliative care provided in correctional facilities. In the community, a multidisciplinary team would manage the medical, mental health, and social service needs of a patient who chooses palliative care for a terminal diagnosis. But what of the patient who is sentenced to die by judicial execution? That any such person should receive a benefit of any sort, including the traditional last meal, is met with public protest and outrage. Such consternation will probably increase despite the fact that denying palliative care results in unnecessary suffering for the patient at no benefit to public safety.",
            "It is well established that professional ethics forbids health-care staff from participating in any aspect of capital punishment. However, what of the incarcerated patient with cancer who is dying under the care of a physician with direct or indirect duties to the jurisdiction charged with judicial execution? What are the duties of the physician expected to provide palliative care to the incarcerated if the patient desires it? We argue that they are no different than those incumbent upon the physician and health-care staff in the community. The accepted framework of medico\u2013 ethical principles requires that oncology practitioners consider pain relief and other principles of palliative www.thelancet.com/oncology Vol 21 March 2020"
