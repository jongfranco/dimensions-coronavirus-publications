        "abstract": "Objective: This study presents a preliminary report on the chest radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in Korea. Materials and Methods: As part of a multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. Results: Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). Conclusion: COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs. Keywords: Coronavirus; Pneumonia; COVID-19; Chest X-ray; Computed tomography",

            "In conclusion, COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea generally manifested as pure GGO to mixed GGO and consolidative lesions in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. The shape of the lesions was typically ill-defined and patchy to confluent, or nodular. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed along the pleura, whereas nodular lesions were mainly distributed along the bronchovascular bundles. Most of the pulmonary lesions were ambiguous on chest radiographs. Clinicians and radiologists should become familiar with the CT findings of COVID-19 and the https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0132 kjronline.org limitations of chest radiographs in evaluating pneumonia to manage the COVID-19 outbreak."

            "This study presents a preliminary report on the chest radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in Korea. Materials and Methods: As part of a multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. Results: Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). Conclusion: COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs. Keywords: Coronavirus; Pneumonia; COVID-19; Chest X-ray; Computed tomography"

However, the proportion of predominantly consolidative lesions in Chinese patients was approximately 30% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c4\" href=\"#r4\">4</a>] to 60% [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c5\" href=\"#r5\">5</a>], but the Korean patients did not have predominantly consolidative lesions. Furthermore, the proportion of chest radiographic abnormalities was 60% in Chinese COVID-19 patients [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>], but 33% in Korean patients. Considering these radiologic observations and the lack of deaths from COVID-19 in Korea, Korean patients seem to experience a milder disease course than Chinese patients.",
            "Interestingly, we observed a reversed halo sign in one patient (Fig. 3B), and a few similar cases have been reported in recent reports [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c19\" href=\"#r19\">19</a>-<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>]. The reversed halo sign was first regarded as specific for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and it can be seen in various infectious diseases, including angioinvasive pulmonary aspergillosis or mucormycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and tuberculosis [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c22\" href=\"#r22\">22</a>]. This sign might reflect an organizing pneumonia pattern in COVID-19 pneumonia [<a class=\"ref-link\" id=\"c21\" href=\"#r21\">21</a>].",
            "A few limitations exist in this study. First, the number of included patients was small, and the included patients only accounted for approximately one-third of all 29 identified patients of COVID-19 in Korea as of February 16, 2020. Including more patients would enable a more comprehensive description of the radiologic findings of COVID-19. However, we weighed this consideration against the importance of urgent reporting. Second, we focused on baseline CT findings that clinicians and radiologists first encountered, rather than findings from follow-up CT scans, as follow-up CT scans were performed in few patients. Third, we minimized the clinical information of the patients, as a substantial proportion of the included patients were receiving inpatient treatment at the time of the analysis.",
            "In conclusion, COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea generally manifested as pure GGO to mixed GGO and consolidative lesions in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. The shape of the lesions was typically ill-defined and patchy to confluent, or nodular. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed along the pleura, whereas nodular lesions were mainly distributed along the bronchovascular bundles. Most of the pulmonary lesions were ambiguous on chest radiographs. Clinicians and radiologists should become familiar with the CT findings of COVID-19 and the https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0132 kjronline.org limitations of chest radiographs in evaluating pneumonia to manage the COVID-19 outbreak.",
