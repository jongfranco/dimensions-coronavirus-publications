Restrictions on performing Umrah is a highly sensitive geopolitical propo\u00ad sition that requires further vetting, especially when multiple countries are affected.",

Voluntary postponement of Umrah visits might be proposed for elderly pilgrims and pilgrims with chronic and underlying conditions until the COVID-19 epidemic is under control. Adequate quarantine infrastructure should be available.
