            "There were two notable operational challenges the de-isolation of suspect cases. With substantial numbers of suspect cases admitted for isolation and the need to hold patients for repeated testing, there was a need to manage isolation room occupancy. However, for patients who needed ongoing inpatient care for other reasons, we also needed to address the risk of inadvertent nosocomial amplification, to reduce the risk of transmission from patients who had tested negative early in their clinical illness. A rigorous framework was required to help clinicians de-isolate COVID-19 patients safely."
